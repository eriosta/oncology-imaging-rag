By this logic, stress radiographs of the ankle joint would involve a stress maneuver, since the stress applied is intended to test the stability of the joint.  Similarly, weight-bearing radiographs of the foot would involve a weight-bearing maneuver, since the act of standing is intended to assess bony alignment under load-carrying conditions.  Carrying this logic further, terms indicating the absence of a challenge would also be maneuver terms, such as “without maneuver”. [Radlex 9-28-2016]",,

This is a special case of the zipper in readout direction in which there is also a zipper in the phase encoding direction.

RID11407,eddy currents,"Eddy currents are small electric currents induced by rapid gradient oscillations. The eddy currents cause magnetic gradients to develop more slowly and to persist for longer duration than intended by the pulse sequence design. These effects may distort the image or accelerate dephasing and lead to signal loss. The signal loss may exhibit a complex pattern if there is interference between spin echoes and stimulated echoes. Eddy currents also may cause misalignment of the planes of the excitation and refocusing pulses, leading to non-uniform signal intensity across the image.",,
RID11408,non-uniform signal intensity artifact,An artifact resulting from non-uniform signal intensities across the imaging field.,,
RID11409,surface coil sensitivity artifact,This refers to the spatially varying sensitivity of the receiver surface coil. It results in progressive loss of signal (shading) as a function of distance from surface coil.,intensity gradient artifact; near-field artifact,
RID11412,receiver coil-transmitter coil coupling,Coupling of the receiver coil and transmitter coil causes the receiver coil to act as parasitic transmitter and results in RF flip angle inhomogeneity. This produces uneven contrast and patchy or non-uniform variation in signal intensity (see below).,,
RID11413,conductivity artifact,"the B1 field (which is a rapidly changing magnetic field) induces a circulating electrical field. In turn, the induced electrical field induces a magnetic field that opposes the B1 field.

RID11414,standing wave-related effect,"If the wavelength of the RF pulse approximates the size of the object being imaged, a standing wave may result within the object.

RID11426,ghost,"Ghosts are defined as secondary images appearing in locations that differ from the primary image. Ghosts occur along phase encoding direction regardless of direction moved. Distance between ghosts increases as the number of periodic motions between TRs increases – hence, increases with frequency of motion and with TR. The distance also increases with number of signal averages. Ghosts may be high or low signal depending on whether they are in phase or out of phase with the object they overlie. If the TR is so short that motion does not repeat between excitations, then periodic motion causes edge smearing (as with random motion) rather than ghost generation.",coherent ghost; ghost artifact; image harmonic; image harmonic artifact; phase shift artifact; replica; replica artifact,

The stripe is 3–4 cm in height and extends from approximately the level of the medial ends of the clavicles to the right tracheobronchial angle on a frontal chest radiograph (120). It is seen in up to 94% of adults but is widened or absent in individuals with abundant mediastinal fat. The commonest pathologic cause of widening, deformity, or obliteration of this stripe is paratracheal lymph node enlargement.  [Fleischner Society]",,

RID28495,bleb,"Anatomy.—A bleb is a small gas-containing space within the visceral pleura or in the subpleural lung, not larger than 1 cm in diameter (25). 
CT scans.—A bleb appears as a thin-walled cystic air space contiguous with the pleura. Because the arbitrary (size) distinction between a bleb and bulla is of little clinical importance, the use of this term by radiologists is discouraged. [Fleischner Society]",,
RID28500,bronchocentric,"CT scans.—This descriptor is applied to disease that is conspicuously centered on macroscopic bronchovascular bundles (Fig 14). Examples of diseases with a bronchocentric distribution include sarcoidosis (35), Kaposi sarcoma (36), and organizing pneumonia (37). [Fleischner Society]",,
RID28501,broncholith,"Pathology.—A broncholith, a calcified peribronchial lymph node that erodes into an adjacent bronchus, is most often the consequence of Histoplasma or tuberculous infection. 
Radiographs and CT scans.—The imaging appearance is of a small calcific focus in or immediately adjacent to an airway (Fig 15), most frequently the right middle lobe bronchus. Broncholiths are readily identified on CT scans (38). Distal obstructive changes may include atelectasis, mucoid impaction, and bronchiectasis.  [Fleischner Society]",,
RID28502,bulla,"Pathology.—An airspace measuring more than 1 cm—usually several centimeters—in diameter, sharply demarcated by a thin wall that is no greater than 1 mm in thickness. A bulla is usually accompanied by emphysematous changes in the adjacent lung. (See also bullous emphysema.) 
Radiographs and CT scans.—A bulla appears as a rounded focal lucency or area of decreased attenuation, 1 cm or more in diameter, bounded by a thin wall (Fig 16). Multiple bullae are often present and are associated with other signs of pulmonary emphysema (centrilobular and paraseptal). [Fleischner Society]",,
RID28503,bullous emphysema,"Pathology.—Bullous emphysema is bullous destruction of the lung parenchyma, usually on a background of paraseptal or panacinar emphysema. (See also emphysema, bulla.) [Fleischner Society]",,
RID28504,centrilobular emphysema,"Pathology.—Centrilobular emphysema is characterized by destroyed centrilobular alveolar walls and enlargement of respiratory bronchioles and associated alveoli (42,43). This is the commonest form of emphysema in cigarette smokers. 
CT scans.—CT findings are centrilobular areas of decreased attenuation, usually without visible walls, of nonuniform distribution and predominantly located in upper lung zones (44) (Fig 18). The term centriacinar emphysema is synonymous. (See also emphysema.)  [Fleischner Society]",,
RID28505,centrilobular,"Anatomy.—Centrilobular describes the region of the bronchiolovascular core of a secondary pulmonary lobule (4,39,40). This term is also used by pathologists to describe the location of lesions beyond the terminal bronchiole that center on respiratory bronchioles or even alveolar ducts. 
CT scans.–A small dotlike or linear opacity in the center of a normal secondary pulmonary lobule, most obvious within 1 cm of a pleural surface, represents the intralobular artery (approximately 1 mm in diameter) (41). Centrilobular abnormalities include (a) nodules, (b) a tree-in-bud pattern indicating small-airways disease, (c) increased visibility of centrilobular structures due to thickening or infiltration of the adjacent interstitium, or (d) abnormal areas of low attenuation caused by centrilobular emphysema (4). (See also lobular core structures.)  [Fleischner Society]",,
RID28507,mycetoma,,fungus ball,
RID28508,chronic fibrosing interstitial pneumonia,,,
RID28510,interlobular septal thickening,"Radiographs and CT scans.—This finding is seen on chest radiographs as thin linear opacities at right angles to and in contact with the lateral pleural surfaces near the lung bases (Kerley B lines); it is seen most frequently in lymphangitic spread of cancer or pulmonary edema. Kerley A lines are predominantly situated in the upper lobes, are 2–6 cm long, and can be seen as fine lines radially oriented toward the hila. In recent years, the anatomically descriptive terms septal lines and septal thickening have gained favor over Kerley lines. On CT scans, disease affecting one of the components of the septa (see interlobular septum) may be responsible for thickening and so render septa visible. On thin-section CT scans, septal thickening may be smooth or nodular (70) (Fig 28), which may help refine the differential diagnosis. (See also interlobular septum, beaded septum.) [Fleischner Society]",,
RID28511,interstitial emphysema,"Pathology.—Interstitial emphysema is characterized by air dissecting within the interstitium of the lung, typically in the peribronchovascular sheaths, interlobular septa, and visceral pleura. It is most commonly seen in neonates receiving mechanical ventilation. 
Radiographs and CT scans.—Interstitial emphysema is rarely recognized radiographically in adults and is infrequently seen on CT scans (Fig 30). It appears as perivascular lucent or low-attenuating halos and small cysts. [Fleischner Society]",,
RID28512,interstitium,"Anatomy.—The interstitium consists of a continuum of connective tissue throughout the lung comprising three subdivisions: (a) the bronchovascular (axial) interstitium, surrounding and supporting the bronchi, arteries, and veins from the hilum to the level of the respiratory bronchiole; (b) the parenchymal (acinar) interstitium, situated between alveolar and capillary basement membranes; and (c) the subpleural connective tissue contiguous with the interlobular septa (73).  [Fleischner Society]",,
RID28513,linear atelectasis,"Pathophysiology.—Atelectasis is reduced inflation of all or part of the lung (20). One of the commonest mechanisms is resorption of air distal to airway obstruction (eg, an endobronchial neoplasm) (21). The synonym collapse is often used interchangeably with atelectasis, particularly when it is severe or accompanied by obvious increase in lung opacity. 
Radiographs and CT scans.—Reduced volume is seen, accompanied by increased opacity (chest radiograph) or attenuation (CT scan) in the affected part of the lung (Fig 8). Atelectasis is often associated with abnormal displacement of fissures, bronchi, vessels, diaphragm, heart, or mediastinum (22). The distribution can be lobar, segmental, or subsegmental. Atelectasis is often qualified by descriptors such as linear, discoid, or platelike. (See also linear atelectasis, rounded atelectasis.)  [Fleischner Society]",discoid atelectasis; platelike atelectasis,
RID28515,lymphoid interstitial pneumonia,"Pathology.—LIP is a rare disease characterized by diffuse pulmonary lymphoid proliferation with predominant interstitial involvement. It is included in the spectrum of interstitial pneumonias and is distinct from diffuse lymphomas of the lung. Features include diffuse hyperplasia of bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue and diffuse polyclonal lymphoid cell infiltrates surrounding the airways and expanding the lung interstitium. LIP is usually associated with autoimmune diseases or human immunodeficiency virus infection (5,81). 
CT scans.—Ground-glass opacity is the dominant abnormality, and thin-walled perivascular cysts may be present (Fig 37). Lung nodules, a reticular pattern, interlobular septal and bronchovascular thickening, and widespread consolidation may also occur (82,83).  [Fleischner Society]",,
RID28516,mediastinal compartment,"Anatomy.—Nominal anatomic compartments of the mediastinum include the anterior, middle, posterior, and (in some schemes) superior compartments. The anterior compartment is bounded anteriorly by the sternum and posteriorly by the anterior surface of the pericardium, the ascending aorta, and the brachiocephalic vessels. The middle compartment is bounded by the posterior margin of the anterior division and the anterior margin of the posterior division. The posterior compartment is bounded anteriorly by the posterior margins of the pericardium and great vessels and posteriorly by the thoracic vertebral bodies. In the four-compartment model, the superior compartment is defined as the compartment above the plane between the sternal angle to the T4-5 intervertebral disk or, more simply, above the aortic arch (84,85). Exact anatomic boundaries between the compartments do not exist, and there are no barriers (other than the pericardium) to prevent the spread of disease between compartments. Other classifications exist, but the three- and four-compartment models are the most commonly used. [Fleischner Society]",,
RID28518,organizing pneumonia,"Pathology.—Organizing pneumonia manifests as a histologic pattern characterized by loose plugs of connective tissue in the airspaces and distal airways. Interstitial inflammation and fibrosis are minimal or absent. Cryptogenic organizing pneumonia, or COP, is a distinctive clinical disorder among the idiopathic interstitial pneumonias (5), but the histologic pattern of organizing pneumonia is encountered in many different situations, including pulmonary infection, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and collagen vascular diseases. 
Radiographs and CT scans.—Airspace consolidation is the cardinal feature of organizing pneumonia on chest radiographs and CT scans. In COP, the distribution is typically subpleural and basal (Fig 45) and sometimes bronchocentric (96). Other manifestations of organizing pneumonia include ground-glass opacity, tree-in-bud pattern, and nodular opacities (37).  [Fleischner Society]",,
RID28519,panacinar emphysema,"Pathology.—Panacinar emphysema involves all portions of the acinus and secondary pulmonary lobule more or less uniformly (42). It predominates in the lower lobes and is the form of emphysema associated with α1-antitrypsin deficiency. 
CT scans.—Panacinar emphysema manifests as a generalized decrease of the lung parenchyma with a decrease in the caliber of blood vessels in the affected lung (97,98) (Fig 46). Severe panacinar emphysema may coexist and merge with severe centrilobular emphysema. The appearance of featureless decreased attenuation may be indistinguishable from severe constrictive obliterative bronchiolitis (99). The term panlobular emphysema is synonymous. (See also emphysema.)  [Fleischner Society]",,
RID2852,conjoined tendon,,falx inguinalis; henle ligament; inguinal falx; tendo conjunctivus,
RID28520,paraseptal emphysema,"Pathology.—Paraseptal emphysema is characterized by predominant involvement of the distal alveoli and their ducts and sacs. It is characteristically bounded by any pleural surface and the interlobular septa (42,43). 
CT scans.—This emphysema is characterized by subpleural and peribronchovascular regions of low attenuation separated by intact interlobular septa (Fig 47), sometimes associated with bullae. The term distal acinar emphysema is synonymous. (See also emphysema.)  [Fleischner Society]",,
RID28521,peribronchovascular interstitium,"Anatomy.—The peribronchovascular interstitium is a connective-tissue sheath that encloses the bronchi, pulmonary arteries, and lymphatic vessels. It extends from the hila to the lung periphery. [Fleischner Society]",,
RID28525,tension pneumothorax,"Pathophysiology.—Pneumothorax refers to the presence of gas in the pleural space. Qualifiers include spontaneous, traumatic, diagnostic, and tension. Tension pneumothorax is the accumulation of intrapleural gas under pressure. In this situation, the ipsilateral lung will, if normal, collapse completely; however, a less than normally compliant lung may remain partially inflated. 
Radiographs and CT scans.—On chest radiographs, a visceral pleural edge is visible (Fig 55) unless the pneumothorax is very small or the pleural edge is not tangential to the x-ray beam. Tension pneumothorax may be associated with considerable shift of the mediastinum and/or depression of the hemidiaphragm. Some shift can occur without tension because the pleural pressure in the presence of pneumothorax becomes atmospheric, while the pleural pressure in the contralateral hemithorax remains negative.  [Fleischner Society]",,
RID28528,traction bronchiectasis,CT scans.—Traction bronchiectasis and traction bronchiolectasis respectively represent irregular bronchial and bronchiolar dilatation caused by surrounding retractile pulmonary fibrosis (130). Dilated airways are usually identifiable as such (Fig 69) but may be seen as cysts (bronchi) or microcysts (bronchioles in the lung periphery). The juxtaposition of numerous cystic airways may make the distinction from “pure” fibrotic honeycombing difficult. [Fleischner Society],,
RID28529,traction bronchiolectasis,CT scans.—Traction bronchiectasis and traction bronchiolectasis respectively represent irregular bronchial and bronchiolar dilatation caused by surrounding retractile pulmonary fibrosis (130). Dilated airways are usually identifiable as such (Fig 69) but may be seen as cysts (bronchi) or microcysts (bronchioles in the lung periphery). The juxtaposition of numerous cystic airways may make the distinction from “pure” fibrotic honeycombing difficult. [Fleischner Society],,
RID28530,opacity,"Radiographs and CT scans.—Opacity refers to any area that preferentially attenuates the x-ray beam and therefore appears more opaque than the surrounding area. It is a nonspecific term that does not indicate the size or pathologic nature of the abnormality. (See also parenchymal opacification, ground-glass opacity.) [Fleischner Society]",,
RID28531,ground-glass opacity,"Radiographs and CT scans.—On chest radiographs, ground-glass opacity appears as an area of hazy increased lung opacity, usually extensive, within which margins of pulmonary vessels may be indistinct. On CT scans, it appears as hazy increased opacity of lung, with preservation of bronchial and vascular margins (Fig 23). It is caused by partial filling of airspaces, interstitial thickening (due to fluid, cells, and/or fibrosis), partial collapse of alveoli, increased capillary blood volume, or a combination of these, the common factor being the partial displacement of air (59,60). Ground-glass opacity is less opaque than consolidation, in which bronchovascular margins are obscured. (See also consolidation.) [Fleischner Society]",ground glass; ground glass attenuation; ground glass opacity; ground-glass,
RID28532,parenchymal band,"Radiographs and CT scans.—A parenchymal band is a linear opacity, usually 1–3 mm thick and up to 5 cm long that usually extends to the visceral pleura (which is often thickened and may be retracted at the site of contact) (Fig 48). It reflects pleuroparenchymal fibrosis and is usually associated with distortion of the lung architecture. Parenchymal bands are most frequently encountered in individuals who have been exposed to asbestos (100,101).  [Fleischner Society]",,
RID28533,parenchymal opacification,"Radiographs and CT scans.—Parenchymal opacification of the lungs may or may not obscure the margins of vessels and airway walls (45). Consolidation indicates that definition of these margins (excepting air bronchograms) is lost within the dense opacification, whereas ground-glass opacity indicates a smaller increase in attenuation, in which the definition of underlying structures is preserved (59). The more specific terms consolidation and ground-glass opacity are preferred. (See also consolidation, ground-glass opacity.) [Fleischner Society]",,
RID28534,pseudoplaque,"CT scans.—A pseudoplaque is a pulmonary opacity contiguous with the visceral pleura formed by coalescent small nodules. It simulates the appearance of a pleural plaque. This entity is encountered most commonly in sarcoidosis (Fig 58), silicosis, and coal-worker's pneumoconiosis (86).  [Fleischner Society]",,
RID28537,air trapping,"Pathophysiology.—Air trapping is retention of air in the lung distal to an obstruction (usually partial). 
CT scans.—Air trapping is seen on end-expiration CT scans as parenchymal areas with less than normal increase in attenuation and lack of volume reduction. Comparison between inspiratory and expiratory CT scans can be helpful when air trapping is subtle or diffuse (11,12) (Fig 4). Differentiation from areas of decreased attenuation resulting from hypoperfusion as a consequence of an occlusive vascular disorder (eg, chronic thromboembolism) may be problematic (13), but other findings of airways versus vascular disease are usually present. (See also mosaic attenuation pattern.)  [Fleischner Society]",gas trapping,
RID28538,airspace,"Anatomy.—An airspace is the gas-containing part of the lung, including the respiratory bronchioles but excluding purely conducting airways, such as terminal bronchioles. 
Radiographs and CT scans.—This term is used in conjunction with consolidation, opacity, and nodules to designate the filling of airspaces with the products of disease (14).  [Fleischner Society]",,
RID28539,acinus,A structural unit of the lung distal to a terminal bronbronchiole and is supplied by first-order respiratory bronchioles; it contains alveolar ducts and alveoli. It is the largest unit in which all airways participate in gas exchange and is approximately 6–10 mm in diameter. [Fleischner Society],,

RID28836,idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis,"Pathology.—Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a specific form of chronic fibrosing interstitial pneumonia of unknown cause and is characterized by a histologic pattern of usual interstitial pneumonia (5,64). 
Radiographs and CT scans.—The typical imaging findings are reticular opacities and honeycombing, with a predominantly peripheral and basal distribution (Fig 26). Ground-glass opacity, if present, is less extensive than reticular and honeycombing patterns. The typical radiologic findings (65,66) are also encountered in usual interstitial pneumonia secondary to specific causes, such as asbestos-induced pulmonary fibrosis (asbestosis), and the diagnosis is usually one of exclusion. (See also usual interstitial pneumonia.)  [Fleischner Society]",,
RID28837,intralobular lines,"CT scans.—Intralobular lines are visible as fine linear opacities in a lobule when the intralobular interstitial tissue is abnormally thickened (Fig 31).

Common sites are the shoulder capsule, hip capsule, hamstring muscles, and Achilles tendon. The tendon sheaths become inflamed and painful, and accumulate fluid. Joint mobility is usually reduced. Friction rubs may be felt or heard (with a stethoscope) on movement. Calcium deposits may occur in the tendon and its sheath, leading to opacities on radiographs of the affected area.

RID3652,fibromyalgia,"A common nonarticular rheumatic syndrome characterized by myalgia and multiple points of focal muscle tenderness to palpation (trigger points). Muscle pain is typically aggravated by inactivity or exposure to cold. This condition is often associated with general symptoms, such as sleep disturbances, fatigue, stiffness, headaches, and occasionally depression. There is significant overlap between fibromyalgia and the chronic fatigue syndrome (fatigue syndrome, chronic). Fibromyalgia may arise as a primary or secondary disease process. It is most frequent in females aged 20 to 50 years. (From Adams et al., Principles of Neurology, 6th ed, p1494-95) [MeSH]",,

Local recurrences and distant metastases many years after treatment are common. This tumor appears in all age groups and is most common in women.

It accounts for approximately 2% of intracranial tumors, arising most frequently in the cerebellar hemispheres and vermis. Histologically, the tumors are composed of multiple capillary and sinusoidal channels lined with endothelial cells and clusters of lipid-laden pseudoxanthoma cells. Usually solitary, these tumors can be multiple and may also occur in the brain stem, spinal cord, retina, and supratentorial compartment. Cerebellar hemangioblastomas usually present in the third decade with intracranial hypertension, and ataxia.

Port-wine stains vary in color from fairly pale pink to deep red or purple and in size from a few millimeters to many centimeters in diameter. The face is the most frequently affected site and they are most often unilateral. (From Rook et al., Textbook of Dermatology, 5th ed, p483) [MeSH]",cavernous hemangioma; cavernous malformation,

RID3995,hemangioblastoma,"A benign tumor of the nervous system that may occur sporadically or in association with hippel-lindau disease. It accounts for approximately 2% of intracranial tumors, arising most frequently in the cerebellar hemispheres and vermis. Histologically, the tumors are composed of multiple capillary and sinusoidal channels lined with endothelial cells and clusters of lipid-laden pseudoxanthoma cells. Usually solitary, these tumors can be multiple and may also occur in the brain stem, spinal cord, retina, and supratentorial compartment. Cerebellar hemangioblastomas usually present in the third decade with intracranial hypertension, and ataxia.

RID3999,Kaposi sarcoma,"A multicentric, malignant neoplastic vascular proliferation characterized by the development of bluish-red cutaneous nodules, usually on the lower extremities, most often on the toes or feet, and slowly increasing in size and number and spreading to more proximal areas. The tumors have endothelium-lined channels and vascular spaces admixed with variably sized aggregates of spindle-shaped cells, and often remain confined to the skin and subcutaneous tissue, but widespread visceral involvement may occur. Kaposi's sarcoma occurs spontaneously in Jewish and Italian males in Europe and the United States. An aggressive variant in young children is endemic in some areas of Africa. A third form occurs in about 0.04% of kidney transplant patients. There is also a high incidence in aids patients.

RID4050,ependymal tumor,"Glioma derived from ependymocytes that tend to present as malignant intracranial tumors in children and as benign intraspinal neoplasms in adults. It may arise from any level of the ventricular system or central canal of the spinal cord. Intracranial ependymomas most frequently originate in the fourth ventricle and histologically are densely cellular tumors which may contain ependymal tubules and perivascular pseudorosettes. Spinal ependymomas are usually benign papillary or myxopapillary tumors.

Histologically, these tumors are encapsulated, relatively avascular, and tend to form cysts and microcalcifications. Neoplastic cells tend to have small round nuclei surrounded by unstained nuclei. The tumors may vary from well-differentiated to highly anaplastic forms.

RID4227,adenoid cystic carcinoma,"Carcinoma characterized by bands or cylinders of hyalinized or mucinous stroma separating or surrounded by nests or cords of small epithelial cells. When the cylinders occur within masses of epithelial cells, they give the tissue a perforated, sievelike, or cribriform appearance. Such tumors occur in the mammary glands, the mucous glands of the upper and lower respiratory tract, and the salivary glands. They are malignant but slow-growing, and tend to spread locally via the nerves. (Dorland, 27th ed) [MeSH]",,

CT scans.—This pattern is characterized by distribution along the structures that border the pulmonary lobules (ie, interlobular septa, visceral pleura, and vessels) (102). The term is most frequently used in the context of diseases (eg, perilobular organizing pneumonia) that are distributed mainly around the inner surface of the secondary pulmonary lobule (103) (Fig 49).

They have been described in patients with adenocarcinoma (Fig 57), bronchioloalveolar carcinoma (111), and benign conditions such as infectious pneumonia.",,
RID43271,reticular pattern,"On chest radiographs, a reticular pattern is a collection of innumerable small linear opacities that, by summation, produce an ppearance resembling a net (synonym: reticulation) (Fig 61). This finding usually represents interstitial lung disease. The constituents of a reticular pattern are more clearly seen at thinsection CT, whether they are interlobular septal thickening, intralobular lines, or the cyst walls of honeycombing.

should not be considered synonymous. See also honeycombing.)",reticular enhancement,
RID43272,reticulonodular pattern,"[Fleischner Society] A combined reticular and nodular pattern, the reticulonodular pattern is usually the result of the summation of points of intersection of innumerable lines, creating the effect on chest radiographs of superimposed micronodules (Fig 62). The dimension of the nodules depends on the size and number of linear or curvilinear elements. (See also reticular pattern.) On CT scans, the pattern appears as a concurrence of reticular and micronodular patterns. The micronodules can be situated in the center of the reticular elements (eg, centrilobular micronodules) or superimposed on the linear opacities (eg, septal micronodules).",,
RID43274,Kerley A lines,These are longer (at least 2cm and up to 6cm) unbranching lines coursing diagonally from the hila out to the periphery of the lungs.

Kerley A lines are never seen without Kerley B or C lines also present.,,
RID43276,Kerley C lines,"These are the least commonly seen of the Kerley lines. They are short, fine lines throughout the lungs, with a reticular appearance. They may represent thickening of anastomotic lymphatics or superimposition of many Kerley B lines.",,

The positioning involved in views is designed to permit visualization of specific anatomic targets or particular orientations (e.g. open mouth odontoid view, Norgaard view, swimmer’s view).  Note that this positioning is usually not passive in the strict sense (i.e. performed by someone else), but rather passive in the sense that it is neither onerous for the patient, nor intended as a challenge to the patient.

The acute phase is characterized by edema and hyaline membrane formation. The later phase is characterized by airspace and/or interstitial organization (5). The histologic pattern is indistinguishable from that of acute respiratory distress syndrome. 
Radiographs and CT scans.—In the acute phase, patchy bilateral ground-glass opacities are seen (6), often with some sparing of individual lobules, producing a geographic appearance; dense opacification is seen in the dependent lung (Fig 1). In the organizing phase, architectural distortion, traction bronchiectasis, cysts, and reticular opacities are seen (7).  [Fleischner Society]",,AIP
RID5331,desquamative interstitial pneumonia,"Pathology.—Histologically, DIP is characterized by the widespread accumulation of an excess of macrophages in the distal airspaces. The macrophages are uniformly distributed, unlike in respiratory bronchiolitis–interstitial lung disease, in which the disease is conspicuously bronchiolocentric. Interstitial involvement is minimal. Most cases of DIP are related to cigarette smoking, but a few are idiopathic or associated with rare inborn errors of metabolism (5). 
Radiographs and CT scans.—Ground-glass opacity is the dominant abnormality and tends to have a basal and peripheral distribution (Fig 22). Microcystic or honeycomb changes in the area of ground-glass opacity are seen in some cases (55).  [Fleischner Society]",,DIP
RID5333,usual interstitial pneumonia,"Pathology.—UIP is a histologic pattern of pulmonary fibrosis characterized by temporal and spatial heterogeneity, with established fibrosis and honeycombing interspersed among normal lung. Fibroblastic foci with fibrotic destruction of lung architecture, often with honeycombing, are the key findings (5). The fibrosis is initially concentrated in the lung periphery. UIP is the pattern seen in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, but can be encountered in diseases of known cause (eg, some cases of chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis). 
Radiographs and CT scans.—Honeycombing with a basal and subpleural distribution (Fig 71) is regarded as pathognomonic (63,65), but not all cases of biopsy-proved UIP have this distinctive CT pattern.  [Fleischner Society]",,UIP
RID5341,nonspecific interstitial pneumonia,"Pathology.—NSIP is characterized by a histologic pattern of uniform interstitial involvement by varying degrees of chronic inflammation or fibrosis.

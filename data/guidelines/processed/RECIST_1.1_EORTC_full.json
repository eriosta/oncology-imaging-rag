Assessment of pathological lymph nodes is now incorporated: nodes\nwith a short axis of P15 mm are considered measurable and assessable as target lesions.\nThe short axis measurement should be included in the sum of lesions in calculation of\ntumour response. Nodes that shrink to <10 mm short axis are considered normal. Conﬁrma-\ntion of response is required for trials with response primary endpoint but is no longer\nrequired in randomised studies since the control arm serves as appropriate means of inter-\npretation of data. Disease progression is clariﬁed in several aspects: in addition to the previ-\nous deﬁnition of progression in target disease of 20% increase in sum, a 5 mm absolute\nincrease is now required as well to guard against over calling PD when the total sum is very\n0959-8049/$ - see front matter \u0002 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

All rights reserved.\n1.\nBackground\n1.1.\nHistory of RECIST criteria\nAssessment of the change in tumour burden is an important\nfeature of the clinical evaluation of cancer therapeutics. Both\ntumour shrinkage (objective response) and time to the devel-\nopment of disease progression are important endpoints in\ncancer clinical trials. The use of tumour regression as the\nendpoint for phase II trials screening new agents for evi-\ndence of anti-tumour effect is supported by years of evi-\ndence suggesting that, for many solid tumours, agents\nwhich produce tumour shrinkage in a proportion of patients\nhave a reasonable (albeit imperfect) chance of subsequently\ndemonstrating an improvement in overall survival or other\ntime to event measures in randomised phase III studies (re-\nviewed in [1–4]). At the current time objective response car-\nries with it a body of evidence greater than for any other\nbiomarker supporting its utility as a measure of promising\ntreatment effect in phase II screening trials. Furthermore,\nat both the phase II and phase III stage of drug development,\nclinical trials in advanced disease settings are increasingly\nutilising time to progression (or progression-free survival)\nas an endpoint upon which efﬁcacy conclusions are drawn,\nwhich is also based on anatomical measurement of tumour\nsize.\nHowever, both of these tumour endpoints, objective re-\nsponse and time to disease progression, are useful only if\nbased on widely accepted and readily applied standard crite-\nria based on anatomical tumour burden. In 1981 the World\nHealth Organisation (WHO) ﬁrst published tumour response\ncriteria, mainly for use in trials where tumour response was\nthe primary endpoint. The WHO criteria introduced the con-\ncept of an overall assessment of tumour burden by summing\nthe products of bidimensional lesion measurements and\ndetermined response to therapy by evaluation of change from\nbaseline while on treatment.5 However, in the decades that\nfollowed their publication, cooperative groups and pharma-\nceutical companies that used the WHO criteria often ‘modi-\nﬁed’ them to accommodate new technologies or to address\nareas that were unclear in the original document. This led\nto confusion in interpretation of trial results6 and in fact,\nthe application of varying response criteria was shown to lead\nto very different conclusions about the efﬁcacy of the same\nregimen.7 In response to these problems, an International\nWorking Party was formed in the mid 1990s to standardise\nand simplify response criteria. New criteria, known as RECIST\n(Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours), were pub-\nlished in 2000.8 Key features of the original RECIST include\ndeﬁnitions of minimum size of measurable lesions, instruc-\ntions on how many lesions to follow (up to 10; a maximum\nﬁve per organ site), and the use of unidimensional, rather\nthan bidimensional, measures for overall evaluation of tu-\nmour burden. These criteria have subsequently been widely\nadopted by academic institutions, cooperative groups, and\nindustry for trials where the primary endpoints are objective\nresponse or progression. In addition, regulatory authorities\naccept\nRECIST\nas\nan\nappropriate\nguideline\nfor\nthese\nassessments.\n1.2.\nWhy update RECIST?\nSince RECIST was published in 2000, many investigators have\nconﬁrmed in prospective analyses the validity of substituting\nunidimensional for bidimensional (and even three-dimen-\nsional)-based criteria (reviewed in [9]). With rare exceptions\n(e.g. mesothelioma), the use of unidimensional criteria seems\nto perform well in solid tumour phase II studies.\nHowever, a number of questions and issues have arisen\nwhich merit answers and further clarity. Amongst these\nare whether fewer than 10 lesions can be assessed without\naffecting the overall assigned response for patients (or the\nconclusion about activity in trials); how to apply RECIST in\nrandomised phase III trials where progression, not response,\nis the primary endpoint particularly if not all patients have\nmeasurable disease; whether or how to utilise newer imag-\ning technologies such as FDG-PET and MRI; how to handle\nassessment of lymph nodes; whether response conﬁrmation\nis truly needed; and, not least, the applicability of RECIST in\ntrials of targeted non-cytotoxic drugs. This revision of the\nRECIST guidelines includes updates that touch on all these\npoints.\nE U R O P E A N J O U R N A L O F C A N C E R 4 5 ( 2 0 0 9 ) 2 2 8 –2 4 7\n229",

      "text": "1.3.\nProcess of RECIST 1.1 development\nThe RECIST Working Group, consisting of clinicians with\nexpertise in early drug development from academic research\norganisations, government and industry, together with imag-\ning specialists and statisticians, has met regularly to set the\nagenda for an update to RECIST, determine the evidence\nneeded to justify the various changes made, and to review\nemerging evidence. A critical aspect of the revision process\nwas to create a database of prospectively documented solid\ntumour measurement data obtained from industry and aca-\ndemic group trials. This database, assembled at the EORTC\nData Centre under the leadership of Jan Bogaerts and Patrick\nTherasse (co-authors of this guideline), consists of >6500 pa-\ntients with >18,000 target lesions and was utilised to investi-\ngate the impact of a variety of questions (e.g. number of\ntarget lesions required, the need for response conﬁrmation,\nand lymph node measurement rules) on response and pro-\ngression-free survival outcomes. The results of this work,\nwhich after evaluation by the RECIST Working Group led to\nmost of the changes in this revised guideline, are reported\nin detail in a separate paper in this special issue.10 Larry Sch-\nwartz and Robert Ford (also co-authors of this guideline) also\nprovided key databases from which inferences have been\nmade that inform these revisions.11\nThe publication of this revised guideline is believed to be\ntimely since it incorporates changes to simplify, optimise\nand standardise the assessment of tumour burden in clinical\ntrials. A summary of key changes is found in Appendix I. Be-\ncause the fundamental approach to assessment remains\ngrounded in the anatomical, rather than functional, assess-\nment of disease, we have elected to name this version RECIST\n1.1, rather than 2.0.\n1.4.\nWhat about volumetric or functional assessment?\nThis raises the question, frequently posed, about whether it is\n‘time’ to move from anatomic unidimensional assessment of\ntumour burden to either volumetric anatomical assessment\nor to functional assessment (e.g. dynamic contrast enhanced\nMRI or CT or (18)F-ﬂuorodeoxyglucose positron emission\ntomographic (FDG-PET) techniques assessing tumour metab-\nolism). As can be seen, the Working Group and particularly\nthose involved in imaging research, did not believe that there\nis at present sufﬁcient standardisation and widespread avail-\nability to recommend adoption of these alternative assess-\nment methods. The only exception to this is in the use of\nFDG-PET imaging as an adjunct to determination of progres-\nsion, as described later in this guideline. As detailed in paper\nin this special issue12, we believe that the use of these prom-\nising newer approaches (which could either add to or substitute\nfor anatomical assessment as described in RECIST) requires\nappropriate and rigorous clinical validation studies. This pa-\nper by Sargent et al. illustrates the type of data that will be\nneeded to be able to deﬁne ‘endpoints’ for these modalities\nand how to determine where and when such criteria/modal-\nities can be used to improve the reliability with which truly\nactive new agents are identiﬁed and truly inactive new agents\nare discarded in comparison to RECIST criteria in phase II\nscreening trials. The RECIST Working Group looks forward\nto such data emerging in the next few years to allow the\nappropriate changes to the next iteration of the RECIST\ncriteria.\n2.\nPurpose of this guideline\nThis guideline describes a standard approach to solid tumour\nmeasurement and deﬁnitions for objective assessment of\nchange in tumour size for use in adult and paediatric cancer\nclinical trials. It is expected these criteria will be useful in all\ntrials where objective response is the primary study endpoint,\nas well as in trials where assessment of stable disease, tu-\nmour progression or time to progression analyses are under-\ntaken, since all of these outcome measures are based on an\nassessment of anatomical tumour burden and its change on\nstudy. There are no assumptions in this paper about the pro-\nportion of patients meeting the criteria for any of these end-\npoints which will signal that an agent or treatment regimen is\nactive: those deﬁnitions are dependent on type of cancer in\nwhich a trial is being undertaken and the speciﬁc agent(s) un-\nder study. Protocols must include appropriate statistical sec-\ntions which deﬁne the efﬁcacy parameters upon which the\ntrial sample size and decision criteria are based. In addition\nto providing deﬁnitions and criteria for assessment of tumour\nresponse,\nthis\nguideline\nalso\nmakes\nrecommendations\nregarding standard reporting of the results of trials that utilise\ntumour response as an endpoint.\nWhile these guidelines may be applied in malignant brain\ntumour studies, there are also separate criteria published for\nresponse assessment in that setting.13 This guideline is not in-\ntended for use for studies of malignant lymphoma since\ninternational guidelines for response assessment in lym-\nphoma are published separately.14\nFinally, many oncologists in their daily clinical practice fol-\nlow their patients’ malignant disease by means of repeated\nimaging studies and make decisions about continued therapy\non the basis of both objective and symptomatic criteria. It is\nnot intended that these RECIST guidelines play a role in that\ndecision making, except if determined appropriate by the\ntreating oncologist.\n3.\nMeasurability of tumour at baseline\n3.1.\nDeﬁnitions\nAt baseline, tumour lesions/lymph nodes will be categorised\nmeasurable or non-measurable as follows:\n3.1.1.\nMeasurable\nTumour lesions: Must be accurately measured in at least one\ndimension (longest diameter in the plane of measurement is\nto be recorded) with a minimum size of:\n• 10 mm by CT scan (CT scan slice thickness no greater than\n5 mm; see Appendix II on imaging guidance).\n• 10 mm caliper measurement by clinical exam (lesions\nwhich cannot be accurately measured with calipers should\nbe recorded as non-measurable).\n• 20 mm by chest X-ray.\n230\nE U R O P E A N J O U R N A L O F C A N C E R 4 5 ( 2 0 0 9 ) 2 2 8 –2 4 7",

How-\never,\nthese\ntechniques\ncan\nbe\nused\nto\nconﬁrm\nthe\npresence or disappearance of bone lesions.\n• Lytic bone lesions or mixed lytic-blastic lesions, with identi-\nﬁable soft tissue components, that can be evaluated by cross\nsectional imaging techniques such as CT or MRI can be con-\nsidered as measurable lesions if the soft tissue component\nmeets the deﬁnition of measurability described above.\n• Blastic bone lesions are non-measurable.\nCystic lesions:.\n• Lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically deﬁned\nsimple cysts should not be considered as malignant lesions\n(neither measurable nor non-measurable) since they are, by\ndeﬁnition, simple cysts.\n• ‘Cystic lesions’ thought to represent cystic metastases can\nbe considered as measurable lesions, if they meet the deﬁ-\nnition of measurability described above. However, if non-\ncystic lesions are present in the same patient, these are pre-\nferred for selection as target lesions.\nLesions with prior local treatment:.\n• Tumour lesions situated in a previously irradiated area, or\nin an area subjected to other loco-regional therapy, are usu-\nally not considered measurable unless there has been dem-\nonstrated progression in the lesion. Study protocols should\ndetail the conditions under which such lesions would be\nconsidered measurable.\n3.2.\nSpeciﬁcations by methods of measurements\n3.2.1.\nMeasurement of lesions\nAll measurements should be recorded in metric notation,\nusing calipers if clinically assessed. All baseline evaluations\nshould be performed as close as possible to the treatment\nstart and never more than 4 weeks before the beginning of\nthe treatment.\n3.2.2.\nMethod of assessment\nThe same method of assessment and the same technique\nshould be used to characterise each identiﬁed and reported\nlesion at baseline and during follow-up. Imaging based evalu-\nation should always be done rather than clinical examination\nunless the lesion(s) being followed cannot be imaged but are\nassessable by clinical exam.\nClinical lesions: Clinical lesions will only be considered mea-\nsurable when they are superﬁcial and P10 mm diameter as\nassessed using calipers (e.g. skin nodules). For the case of skin\nlesions, documentation by colour photography including a ru-\nler to estimate the size of the lesion is suggested. As noted\nabove, when lesions can be evaluated by both clinical exam\nand imaging, imaging evaluation should be undertaken since\nit is more objective and may also be reviewed at the end of the\nstudy.\nChest X-ray: Chest CT is preferred over chest X-ray, particu-\nlarly when progression is an important endpoint, since CT is\nmore sensitive than X-ray, particularly in identifying new le-\nsions. However, lesions on chest X-ray may be considered\nmeasurable if they are clearly deﬁned and surrounded by aer-\nated lung. See Appendix II for more details.\nCT, MRI: CT is the best currently available and reproducible\nmethod to measure lesions selected for response assessment.\nThis guideline has deﬁned measurability of lesions on CT\nscan based on the assumption that CT slice thickness is\n5 mm or less. As is described in Appendix II, when CT scans\nhave slice thickness greater than 5 mm, the minimum size\nfor a measurable lesion should be twice the slice thickness.\nMRI is also acceptable in certain situations (e.g. for body\nscans). More details concerning the use of both CT and MRI\nfor assessment of objective tumour response evaluation are\nprovided in Appendix II.\nUltrasound: Ultrasound is not useful in assessment of lesion\nsize and should not be used as a method of measurement.\nUltrasound examinations cannot be reproduced in their en-\ntirety for independent review at a later date and, because\nthey are operator dependent, it cannot be guaranteed that\nthe same technique and measurements will be taken from\none assessment to the next (described in greater detail in\nAppendix II). If new lesions are identiﬁed by ultrasound in\nthe course of the study, conﬁrmation by CT or MRI is ad-\nvised. If there is concern about radiation exposure at CT,\nMRI may be used instead of CT in selected instances.\nEndoscopy, laparoscopy: The utilisation of these techniques for\nobjective tumour evaluation is not advised. However, they\ncan be useful to conﬁrm complete pathological response\nwhen biopsies are obtained or to determine relapse in trials\nwhere recurrence following complete response or surgical\nresection is an endpoint.\nTumour markers: Tumour markers alone cannot be used to as-\nsess objective tumour response.

Because\ntumour markers are disease speciﬁc, instructions for their\nmeasurement should be incorporated into protocols on a\ndisease speciﬁc basis. Speciﬁc guidelines for both CA-125\nresponse (in recurrent ovarian cancer) and PSA response (in\nrecurrent prostate cancer), have been published.16–18 In addi-\ntion, the Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup has developed CA125\nprogression criteria which are to be integrated with objective\ntumour assessment for use in ﬁrst-line trials in ovarian\ncancer.19\nCytology, histology: These techniques can be used to differenti-\nate between PR and CR in rare cases if required by protocol\n(for example, residual lesions in tumour types such as germ\ncell tumours, where known residual benign tumours can re-\nmain). When effusions are known to be a potential adverse\neffect of treatment (e.g. with certain taxane compounds or\nangiogenesis inhibitors), the cytological conﬁrmation of the\nneoplastic origin of any effusion that appears or worsens dur-\ning treatment can be considered if the measurable tumour\nhas met criteria for response or stable disease in order to dif-\nferentiate between response (or stable disease) and progres-\nsive disease.\n4.\nTumour response evaluation\n4.1.\nAssessment of overall tumour burden and\nmeasurable disease\nTo assess objective response or future progression, it is nec-\nessary to estimate the overall tumour burden at baseline and\nuse this as a comparator for subsequent measurements.\nOnly patients with measurable disease at baseline should\nbe included in protocols where objective tumour response\nis the primary endpoint. Measurable disease is deﬁned by\nthe presence of at least one measurable lesion (as detailed\nabove in Section 3). In studies where the primary endpoint\nis tumour progression (either time to progression or propor-\ntion with progression at a ﬁxed date), the protocol must\nspecify if entry is restricted to those with measurable disease\nor whether patients having non-measurable disease only are\nalso eligible.\n4.2.\nBaseline documentation of ‘target’ and ‘non-target’\nlesions\nWhen more than one measurable lesion is present at baseline\nall lesions up to a maximum of ﬁve lesions total (and a max-\nimum of two lesions per organ) representative of all involved\norgans should be identiﬁed as target lesions and will be re-\ncorded and measured at baseline (this means in instances\nwhere patients have only one or two organ sites involved a\nmaximum of two and four lesions respectively will be re-\ncorded). For evidence to support the selection of only ﬁve tar-\nget lesions, see analyses on a large prospective database in\nthe article by Bogaerts et al.10.\nTarget lesions should be selected on the basis of their size\n(lesions with the longest diameter), be representative of all in-\nvolved organs, but in addition should be those that lend\nthemselves to reproducible repeated measurements. It may be\nthe case that, on occasion, the largest lesion does not lend it-\nself to reproducible measurement in which circumstance the\nnext largest lesion which can be measured reproducibly\nshould be selected. To illustrate this point see the example\nin Fig. 3 of Appendix II.\nLymph nodes merit special mention since they are normal\nanatomical structures which may be visible by imaging even\nif not involved by tumour. As noted in Section 3, pathological\nnodes which are deﬁned as measurable and may be identi-\nﬁed as target lesions must meet the criterion of a short axis\nof P15 mm by CT scan. Only the short axis of these nodes\nwill contribute to the baseline sum. The short axis of the\nnode is the diameter normally used by radiologists to judge\nif a node is involved by solid tumour. Nodal size is normally\nreported as two dimensions in the plane in which the image\nis obtained (for CT scan this is almost always the axial plane;\nfor MRI the plane of acquisition may be axial, saggital or\ncoronal). The smaller of these measures is the short axis.\nFor example, an abdominal node which is reported as being\n20 mm · 30 mm has a short axis of 20 mm and qualiﬁes as a\nmalignant, measurable node. In this example, 20 mm should\nbe recorded as the node measurement (See also the example\nin Fig. 4 in Appendix II). All other pathological nodes (those\nwith short axis P10 mm but <15 mm) should be considered\nnon-target lesions. Nodes that have a short axis <10 mm\nare considered non-pathological and should not be recorded\nor followed.\nA sum of the diameters (longest for non-nodal lesions, short\naxis for nodal lesions) for all target lesions will be calculated\nand reported as the baseline sum diameters. If lymph nodes\nare to be included in the sum, then as noted above, only the\nshort axis is added into the sum. The baseline sum diameters\nwill be used as reference to further characterise any objective\ntumour regression in the measurable dimension of the\ndisease.\nAll other lesions (or sites of disease) including pathological\nlymph nodes should be identiﬁed as non-target lesions and\nshould also be recorded at baseline. Measurements are not re-\nquired and these lesions should be followed as ‘present’, ‘ab-\nsent’, or in rare cases ‘unequivocal progression’ (more details\nto follow). In addition, it is possible to record multiple non-\ntarget lesions involving the same organ as a single item on\nthe case record form (e.g. ‘multiple enlarged pelvic lymph\nnodes’ or ‘multiple liver metastases’).\n4.3.\nResponse criteria\nThis section provides the deﬁnitions of the criteria used to\ndetermine objective tumour response for target lesions.\n4.3.1.\nEvaluation of target lesions\nComplete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions.\nAny pathological lymph nodes (whether target or\nnon-target) must have reduction in short axis to\n<10 mm.\nPartial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of\ndiameters of target lesions, taking as reference the\nbaseline sum diameters.\n232\nE U R O P E A N J O U R N A L O F C A N C E R 4 5 ( 2 0 0 9 ) 2 2 8 –2 4 7",

In addition to\nthe relative increase of 20%, the sum must also dem-\nonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. (Note:\nthe appearance of one or more new lesions is also\nconsidered progression).\nStable Disease (SD): Neither sufﬁcient shrinkage to qualify for\nPR nor sufﬁcient increase to qualify for PD, taking as\nreference the smallest sum diameters while on study.\n4.3.2.\nSpecial notes on the assessment of target lesions\nLymph nodes. Lymph nodes identiﬁed as target lesions should\nalways have the actual short axis measurement recorded (mea-\nsured in the same anatomical plane as the baseline examina-\ntion), even if the nodes regress to below 10 mm on study. This\nmeans that when lymph nodes are included as target lesions,\nthe ‘sum’ of lesions may not be zero even if complete response\ncriteria are met, since a normal lymph node is deﬁned as having\na short axis of <10 mm. Case report forms or other data collec-\ntion methods may therefore be designed to have target nodal le-\nsions recorded in a separate section where, in order to qualify\nfor CR, each node must achieve a short axis <10 mm. For PR,\nSD and PD, the actual short axis measurement of the nodes is\nto be included in the sum of target lesions.\nTarget lesions that become ‘too small to measure’. While on\nstudy, all lesions (nodal and non-nodal) recorded at baseline\nshould have their actual measurements recorded at each sub-\nsequent evaluation, even when very small (e.g. 2 mm). How-\never, sometimes lesions or lymph nodes which are recorded\nas target lesions at baseline become so faint on CT scan that\nthe radiologist may not feel comfortable assigning an exact\nmeasure and may report them as being ‘too small to measure’.\nWhen this occurs it is important that a value be recorded on\nthe case report form. If it is the opinion of the radiologist that\nthe lesion has likely disappeared, the measurement should be\nrecorded as 0 mm. If the lesion is believed to be present and is\nfaintly seen but too small to measure, a default value of 5 mm\nshould be assigned (Note: It is less likely that this rule will be\nused for lymph nodes since they usually have a deﬁnable size\nwhen normal and are frequently surrounded by fat such as in\nthe retroperitoneum; however, if a lymph node is believed to\nbe present and is faintly seen but too small to measure, a de-\nfault value of 5 mm should be assigned in this circumstance as\nwell). This default value is derived from the 5 mm CT slice\nthickness (but should not be changed with varying CT slice\nthickness). The measurement of these lesions is potentially\nnon-reproducible, therefore providing this default value will\nprevent false responses or progressions based upon measure-\nment error. To reiterate, however, if the radiologist is able to\nprovide an actual measure, that should be recorded, even if\nit is below 5 mm.\nLesions that split or coalesce on treatment. As noted in Appen-\ndix II, when non-nodal lesions ‘fragment’, the longest diame-\nters of the fragmented portions should be added together to\ncalculate the target lesion sum. Similarly, as lesions coalesce,\na plane between them may be maintained that would aid in\nobtaining maximal diameter measurements of each individ-\nual lesion. If the lesions have truly coalesced such that they\nare no longer separable, the vector of the longest diameter\nin this instance should be the maximal longest diameter for\nthe ‘coalesced lesion’.\n4.3.3.\nEvaluation of non-target lesions\nThissection provides the deﬁnitionsofthe criteriausedtodeter-\nmine the tumour response for the group of non-target lesions.\nWhile some non-target lesions may actually be measurable,\nthey need not be measured and instead should be assessed only\nqualitatively at the time points speciﬁed in the protocol.\nComplete Response (CR): Disappearance of all non-target le-\nsions and normalisation of tumour marker level. All\nlymph nodes must be non-pathological in size\n(<10 mm short axis).\nNon-CR/Non-PD: Persistence of one or more non-target le-\nsion(s) and/or maintenance of tumour marker level\nabove the normal limits.\nProgressive Disease (PD): Unequivocal progression (see com-\nments below) of existing non-target lesions. (Note:\nthe appearance of one or more new lesions is also\nconsidered progression).\n4.3.4.\nSpecial notes on assessment of progression of non-\ntarget disease\nThe concept of progression of non-target disease requires\nadditional explanation as follows:\nWhen the patient also has measurable disease. In this setting,\nto achieve ‘unequivocal progression’ on the basis of the\nnon-target disease, there must be an overall level of substan-\ntial worsening in non-target disease such that, even in pres-\nence of SD or PR in target disease, the overall tumour\nburden has increased sufﬁciently to merit discontinuation\nof therapy (see examples in Appendix II and further details\nbelow). A modest ‘increase’ in the size of one or more non-tar-\nget lesions is usually not sufﬁcient to quality for unequivocal\nprogression status. The designation of overall progression so-\nlely on the basis of change in non-target disease in the face of\nSD or PR of target disease will therefore be extremely rare.\nWhen the patient has only non-measurable disease.This circum-\nstance arises in some phase III trials when it is not a criterion of\nstudy entry to have measurable disease. The same general con-\ncepts apply here as noted above, however, in this instance there\nis no measurable disease assessment to factor into the inter-\npretation of an increase in non-measurable disease burden.\nBecause worsening in non-target disease cannot be easily\nquantiﬁed (by deﬁnition: if all lesions are truly non-measur-\nable) a useful test that can be applied when assessing patients\nfor unequivocal progression is to consider if the increase in\noverall disease burden based on the change in non-measurable\ndisease is comparable in magnitude to the increase that would\nberequiredtodeclarePDformeasurabledisease: i.e.anincrease\nin tumour burden representing an additional 73% increase in\n‘volume’ (which is equivalent to a 20% increase diameter in a\nmeasurable lesion).

Some\nillustrative examples are shown in Figs. 5 and 6 in Appendix II.\nIf ‘unequivocal progression’ is seen, the patient should be con-\nsidered to have had overall PD at that point. While it would be\nideal to have objective criteria to apply to non-measurable dis-\nease, the very nature of that disease makes it impossible to do\nso, therefore the increase must be substantial.\n4.3.5.\nNew lesions\nThe appearance of new malignant lesions denotes disease\nprogression; therefore, some comments on detection of new\nlesions are important. There are no speciﬁc criteria for the\nidentiﬁcation of new radiographic lesions; however, the ﬁnd-\ning of a new lesion should be unequivocal: i.e. not attributable\nto differences in scanning technique, change in imaging\nmodality or ﬁndings thought to represent something other\nthan tumour (for example, some ‘new’ bone lesions may be\nsimply healing or ﬂare of pre-existing lesions). This is partic-\nularly important when the patient’s baseline lesions show\npartial or complete response. For example, necrosis of a liver\nlesion may be reported on a CT scan report as a ‘new’ cystic\nlesion, which it is not.\nA lesion identiﬁed on a follow-up study in an anatomical\nlocation that was not scanned at baseline is considered a new\nlesion andwill indicate diseaseprogression. An example of this\nis the patient who has visceral disease at baseline and while on\nstudy has a CTor MRI brain ordered which reveals metastases.\nThe patient’s brain metastases are considered to be evidence of\nPD even if he/she did not have brain imaging at baseline.\nIf a new lesion is equivocal, for example because of its\nsmall size, continued therapy and follow-up evaluation will\nclarify if it represents truly new disease. If repeat scans con-\nﬁrm there is deﬁnitely a new lesion, then progression should\nbe declared using the date of the initial scan.\nWhile FDG-PET response assessments need additional\nstudy, it is sometimes reasonable to incorporate the use of\nFDG-PET scanning to complement CT scanning in assessment\nof progression (particularly possible ‘new’ disease). New le-\nsions on the basis of FDG-PET imaging can be identiﬁed\naccording to the following algorithm:\na. Negative FDG-PET at baseline, with a positivel FDG-PET\nat follow-up is a sign of PD based on a new lesion.\nb. No FDG-PET at baseline and a positive FDG-PET at fol-\nlow-up:\nIf the positive FDG-PET at follow-up corresponds to a\nnew site of disease conﬁrmed by CT, this is PD.\nIf the positive FDG-PET at follow-up is not conﬁrmed as\na new site of disease on CT, additional follow-up CT\nscans are needed to determine if there is truly progres-\nsion occurring at that site (if so, the date of PD will be\nthe date of the initial abnormal FDG-PET scan).\nIf the positive FDG-PET at follow-up corresponds to a\npre-existing site of disease on CT that is not progress-\ning on the basis of the anatomic images, this is not PD.\n4.4.\nEvaluation of best overall response\nThe best overall response is the best response recorded from\nthe start of the study treatment until the end of treatment\ntaking into account any requirement for conﬁrmation. On oc-\ncasion a response may not be documented until after the end\nof therapy so protocols should be clear if post-treatment\nassessments are to be considered in determination of best\noverall response. Protocols must specify how any new therapy\nintroduced before progression will affect best response desig-\nnation. The patient’s best overall response assignment will\ndepend on the ﬁndings of both target and non-target disease\nand will also take into consideration the appearance of new\nlesions. Furthermore, depending on the nature of the study\nand the protocol requirements, it may also require conﬁrma-\ntory measurement (see Section 4.6). Speciﬁcally, in non-ran-\ndomised trials where response is the primary endpoint,\nconﬁrmation of PR or CR is needed to deem either one the\n‘best overall response’. This is described further below.\n4.4.1.\nTime point response\nIt is assumed that at each protocol speciﬁed time point, a re-\nsponse assessment occurs. Table 1 on the next page provides\na summary of the overall response status calculation at each\ntime point for patients who have measurable disease at\nbaseline.\nWhen patients have non-measurable (therefore non-tar-\nget) disease only, Table 2 is to be used.\n4.4.2.\nMissing assessments and inevaluable designation\nWhen no imaging/measurement is done at all at a particular\ntime point, the patient is not evaluable (NE) at that time point.\nIf only a subset of lesion measurements are made at an\nassessment, usually the case is also considered NE at that\ntime point, unless a convincing argument can be made that\nthe contribution of the individual missing lesion(s) would\nnot change the assigned time point response. This would be\nmost likely to happen in the case of PD. For example, if a pa-\ntient had a baseline sum of 50 mm with three measured le-\nsions and at follow-up only two lesions were assessed, but\nthose gave a sum of 80 mm, the patient will have achieved\nPD status, regardless of the contribution of the missing lesion.\n4.4.3.\nBest overall response: all time points\nThe best overall response is determined once all the data for the\npatient is known.\nBest response determination in trials where conﬁrmation of com-\nplete or partial response IS NOT required: Best response in these\ntrials is deﬁned as the best response across all time points (for\nexample, a patient who has SD at ﬁrst assessment, PR at sec-\nond assessment, and PD on last assessment has a best overall\nresponse of PR). When SD is believed to be best response, it\nmust also meet the protocol speciﬁed minimum time from\nbaseline. If the minimum time is not met when SD is other-\nwise the best time point response, the patient’s best response\ndepends on the subsequent assessments. For example, a pa-\ntient who has SD at ﬁrst assessment, PD at second and does\nnot meet minimum duration for SD, will have a best response\nof PD. The same patient lost to follow-up after the ﬁrst SD\nassessment would be considered inevaluable.\nl A ‘positive’ FDG-PET scan lesion means one which is FDG avid\nwith an uptake greater than twice that of the surrounding tissue\non the attenuation corrected image.\n234\nE U R O P E A N J O U R N A L O F C A N C E R 4 5 ( 2 0 0 9 ) 2 2 8 –2 4 7",

FDG-PET may be used to upgrade a response to a CR\nin a manner similar to a biopsy in cases where a residual\nradiographic abnormality is thought to represent ﬁbrosis or\nscarring. The use of FDG-PET in this circumstance should be\nprospectively described in the protocol and supported by dis-\nease speciﬁc medical literature for the indication. However, it\nmust be acknowledged that both approaches may lead to\nfalse positive CR due to limitations of FDG-PETand biopsy res-\nolution/sensitivity.\nFor equivocal ﬁndings of progression (e.g. very small and\nuncertain new lesions; cystic changes or necrosis in existing\nlesions), treatment may continue until the next scheduled\nassessment.

However, in the context of phase II studies\nwhere the beneﬁcial effect of therapy is not known, follow-up\nevery 6–8 weeks (timed to coincide with the end of a cycle) is\nreasonable. Smaller or greater time intervals than these could\nbe justiﬁed in speciﬁc regimens or circumstances. The proto-\ncol should specify which organ sites are to be evaluated at\nbaseline (usually those most likely to be involved with meta-\nstatic disease for the tumour type under study) and how often\nevaluations are repeated. Normally, all target and non-target\nsites are evaluated at each assessment. In selected circum-\nstances certain non-target organs may be evaluated less fre-\nquently. For example, bone scans may need to be repeated\nonly when complete response is identiﬁed in target disease\nor when progression in bone is suspected.\nAfter the end of the treatment, the need for repetitive tu-\nmour evaluations depends on whether the trial has as a goal\nthe response rate or the time to an event (progression/death).\nIf ‘time to an event’ (e.g. time to progression, disease-free\nsurvival, progression-free survival) is the main endpoint of\nthe study, then routine scheduled re-evaluation of protocol\nspeciﬁed sites of disease is warranted. In randomised com-\nparative trials in particular, the scheduled assessments\nshould be performed as identiﬁed on a calendar schedule\n(for example: every 6–8 weeks on treatment or every 3–4\nmonths after treatment) and should not be affected by delays\nin therapy, drug holidays or any other events that might lead\nto imbalance in a treatment arm in the timing of disease\nassessment.\n4.6.\nConﬁrmatory measurement/duration of response\n4.6.1.\nConﬁrmation\nIn non-randomised trials where response is the primary end-\npoint, conﬁrmation of PR and CR is required to ensure re-\nsponses identiﬁed are not the result of measurement error.\nThis will also permit appropriate interpretation of results in\nthe context of historical data where response has traditionally\nrequired conﬁrmation in such trials (see the paper by Bogaerts\net al. in this Special Issue10). However, in all other circum-\nstances, i.e. in randomised trials (phase II or III) or studies\nwhere stable disease or progression are the primary endpoints,\nconﬁrmation ofresponseis notrequiredsince itwillnotaddva-\nlue to theinterpretationoftrial results.However, eliminationof\nthe requirement for response conﬁrmation may increase the\nimportance of central review to protect against bias, in partic-\nular in studies which are not blinded.\nIn the case of SD, measurements must have met the SD\ncriteria at least once after study entry at a minimum interval\n(in general not less than 6–8 weeks) that is deﬁned in the\nstudy protocol.\n4.6.2.\nDuration of overall response\nThe duration of overall response is measured from the time\nmeasurement criteria are ﬁrst met for CR/PR (whichever is ﬁrst\nrecorded) until the ﬁrst date that recurrent or progressive dis-\nease is objectively documented (taking as reference for progres-\nsive disease the smallest measurements recorded on study).\nThe duration of overall complete response is measured\nfrom the time measurement criteria are ﬁrst met for CR until\nthe ﬁrst date that recurrent disease is objectively documented.\n4.6.3.\nDuration of stable disease\nStable disease is measured from the start of the treatment (in\nrandomised trials, from date of randomisation) until the crite-\nria for progression are met, taking as reference the smallest\nsum on study (if the baseline sum is the smallest, this is the\nreference for calculation of PD).\nThe clinical relevance of the duration of stable disease var-\nies in different studies and diseases. If the proportion of pa-\ntients achieving stable disease for a minimum period of time\nis an endpoint of importance in a particular trial, the protocol\nshould specify the minimal time interval required between\ntwo measurements for determination of stable disease.\nNote: The duration of response and stable disease as well as\ntheprogression-free survivalareinﬂuencedby thefrequencyof\nfollow-up after baseline evaluation. It is not in the scope of this\nguideline to deﬁne a standard follow-up frequency. The fre-\nquency should take into account many parameters including\ndisease types and stages, treatment periodicity and standard\npractice. However, these limitations of the precision of the\nmeasured endpoint should be taken into account if compari-\nsons between trials are to be made.\n4.7.\nProgression-free survival/proportion progression-free\n4.7.1.\nPhase II trials\nThis guideline is focused primarily on the use of objective re-\nsponse endpoints for phase II trials. In some circumstances, ‘re-\nsponse rate’ may not be the optimal method to assess the\npotential anticancer activity of new agents/regimens. In such\ncases ‘progression-free survival’ (PFS) or the ‘proportion pro-\ngression-free’ at landmark time points, might be considered\nappropriate alternatives to provide an initial signal of biologic\neffect of new agents. It is clear, however, that in an uncontrolled\ntrial, these measures are subject to criticism since an appar-\nently promising observation may be related to biological factors\nsuch as patient selectionand not theimpactof theintervention.\nThus, phase II screening trials utilising these endpoints are best\ndesigned with a randomised control. Exceptions may exist\n236\nE U R O P E A N J O U R N A L O F C A N C E R 4 5 ( 2 0 0 9 ) 2 2 8 –2 4 7",

      "text": "where the behaviour patterns of certain cancers are so consis-\ntent (and usually consistently poor), that a non-randomised\ntrial is justiﬁable (see for example van Glabbeke et al.20). How-\never, in these cases it will be essential to document with care\nthe basis for estimating the expected PFS or proportion progres-\nsion-free in the absence of a treatment effect.\n4.7.2.\nPhase III trials\nPhase III trials in advanced cancers are increasingly designed\nto evaluate progression-free survival or time to progression as\nthe primary outcome of interest. Assessment of progression\nis relatively straightforward if the protocol requires all pa-\ntients to have measurable disease. However, restricting entry\nto this subset of patients is subject to criticism: it may result\nin a trial where the results are less likely to be generalisable if,\nin the disease under study, a substantial proportion of pa-\ntients would be excluded. Moreover, the restriction to entry\nwill slow recruitment to the study. Increasingly, therefore, tri-\nals allow entry of both patients with measurable disease as\nwell as those with non-measurable disease only. In this cir-\ncumstance, care must be taken to explicitly describe the ﬁnd-\nings which would qualify for progressive disease for those\npatients without measurable lesions. Furthermore, in this set-\nting, protocols must indicate if the maximum number of re-\ncorded target lesions for those patients with measurable\ndisease may be relaxed from ﬁve to three (based on the data\nfound in Bogaerts et al.10 and Moskowitz et al.11). As found in\nthe ‘special notes on assessment of progression’, these guide-\nlines offer recommendations for assessment of progression\nin this setting. Furthermore, if available, validated tumour mar-\nker measures of progression (as has been proposed for ovarian\ncancer) may be useful to integrate into the deﬁnition of pro-\ngression. Centralised blinded review of imaging studies or of\nsource imaging reports to verify ‘unequivocal progression’\nmay be needed if important drug development or drug ap-\nproval decisions are to be based on the study outcome. Finally,\nas noted earlier, because the date of progression is subject to\nascertainment bias, timing of investigations in study arms\nshould be the same. The article by Dancey et al. in this special\nissue21 provides a more detailed discussion of the assessment\nof progression in randomised trials.\n4.8.\nIndependent review of response and progression\nFor trials where objective response (CR + PR) is the primary end-\npoint, and in particular where key drug development deci-\nsions are based on the observation of a minimum number of\nresponders, it is recommended that all claimed responses be\nreviewed by an expert(s) independent of the study. If the study\nis a randomised trial, ideally reviewers should be blinded to\ntreatment assignment. Simultaneous review of the patients’\nﬁles and radiological images is the best approach.\nIndependent review of progression presents some more\ncomplex issues: for example, there are statistical problems\nwith the use of central-review-based progression time in\nplace of investigator-based progression time due to the poten-\ntial introduction of informative censoring when the former\nprecedes the latter. An overview of these factors and other\nlessons learned from independent review is provided in an\narticle by Ford et al. in this special issue.22\n4.9.\nReporting best response results\n4.9.1.\nPhase II trials\nWhen response is the primary endpoint, and thus all patients\nmust have measurable disease to enter the trial, all patients\nincluded in the study must be accounted for in the report of\nthe results, even if there are major protocol treatment devia-\ntions or if they are not evaluable. Each patient will be assigned\none of the following categories:\n1. Complete response\n2. Partial response\n3. Stable disease\n4. Progression\n5. Inevaluable for response: specify reasons (for example: early\ndeath, malignant disease; early death, toxicity; tumour\nassessments not repeated/incomplete; other (specify)).\nNormally, all eligible patients should be included in the\ndenominator for the calculation of the response rate for phase\nII trials (in some protocols it will be appropriate to include all\ntreated patients). It is generally preferred that 95% two-sided\nconﬁdence limits are given for the calculated response rate.\nTrial conclusions should be based on the response rate for\nall eligible (or all treated) patients and should not be based\non a selected ‘evaluable’ subset.\n4.9.2.\nPhase III trials\nResponse evaluation in phase III trials may be an indicator\nof the relative anti-tumour activity of the treatments eval-\nuated and is almost always a secondary endpoint. Ob-\nserved differences in response rate may not predict the\nclinically relevant therapeutic beneﬁt for the population\nstudied. If objective response is selected as a primary end-\npoint for a phase III study (only in circumstances where a\ndirect relationship between objective tumour response and\na clinically relevant therapeutic beneﬁt can be unambigu-\nously demonstrated for the population studied), the same\ncriteria as those applying to phase II trials should be used\nand all patients entered should have at least one measur-\nable lesion.\nIn those many cases where response is a secondary end-\npoint and not all trial patients have measurable disease, the\nmethod for reporting overall best response rates must be\npre-speciﬁed in the protocol. In practice, response rate may\nbe reported using either an ‘intent to treat’ analysis (all ran-\ndomised patients in the denominator) or an analysis where\nonly the subset of patients with measurable disease at\nbaseline are included. The protocol should clearly specify\nhow response results will be reported, including any subset\nanalyses that are planned.\nThe original version of RECIST suggested that in phase III\ntrials one could write protocols using a ‘relaxed’ interpreta-\ntion of the RECIST guidelines (for example, reducing the num-\nber of lesions measured) but this should no longer be done\nsince these revised guidelines have been amended in such a\nway that it is clear how these criteria should be applied for\nall trials in which anatomical assessment of tumour response\nor progression are endpoints.\nE U R O P E A N J O U R N A L O F C A N C E R 4 5 ( 2 0 0 9 ) 2 2 8 –2 4 7\n237",

Standardisation of\nimaging requirements and image acquisition parameters is\nideal to allow for optimal comparability of subjects within a\nstudy and results between studies. These recommendations\nare designed to balance optimised image acquisition proto-\ncols with techniques that should be feasible to perform glob-\nally at imaging facilities in all types of radiology practices.\nThese guidelines are not applicable to functional imaging\ntechniques or volumetric assessment of tumour size.\nScanner quality control is highly recommended and should\nfollow\nstandard\nmanufacturer\nand\nfacility\nmaintenance\nschedules using commercial phantoms. It is likely that for RE-\nCIST unidimensional measurements this will be adequate to\nproduce reproducible measurements. Imaging quality control\nfor CT includes an analysis of image noise and uniformity and\nCT number as well as spatial resolution. The frequency of\nquality control analysis is also variable and should focus on\nclinically relevant scanning parameters. Dose analysis is al-\nways important and the use of imaging should follow the\nALARA principle, ‘As Low As Reasonably Achievable’, which\nrefers to making every reasonable effort to maintain radiation\nexposures as far below the dose limits as possible.\nSpeciﬁc.notes\nChest X-ray measurement of lesions surrounded by pulmon-\nary\nparenchyma\nis\nfeasible,\nbut\nnot\npreferable\nas\nthe\nmeasurement represents a summation of densities. Further-\nmore, there is poor identiﬁcation of new lesions within the\nchest on X-ray as compared with CT. Therefore, measure-\nments of pulmonary parenchymal lesions as well as medias-\ntinal disease are optimally performed with CT of the chest.\nMRI of the chest should only be performed in extenuating cir-\ncumstances. Even if IV contrast cannot be administered (for\nexample, in the situation of allergy to contrast), a non-con-\ntrast CT of the chest is still preferred over MRI or chest X-ray.\nCT scans: CT scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis should\nbe contiguous throughout all the anatomic region of interest.\nAs a general rule, the minimum size of a measurable lesion at\nbaseline should be no less than double the slice thickness and\nalso have a minimum size of 10 mm (see below for minimum\nsize when scanners have a slice thickness more than 5 mm).\nWhile the precise physics of lesion size and partial volume\naveraging is complex, lesions smaller than 10 mm may be dif-\nﬁcult to accurately and reproducibly measure. While this rule\nis applicable to baseline scans, as lesions potentially decrease\nin size at follow-up CT studies, they should still be measured.\nLesions which are reported as ‘too small to measure’ should\nbe assigned a default measurement of 5 mm if they are still\nvisible.\nThe most critical CT image acquisition parameters for opti-\nmal tumour evaluation using RECIST are anatomic coverage,\ncontrast administration, slice thickness, and reconstruction interval.\na. Anatomic coverage: Optimal anatomic coverage for most\nsolid tumours is the chest, abdomen and pelvis. Cover-\nage should encompass all areas of known predilection\nfor metastases in the disease under evaluation and\n240\nE U R O P E A N J O U R N A L O F C A N C E R 4 5 ( 2 0 0 9 ) 2 2 8 –2 4 7",

      "text": "should additionally investigate areas that may be\ninvolved based on signs and symptoms of individual\npatients. Because a lesion later identiﬁed in a body part\nnot scanned at baseline would be considered as a new\nlesion representing disease progression, careful consid-\neration should begiven to the extent of imaging coverage\nat baseline and at subsequent follow-up time points.\nThis will enable better consistency not only of tumour\nmeasurements but also identiﬁcation of new disease.\nb. IV contrast administration: Optimal visualisation and\nmeasurement of metastases in solid tumours requires\nconsistent administration (dose and rate) of IV contrast\nas well as timing of scanning. Typically, most abdomi-\nnal imaging is performed during the portal venous\nphase and (optimally) about the same time frame after\ninjection on each examination (see Fig. 1 for impact of\ndifferent phase of IV contrast on lesion measurement).\nMost solid tumours may be scanned with a single\nphase after administration of contrast. While triphasic\nCT scans are sometimes performed on other types of\nvascular tumours to improve lesion conspicuity, for\nconsistency and uniformity, we would recommend tri-\nphasic\nCT\nfor\nhepatocellular\nand\nneuroendocrine\ntumours for which this scanning protocol is generally\nstandard of care, and the improved temporal resolution\nof the triphasic scan will enhance the radiologists’ abil-\nity to consistently and reproducibly measure these\nlesions. The precise dose and rate of IV contrast is\ndependent upon the CT scanning equipment, CT acqui-\nsition protocol, the type of contrast used, the available\nvenous\naccess\nand\nthe\nmedical\ncondition\nof\nthe\npatient. Therefore, the method of administration of\nintravenous contrast agents is variable. Rather than\ntry to institute rigid rules regarding methods for\nadministering contrast agents and the volume injected,\nit is appropriate to suggest that an adequate volume of\na suitable contrast agent should be given so that the\nmetastases are demonstrated to best effect and a con-\nsistent method is used on subsequent examinations for\nany given patient (ideally, this would be speciﬁed in\nthe protocol or for an institution). It is very important\nthat the same technique be used at baseline and on fol-\nlow-up examinations for a given patient. This will\ngreatly enhance the reproducibility of the tumour mea-\nsurements. If prior to enrolment it is known a patient is\nnot able to undergo CT scans with IV contrast due to\nallergy\nor\nrenal\ninsufﬁciency,\nthe\ndecision\nas\nto\nwhether a non-contrast CT or MRI (with or without IV\ncontrast) should be used to evaluate the subject at\nbaseline and follow-up should be guided by the tumour\ntype under investigation and the anatomic location of\nthe disease. For patients who develop contraindica-\ntions to contrast after baseline contrast CT is done,\nthe decision as to whether non-contrast CT or MRI\n(enhanced or non-enhanced) should be performed\nshould also be based on the tumour type, anatomic\nlocation of the disease and should be optimised to\nallow for comparison to the prior studies if possible.\nEach case should be discussed with the radiologist to\ndetermine if substitution of these other approaches is\npossible and, if not, the patient should be considered\nnot evaluable from that point forward. Care must be\ntaken in measurement of target lesions on a different\nmodality and interpretation of non-target disease or\nnew lesions, since the same lesion may appear to have\na different size using a new modality (see Fig. 2 for a\ncomparison of CT and MRI of the same lesion). Oral\ncontrast is recommended to help visualise and differ-\nentiate structures in the abdomen.\nc. Slice thickness and reconstruction interval: RECIST measure-\nments may be performed at most clinically obtained\nslice thicknesses. It is recommended that CT scans be\nperformed at 5 mm contiguous slice thickness or less\nand indeed this guideline presumes a minimum 5 mm\nthickness in recommendations for measurable lesion\ndeﬁnition. Indeed, variations in slice thickness can have\nan impact on lesion measurement and on detection of\nnew lesions. However, consideration should also be\ngiven for minimising radiation exposure. With these\nparameters, a minimum 10 mm lesion is considered\nmeasurable at baseline. Occasionally, institutions may\nperform medically acceptable scans at slice thicknesses\ngreater than 5 mm. If this occurs, the minimum size of\nmeasurable lesions at baseline should be twice the slice\nFig. 1 – Difference in measurement/visualisation with different phases of IV contrast administration. Hypervascular\nmetastases imaged in the arterial phase (left) and the portal venous phase (right). Note that the number of lesions visible\ndiffers greatly between the two phases of contrast administration as does any potential lesion measurement.

Most contemporary CT\nscanners are multidetector which have many imaging\noptions for these acquisition parameters.23 The equip-\nment vendor and scanning manual should be reviewed\nif there are any speciﬁc system questions.\nd. Alternative contrast agents: There are a number of other,\nnew contrast agents, some organ speciﬁc.24 They may\nbe used as part of patient care for instance, in liver\nlesion assessment, or lymph node characterisation25,\nbut should not as yet be used in clinical trials.\nFDG-PET has gained acceptance as a valuable tool for\ndetecting, staging and restaging several malignancies. Criteria\nfor incorporating (or substituting) FDG-PET into anatomical\nassessment of tumour response in phase II trials are not yet\navailable, though much research is ongoing. Nevertheless,\nFDG-PET is being used in many drug development trials both\nas a tool to assess therapeutic efﬁcacy and also in assessment\nof progression. If FDG-PET scans are included in a protocol, by\nconsensus, an FDG uptake period of 60 min prior to imaging\nhas been decided as the most appropriate for imaging of pa-\ntients with malignancy.26 Whole-body acquisition is impor-\ntant since this allows for sampling of all areas of interest\nand can assess if new lesions have appeared thus determining\nthe possibility of interval progression of disease. Images from\nthe base of the skull to the level of the mid-thigh should be ob-\ntained 60 min post injection. PET camera speciﬁcations are\nvariable and manufacturer speciﬁc, so every attempt should\nbe made to use the same scanner, or the same model scanner,\nfor serial scans on the same patient. Whole-body acquisitions\ncan be performed in either 2- or 3-dimensional mode with\nattenuation correction, but the method chosen should be con-\nsistent across all patients and serial scans in the clinical trial.\nPET/CT scans: Combined modality scanning such as with\nPET–CT is increasingly used in clinical care, and is a modal-\nity/technology that is in rapid evolution; therefore, the recom-\nmendations in this paper may change rather quickly with\ntime. At present, low dose or attenuation correction CT por-\ntions of a combined PET–CT are of limited use in anatomically\nbased efﬁcacy assessments and it is therefore suggested that\nthey should not be substituted for dedicated diagnostic con-\ntrast enhanced CT scans for anatomically based RECIST mea-\nsurements. However, if a site can document that the CT\nperformed as part of a PET–CT is of identical diagnostic qual-\nity to a diagnostic CT (with IV and oral contrast) then the CT\nportion of the PET–CT can be used for RECIST measurements.\nNote, however, that the PET portion of the CT introduces addi-\ntional data which may bias an investigator if it is not routinely\nor serially performed.\nUltrasound examinations should not be used in clinical trials\nto measure tumour regression or progression of lesions be-\ncause the examination is necessarily subjective and operator\ndependent. The reasons for this are several: Entire examina-\ntions cannot be reproduced for independent review at a later\ndate, and it must be assumed, whether or not it is the case,\nthat the hard-copy ﬁlms available represent a true and accu-\nrate reﬂection of events. Furthermore, if, for example, the\nonly measurable lesion is in the para-aortic region of the\nabdomen and if gas in the bowel overlies the lesion, the lesion\nwill not be detected because the ultrasound beam cannot\npenetrate the gas. Accordingly, the disease staging (or restag-\ning for treatment evaluation) for this patient will not be\naccurate.\nWhile evaluation of lesions by physical examination is also\nof limited reproducibility, it is permitted when lesions are\nsuperﬁcial, at least 10 mm size, and can be assessed using\ncalipers. In general, it is preferred if patients on clinical trials\nhave at least one lesion that is measurable by CT. Other skin\nor palpable lesions may be measured on physical examina-\ntion and be considered target lesions.\nUse of MRI remains a complex issue. MRI has excellent\ncontrast, spatial and temporal resolution; however, there\nare many image acquisition variables involved in MRI, which\ngreatly impact image quality, lesion conspicuity and mea-\nsurement. Furthermore, the availability of MRI is variable\nglobally. As with CT, if an MRI is performed, the technical\nspeciﬁcations of the scanning sequences used should be\noptimised for the evaluation of the type and site of disease.\nFurthermore, as with CT, the modality used at follow-up\nshould be the same as was used at baseline and the lesions\nshould be measured/assessed on the same pulse sequence.\nGenerally, axial imaging of the abdomen and pelvis with T1\nand T2 weighted imaging along with gadolinium enhanced\nimaging should be performed. The ﬁeld of view, matrix,\nnumber of excitations, phase encode steps, use of fat sup-\npression and fast sequences should be optimised for the spe-\nFig. 2 – CT versus MRI of same lesions showing apparent ‘progression’ due only to differing method of measurement.\n242\nE U R O P E A N J O U R N A L O F C A N C E R 4 5 ( 2 0 0 9 ) 2 2 8 –2 4 7",

It\nis beyond the scope of this document or appendix to pre-\nscribe speciﬁc MRI pulse sequence parameters for all scan-\nners, body parts and diseases. Ideally, the same type of\nscanner should be used and the image acquisition protocol\nshould be followed as closely as possible to prior scans. Body\nscans should be performed with breath-hold scanning tech-\nniques if possible.\nSelection of target lesions: In general, the largest lesions rep-\nresentative of involved organs (up to a maximum of two per\norgan and ﬁve total) are selected to follow as target lesions.\nHowever, in some cases, the largest lesions may not be easily\nmeasured and are not suitable for follow-up because of their\nconﬁguration. In these cases, identiﬁcation of the largest most\nreproducible lesions is advised. Fig. 3 provides an illustrative\nexample where the largest lesion is not the most reproducible\nand another lesion is better to select and follow:\nMeasurement of lesions\nThe longest diameter of selected lesions should be measured\nin the plane in which the images were acquired. For body CT,\nthis is the axial plane. In the event isotropic reconstructions\nare performed, measurements can be made on these recon-\nstructed images; however, it should be cautioned that not\nall radiology sites are capable of producing isotropic recon-\nstructions. This could lead to the undesirable situation of\nmeasurements in the axial plane at one assessment point\nand in a different plane at a subsequent assessment. There\nare some tumours, for instance paraspinal lesions, which\nare better measured in the coronal or sagittal plane. It would\nbe acceptable to measure these lesions in these planes if the\nreconstructions in those planes were isotropic or the images\nwere acquired with MRI in those planes. Using the same plane\nof evaluation, the maximal diameter of each target lesion\nshould always be measured at subsequent follow-up time\npoints even if this results in measuring the lesion at a differ-\nent slice level or in a different orientation or vector compared\nwith the baseline study. Software tools that calculate the\nmaximal diameter for a perimeter of a tumour may be em-\nployed and may even reduce variability.\nThe only exception to the longest diameter rule is lymph\nnode measurement. Because malignant nodes are identiﬁed\nby the length of their short axis, this is the guide used to\ndetermine not only whether they are pathological but is also\nthe dimension measured for adding into the sum of target le-\nsions. Fig. 4 illustrates this point: the large arrow identiﬁes a\nmalignant node: the shorter perpendicular axis is P15 mm\nand will be recorded. Close by (small arrow) there is a normal\nnode: note here the long axis is greater than 10 mm but the\nshort axis is well below 10 mm. This node should be consid-\nered non-pathological.\nIf a lesion disappears and reappears at a subsequent time\npoint it should continue to be measured. However, the pa-\ntient’s response at the point in time when the lesion reap-\npears will depend upon the status of his/her other lesions.\nFor example, if the patient’s tumour had reached a CR status\nand the lesion reappeared, then the patient would be consid-\nered PD at the time of reappearance. In contrast, if the tumour\nstatus was a PR or SD and one lesion which had disappeared\nthen reappears, its maximal diameter should be added to the\nsum of the remaining lesions for a calculated response: in\nother words, the reappearance of an apparently ‘disappeared’\nsingle lesion amongst many which remain is not in itself en-\nFig. 3 – Largest lesion may not be most reproducible: most reproducible should be selected as target. In this example, the\nprimary gastric lesion (circled at baseline and at follow-up in the top two images) may be able to be measured with thin\nsection volumetric CT with the same degree of gastric distention at baseline and follow-up. However, this is potentially\nchallenging to reproduce in a multicentre trial and if attempted should be done with careful imaging input and analysis. The\nmost reproducible lesion is a lymph node (circled at baseline and at follow-up in the bottom two images).\nE U R O P E A N J O U R N A L O F C A N C E R 4 5 ( 2 0 0 9 ) 2 2 8 –2 4 7\n243",

      "text": "ough to qualify for PD: that requires the sum of all lesions to\nmeet the PD criteria. The rationale for such a categorisation is\nbased upon the realisation that most lesions do not actually\n‘disappear’ but are not visualised because they are beyond\nthe resolving power of the imaging modality employed.\nThe identiﬁcation of the precise boundary deﬁnition of a\nlesion may be difﬁcult especially when the lesion is embed-\nded in an organ with a similar contrast such as the liver, pan-\ncreas, kidney, adrenal or spleen. Additionally, peritumoural\noedema may surround a lesion and may be difﬁcult to distin-\nguish on certain modalities between this oedema and actual\ntumour. In fact, pathologically, the presence of tumour cells\nwithin the oedema region is variable. Therefore, it is most\ncritical that the measurements be obtained in a reproducible\nmanner from baseline and all subsequent follow-up time-\npoints. This is also a strong reason to consistently utilise\nthe same imaging modality.\nWhen lesions ‘fragment’, the individual lesion diameters\nshould be added together to calculate the target lesion\nsum. Similarly, as lesions coalesce, a plane between them\nmay be maintained that would aid in obtaining maximal\ndiameter measurements of each individual lesion. If the le-\nsions have truly coalesced such that they are no longer sep-\narable, the vector of the longest diameter in this instance\nshould be the maximal longest diameter for the ‘merged\nlesion’.\nProgression of non-target lesions\nTo achieve ‘unequivocal progression’ there must be an overall\nlevel of substantial worsening in non-target disease that is of\na magnitude that, even in the presence of SD or PR in target\ndisease, the treating physician would feel it important to\nchange therapy. Examples of unequivocal progression are\nshown in Figs. 5 and 6.\nFig. 5 – Example of unequivocal progression in non-target lesions in liver.\nFig. 6 – Example of unequivocal progression in non-target lesion (nodes).\nFig. 4 – Lymph node assessment: large arrow illustrates a\npathological node with the short axis shown as a solid line\nwhich should be measured and followed.

Frequently asked questions\nQuestion\nAnswer\nWhat should be done if several unique lesions at\nbaseline become conﬂuent at a follow-up\nevaluation?\nMeasure the longest diameter of the conﬂuent mass and record to add into the sum of\nthe longest diameters\nHow large does a new lesion have to be to count\nas progression? Does any small subcentimetre\nlesion qualify, or should the lesion be at least\nmeasurable?\nNew lesions do not need to meet ‘measurability criteria’ to be considered valid. If it is\nclear on previous images (with the same technique) that a lesion was absent then its\ndeﬁnitive appearance implies progression. If there is any doubt (because of the\ntechniques or conditions) then it is suggested that treatment continue until next\nscheduled assessment when, generally, all should be clear. Either it gets bigger and the\ndate of progression is the date of the ﬁrst suspicion, or it disappears and one may then\nconsider it an artefact with the support of the radiologists\nHow should one lesion be measured if on\nsubsequent exams it is split into two?\nMeasure the longest diameter of each lesion and add this into the sum\nDoes the deﬁnition of progression depend on\nthe status of all target lesions or only one?\nAs per the RECIST 1.1 guideline, progression requires a 20% increase in the sum of\ndiameters of all target lesions AND a minimum absolute increase of 5 mm in the sum\nAre RECIST criteria accepted by regulatory\nagencies?\nMany cooperative groups and members of pharma were involved in preparing RECIST\n1.0 and have adopted them. The FDA was consulted in their development and supports\ntheir use, though they don’t require it. The European and Canadian regulatory\nauthorities also participated and the RECIST criteria are now integrated in the European\nnote for guidance for the development of anticancer agents. Many pharmaceutical\ncompanies are also using them. RECIST 1.1 was similarly widely distributed before\npublication\nWhat is the criterion for a measurable lesion if\nthe CT slice thickness is >5 mm?\nRECIST 1.1 recommends that CT scans have a maximum slice thickness of 5 mm and the\nminimum size for a measurable lesion is twice that: 10 mm (even if slice thickness is\n<5 mm). If scanners with slice thickness >5 mm are used, the minimum lesion size must\nhave a longest diameter twice the actual slice thickness\nWhat should we record when target lesions\nbecome so small they are below the 10 mm\n‘measurable’ size?\nTarget lesion measurability is deﬁned at baseline. Thereafter, actual measurements,\neven if <10 mm, should be recorded. If lesions become very small, some radiologists\nindicate they are ‘too small to measure’. This guideline advises that when this occurs, if\nthe lesion is actually still present, a default measurement of 5 mm should be applied. If\nin fact the radiologist believes the lesion has gone, a default measurement of 0 mm\nshould be recorded\nIf a patient has several lesions which have\ndecreased in size to meet PR criteria and one\nhas actually disappeared, does that patient have\nPD if the ‘disappeared’ lesion reappears?\nUnless the sum meets the PD criteria, the reappearance of a lesion in the setting of PR (or\nSD) is not PD. The lesion should simply be added into the sum.\nIf the patients had had a CR, clearly reappearance of an absent lesion would qualify for\nPD\nWhen measuring the longest diameter of target\nlesions in response to treatment, is the same\naxis that was used initially used subsequently,\neven if there is a shape change to the lesion that\nmay have produced a new longest diameter?\nThe longest diameter of the lesion should always be measured even if the actual axis is\ndifferent from the one used to measure the lesion initially (or at different time point\nduring follow-up)\nThe only exception to this is lymph nodes: as per RECIST 1.1 the short axis should\nalways be followed and as in the case of target lesions, the vector of the short axis may\nchange on follow-up\nTarget lesions have been selected at baseline\nand followed but then one of these target\nlesions then becomes non-evaluable (i.e.\ndifferent technique used)\nWhat may be done in such cases is one of the following:\nWhat is the effect this has on the other target\nlesions and the overall response?\n(a) If the patient is still being treated, call the centre to be sure that future evaluations are\ndone with the baseline technique so at least SOME courses are fully evaluable\n(b) If that is not possible, check if there IS a baseline exam by the same technique which\nwas used to follow patients...in which case if you retrieve the baseline measures from\nthat technique you retrieve the lesion evaluability\n(c) If neither (a) nor (b) is possible then it is a judgement call about whether you delete\nthe lesion from all forms or consider the impact of the lesion overall is so important that\nits being non-evaluable makes the overall response interpretation inevaluable without\nit.

It is also\npossible that the non-target lesion has undergone such substantial\nprogression that it would override the target disease and render patient\nPD. However, this is very unlikely, especially if the rest of the measurable\ndisease is stable or responding\nA patient has a 32% decrease in sum cycle 2, a 28% decrease cycle\n4 and a 33% decrease cycle 6. Does conﬁrmation of PR have to\ntake place in sequential scans or is a case like this conﬁrmed PR?\nIt is not infrequent that tumour shrinkage hovers around the 30% mark.\nIn this case, most would consider PR to have been conﬁrmed looking at\nthis overall case. Had there been two or three non-PR observations\nbetween the two time point PR responses, the most conservative\napproach would be to consider this case SD\nIn the setting of a breast cancer neoadjuvant study, would\nmammography not be used to assess lesions? Is CT preferred in\nthis setting?\nNeither CT nor mammography are optimal in this setting. MRI is the\npreferred modality to follow breast lesions in a neoadjuvant setting\nA patient has a lesion measurable by clinical exam and by CT\nscan. Which should be followed?\nCT scan. Always follow by imaging if that option exists since it can be\nreviewed and veriﬁed\nA lesion which was solid at baseline has become necrotic in the\ncentre. How should this be measured?\nThe longest diameter of the entire lesion should be followed. Eventually,\nnecrotic lesions which are responding to treatment decrease in size. In\nreporting the results of trials, you may wish to report on this\nphenomenon if it is seen frequently since some agents (e.g. angiogenesis\ninhibitors) may produce this effect\nIf I am going to use MRI to follow disease, what is minimum size\nfor measurability?\nMRI may be substituted for contrast enhanced CT for some sites, but not\nlung. The minimum size for measurability is the same as for CT (10 mm)\nas long as the scans are performed with slice thickness of 5 mm and no\ngap. In the event the MRI is performed with thicker slices, the size of a\nmeasurable lesion at baseline should be two times the slice thickness. In\nthe event there are inter-slice gaps, this also needs to be considered in\ndetermining the size of measurable lesions at baseline\nCan PET–CT be used with RECIST?\nAt present, the low dose or attenuation correction CT portion of a\ncombined PET–CT is not always of optimal diagnostic CT quality for use\nwith RECIST measurements. However, if your site has documented that\nthe CT performed as part of a PET–CT is of the same diagnostic quality as\na diagnostic CT (with IV and oral contrast) then the PET–CT can be used\nfor RECIST measurements. Note, however, that the PET portion of the CT\nintroduces additional data which may bias an investigator if it is not\nroutinely or serially performed\n246\nE U R O P E A N J O U R N A L O F C A N C E R 4 5 ( 2 0 0 9 ) 2 2 8 –2 4 7",

This led\nto confusion in interpretation of trial results6 and in fact,\nthe application of varying response criteria was shown to lead\nto very different conclusions about the efﬁcacy of the same\nregimen.7 In response to these problems, an International\nWorking Party was formed in the mid 1990s to standardise\nand simplify response criteria. New criteria, known as RECIST\n(Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours), were pub-\nlished in 2000.8 Key features of the original RECIST include\ndeﬁnitions of minimum size of measurable lesions, instruc-\ntions on how many lesions to follow (up to 10; a maximum\nﬁve per organ site), and the use of unidimensional, rather\nthan bidimensional, measures for overall evaluation of tu-\nmour burden.

With rare exceptions\n(e.g. mesothelioma), the use of unidimensional criteria seems\nto perform well in solid tumour phase II studies. However, a number of questions and issues have arisen\nwhich merit answers and further clarity. Amongst these\nare whether fewer than 10 lesions can be assessed without\naffecting the overall assigned response for patients (or the\nconclusion about activity in trials); how to apply RECIST in\nrandomised phase III trials where progression, not response,\nis the primary endpoint particularly if not all patients have\nmeasurable disease; whether or how to utilise newer imag-\ning technologies such as FDG-PET and MRI; how to handle\nassessment of lymph nodes; whether response conﬁrmation\nis truly needed; and, not least, the applicability of RECIST in\ntrials of targeted non-cytotoxic drugs.

Speciﬁcations for standard\nanatomical radiological imaging\nThese protocols for image acquisition of computed tomogra-\nphy (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are recom-\nmendations intended for patients on clinical trials where\nRECIST assessment will be performed. Standardisation of\nimaging requirements and image acquisition parameters is\nideal to allow for optimal comparability of subjects within a\nstudy and results between studies. These recommendations\nare designed to balance optimised image acquisition proto-\ncols with techniques that should be feasible to perform glob-\nally at imaging facilities in all types of radiology practices. These guidelines are not applicable to functional imaging\ntechniques or volumetric assessment of tumour size. Scanner quality control is highly recommended and should\nfollow\nstandard\nmanufacturer\nand\nfacility\nmaintenance\nschedules using commercial phantoms. It is likely that for RE-\nCIST unidimensional measurements this will be adequate to\nproduce reproducible measurements.",

While this rule\nis applicable to baseline scans, as lesions potentially decrease\nin size at follow-up CT studies, they should still be measured. Lesions which are reported as ‘too small to measure’ should\nbe assigned a default measurement of 5 mm if they are still\nvisible.

For example, if the patient’s tumour had reached a CR status\nand the lesion reappeared, then the patient would be consid-\nered PD at the time of reappearance. In contrast, if the tumour\nstatus was a PR or SD and one lesion which had disappeared\nthen reappears, its maximal diameter should be added to the\nsum of the remaining lesions for a calculated response: in\nother words, the reappearance of an apparently ‘disappeared’\nsingle lesion amongst many which remain is not in itself en-\nFig. 3 – Largest lesion may not be most reproducible: most reproducible should be selected as target.

The rationale for such a categorisation is\nbased upon the realisation that most lesions do not actually\n‘disappear’ but are not visualised because they are beyond\nthe resolving power of the imaging modality employed. The identiﬁcation of the precise boundary deﬁnition of a\nlesion may be difﬁcult especially when the lesion is embed-\nded in an organ with a similar contrast such as the liver, pan-\ncreas, kidney, adrenal or spleen. Additionally, peritumoural\noedema may surround a lesion and may be difﬁcult to distin-\nguish on certain modalities between this oedema and actual\ntumour. In fact, pathologically, the presence of tumour cells\nwithin the oedema region is variable. Therefore, it is most\ncritical that the measurements be obtained in a reproducible\nmanner from baseline and all subsequent follow-up time-\npoints. This is also a strong reason to consistently utilise\nthe same imaging modality. When lesions ‘fragment’, the individual lesion diameters\nshould be added together to calculate the target lesion\nsum. Similarly, as lesions coalesce, a plane between them\nmay be maintained that would aid in obtaining maximal\ndiameter measurements of each individual lesion. If the le-\nsions have truly coalesced such that they are no longer sep-\narable, the vector of the longest diameter in this instance\nshould be the maximal longest diameter for the ‘merged\nlesion’.",

If it is\nclear on previous images (with the same technique) that a lesion was absent then its\ndeﬁnitive appearance implies progression. If there is any doubt (because of the\ntechniques or conditions) then it is suggested that treatment continue until next\nscheduled assessment when, generally, all should be clear. Either it gets bigger and the\ndate of progression is the date of the ﬁrst suspicion, or it disappears and one may then\nconsider it an artefact with the support of the radiologists\nHow should one lesion be measured if on\nsubsequent exams it is split into two? Measure the longest diameter of each lesion and add this into the sum\nDoes the deﬁnition of progression depend on\nthe status of all target lesions or only one? As per the RECIST 1.1 guideline, progression requires a 20% increase in the sum of\ndiameters of all target lesions AND a minimum absolute increase of 5 mm in the sum\nAre RECIST criteria accepted by regulatory\nagencies?",

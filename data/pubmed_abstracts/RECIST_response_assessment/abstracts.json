    "abstract": "CSF1R-targeted pharmacotherapy is a viable treatment approach for TGCT but may be associated with pharmacologic side effects when given systemically. As a first study of its kind, intra-articular (IA) administration of an anti-CSF1R antibody (AMB-05X) into the knee of normal monkeys and TGCT patients was characterized. Following favorable results of 5 mg/kg IA dosing in monkeys, a multi-center, single-arm, Phase 2a trial was undertaken. IA AMB-05X was administered to the affected knee at 150 mg (N = 8) or 90 mg (N = 3) every 2 weeks for 12-weeks. Safety and tolerability, and efficacy (tumor response assessed on MRI and patient reported outcomes (PROs)), PK, PD, and anti-drug antibody (ADA) were evaluated. IA injection to monkeys was well-tolerated and AMB-05X knee synovial fluid levels were greater than that in serum with a similar half-life. In the clinical trial, most common low-grade treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were edema (55 %), fatigue (46 %), arthralgia (36 %), rash (36 %) and pruritus or hypertension (27 %). These events were lower in the 90 mg cohort compared to the 150 mg cohort. Q2W dosing resulted in accumulation of high synovial vs systemic AMB-05X (PK) and CSF1 (PD) levels. Objective tumor response by RECISTv1.1 was 36 % overall, while Modified RECIST was 45 %. PROs were significantly improved at 10-12 weeks. ADA was 0 %. Favorable PK, PD, efficacy, and safety/tolerability of intra-articular administration of an anti-CSF1R mAb for TGCT was validated. These results support further development of this novel treatment approach.",

    "abstract": "Select patients with metastatic clear-cell renal-cell carcinoma can be treated without systemic therapy, yet few studies have explored this population. We investigated the efficacy of metastasis-directed therapy without systemic therapy in oligometastatic clear-cell renal-cell carincoma. This investigator-initiated single-arm, phase 2 trial enrolled patients aged 18 years or older with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-2, histologically confirmed clear-cell renal-cell carcinoma, and one to five metastases. Patients remained off systemic therapy and underwent metastasis-directed therapy to all disease sites, with additional metastasis-directed therapy for limited progression. Co-primary endpoints were progression-free survival based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) in the per-protocol population (patients who received radiation to at least one metastatic lesion during their initial local treatment) and systemic therapy-free survival in the intention-to-treat population. Progression-free survival was defined as the interval from enrolment to the first instance of disease progression, according to RECIST 1.1, or clinical progression, or death from any cause. Systemic therapy-free survival was defined as time from enrolment to initiation of systemic therapy or death from clear-cell renal-cell carcinoma. A prespecified 24-month median systemic therapy-free survival was the threshold for success. Safety was analysed in the per-protocol population. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03575611, and is closed to new patient enrolment. Between July 13, 2018, and May 2, 2023, 121 patients were enrolled and included in the intention-to-treat population, of whom 120 received at least one round of definitive radiotherapy and were included in the per-protocol and safety populations. Median follow-up time for the 121 enrolled patients was 36·3 months (IQR 26·5-51·1). Median progression-free survival was 17·7 months (95% CI 14·9-22·4), and median systemic therapy-free survival time was 34·0 months (28·3-54·1). The median and lower bound of 95% CI of the median systemic therapy-free survival time exceeded the prespecified 24-month target. Eight (7%) of 120 patients had grade 3-4 adverse events at least possibly attributable to metastasis-directed therapy. The most common grade 3 event was pain near the treatment site (four events). The single grade 4 event was hyperglycaemia. There were no treatment-related deaths. Select patients with oligometastatic disease can be managed with serial metastasis-directed therapy with prolonged time off systemic therapy, favourable progression-free survival, and limited adverse events.

    "abstract": "This study aimed to assess whether total tumor volume (TTV) outperforms RECIST1.1 for treatment response assessment in patients with colorectal liver metastases (CRLM), and to investigate TTV as a predictive biomarker for the optimal systemic treatment regimen for individual patients with initially unresectable CRLM. Patients with initially unresectable liver-only CRLM from the phase 3 CAIRO5 trial (NCT02162563) were included. All patients received induction systemic treatment. Baseline TTV and changes in TTV and RECIST1.1 in response to systemic treatment were calculated using the CT scans before systemic treatment and at first follow-up, and were assessed for their prognostic and predictive value with multivariable Cox regression models. Results In total, 425 patients were included. In multivariable analyses, baseline TTV (adjusted HR [aHR] for 100 mL vs 10 mL, 2.44 [95 % CI, 1.25-4.76]; P = 0.006) and relative change in TTV were the strongest predictors for OS (aHR for 0 % change vs 50 % decrease, 2.57 [1.83-3.60]; P < 0.0001). In contrast, RECIST1.1 was not independently associated with OS (aHR for partial response vs progressive disease, 0.63 [95 % CI, 0.33-1.20]). Higher baseline TTV predicted a stronger treatment benefit of FOLFOX-/FOLFIRI-bevacizumab vs FOLFOX-/FOLFIRI-panitumumab on OS (P This study demonstrates that TTV (i) outperforms traditional risk factors for OS prognostication, and (ii) may be a more accurate and sensitive treatment response assessment method compared to the currently used RECIST1.1 system in patients with initially unresectable CRLM. Moreover, TTV assessment is a promising approach for individualized clinical decision-making between bevacizumab and panitumumab.",

    "abstract": "Preclinical studies have indicated that physical exercise may enhance chemotherapy efficacy. However, clinical trials are needed to investigate these findings. We hypothesized that an exercise program during neoadjuvant chemotherapy would improve tumor response in patients with breast cancer. Neo-train was a randomized controlled trial allocating patients with breast cancer to the usual care control (CON) group or the exercise (EX) group that received supervised high-intensity interval training and progressive resistance training 3 times weekly during 18 to 24 weeks of neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The two groups were compared on tumor size, assessed using magnetic resonance imaging as primary outcome, and secondary clinical/pathologic, biological, physical, and patient-reported outcomes. From 2021 to 2023, 102 participants were randomly assigned to the EX (n = 50) or CON (n = 52) group. We found no between-group differences in median tumor size change from baseline to presurgery (EX vs. CON -3.0 mm [95% confidence interval (CI), -8.0 to 14.0]), the proportion with radiologic complete response [EX 65% vs. CON 56%; odds ratio 1.16 (95% CI, 0.39-3.91)], or pathologic complete response [EX 59% vs. CON 56%; odds ratio 1.03 (95% CI, 0.43-2.46)]. The exercise program was associated with higher relative dose intensity, fewer dose delays, shorter hospital stays, and increased cardiorespiratory fitness, muscle strength, and level of physical activity. We found no differences in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, body composition, health-related quality of life, anxiety, depression, psychological distress, or participation in rehabilitation between groups. Although the exercise program did not affect tumor size, the positive effects on chemotherapy completion and shorter hospitalizations suggest improved treatment tolerance.",

This single-arm, investigator-initiated, open-label clinical trial enrolled patients with advanced HCC (NCT04665362). Patients received M1-c6v1 (9 × 108 cell culture infective dose 50%) intravenously for 5 days every 28 days, camrelizumab (200 mg) intravenously biweekly, and apatinib (250 mg) orally daily. Treatment continued for up to 1 year or until disease progression, intolerability, or withdrawal. Primary endpoints were safety and tolerability, and secondary endpoints assessed efficacy based on tumor response, progression-free survival, and overall survival. Thirteen patients were enrolled, with 84.6% having hepatitis B virus-related HCC and 76.9% presenting with tumors >10 cm. The treatment was well tolerated, with 92.15% of adverse events being grade 1 or 2. The most common adverse events included influenza-like symptoms and transient cytopenia. No viral shedding was detected in all secretions and excretions collected from subjects. In 10 patients evaluable for efficacy, the overall response rate was 70% (7/10), with seven partial responses according to modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (mRECIST). The median overall survival and progression-free survival were 15.4 and 8.9 months, respectively. The combination of M1-c6v1 with camrelizumab and apatinib demonstrates an acceptable safety profile and promising efficacy in advanced HCC.",

    "abstract": "Systemic molecular-targeted therapy is the standard of care for patients presenting with advanced-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC); however, tumor response rates are limited, mainly owing to HCC biomolecular and pathologic heterogeneity. Therefore, novel markers for noninvasive molecular profiling are needed. To determine whether advanced image analysis and machine learning on routinely acquired MRI scans can help predict HCC molecular profiles, thereby allowing biomarker-guided treatment allocations. This single-center retrospective study included treatment-naive patients with HCC who underwent tumor resection or liver transplant between September 2006 and February 2022. Multiparametric contrast-enhanced MRI data were obtained, and quantitative and qualitative imaging markers were extracted from lesion and liver segmentations. Pathologic analysis of the resected samples was performed via immunohistochemistry to assess p53 loss of function; catenin beta 1 (CTNNB1) activation; forkhead box M1 activation; and programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1), phosphorylated AKT serine/threonine kinase, phosphorylated SMAD2/3, and sterol O-acyltransferase 1 expression. For each molecular profile outcome, a multivariable logistic regression model was built separately using quantitative imaging, qualitative imaging, or clinical data. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was used to evaluate model discriminatory performance, and DeLong tests were performed to compare AUCs across models trained on the different data. Seventy-five patients with T1-weighted, contrast-enhanced, dynamic MRI scans (mean age, 65.7 years ± 9.43 [SD]; 60 males) were included. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis demonstrated the good discriminatory performance of logistic regression models trained on quantitative imaging data for PD-L1, p53, and CTNNB1, with AUCs of 0.85 (95% CI: 0.74, 0.96), 0.79 (95% CI: 0.66, 0.93), and 0.7 (95% CI: 0.46, 0.93), respectively. Models trained on clinical and qualitative imaging data yielded lower AUCs across profiles, of 0.36 (95% CI: 0.2, 0.53;  Quantitative MRI markers derived from whole tumor and liver volumes can potentially predict p53, PD-L1, and CTNNB1 status in HCC. © RSNA, 2025 ",

Patients received escalating intravenous obrixtamig doses using four regimens: a fixed dose once every 3 weeks (A); a fixed dose once weekly (B1); a step-up dose once weekly for two weeks and target dose once weekly (B2); and a step-up dose once weekly for 3 weeks, target dose once weekly for 3 weeks, and once every 3 weeks thereafter (B3). The primary objective was maximum tolerated dose (MTD). Secondary objectives included safety, pharmacokinetics, and tumor response (RECIST v1.1). As of February 21, 2024, 168 patients received obrixtamig, 72% received ≥2 lines of previous anticancer therapy, and 51% received previous anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy. Seven dose-limiting toxicities occurred during MTD evaluation (Regimen A, n = 1; Regimen B2, n = 6). MTD was not reached. The most common treatment-related adverse event was cytokine release syndrome (any grade: 57%; grade ≥3: 3%); most cases occurred early and were reversible. Across all doses, regimens, and tumor types, the overall response rate (ORR) was 23% (95% CI, 17.4% to 30.2%), the median duration of response (DoR) was 8.5 months (95% CI, 6.2 to not reached), and the 6-month DoR rate was 70% (95% CI, 53% to 88%).

    "abstract": "This study aimed to preliminarily evaluate the safety, tolerability, and antitumor efficacy of hepatitis B virus (HBV)-specific T-cell receptor (TCR)-T cell therapy combining mRNA electroporation and lentiviral transduction in patients with recurrent HBV-hepatocellular carcinoma after liver transplantation. In this pilot study (NCT04677088), two types of autologous HBV-specific TCR-redirected T cells were assessed without prior lymphodepletion: (i) multiple infusions of mRNA-electroporated HBV-TCR-T cells (mRNA-HBV-TCR-T cells) and (ii) one to three infusions of lentiviral-transduced HBV-TCR-T cells (lenti-HBV-TCR-T cells). Treatment-related adverse events were assessed using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, and antitumor efficacy was evaluated using CT imaging according to RECIST v1.1 criteria. Progression-free survival (PFS) was defined as the time from the start of study treatment until objective tumor progression or death. Both mRNA-electroporated and lentiviral-transduced HBV-specific TCR-T cells demonstrated a favorable safety profile, with only grade 1 to 2 treatment-related adverse events observed. In the mRNA-HBV-TCR-T cells cohort, the median PFS was 2.32 months (range, 1.87-2.77 months). The combination therapy cohort (mRNA-HBV-TCR-T cells + lenti-HBV-TCR-T cells) showed a median PFS of 7.34 months (range, 4.47-7.60 months). CT imaging indicated effective tumor control in the combination therapy group. This study preliminarily suggests that the combination of mRNA-HBV-TCR-T cells and lenti-HBV-TCR-T cells could be a safe and potentially effective approach for treating patients following liver transplantation in the context of lifelong immunosuppression drug administration. Further studies are needed to refine treatment strategies and assess long-term safety and efficacy in this special patient population.",

    "abstract": "Neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC) is an aggressive form of prostate cancer with poor prognosis and limited treatment options. As NEPC aberrantly expresses delta-like ligand 3 (DLL3), the activity of tarlatamab, a bispecific T-cell engager that directs cytotoxic T cells to DLL3-positive (DLL3+) cells, was evaluated in the DeLLpro-300 study (NCT04702737). This was a phase 1b, open-label study evaluating tarlatamab monotherapy in patients with metastatic de novo or treatment-emergent NEPC defined by histologic, genomic, or IHC criteria. Tarlatamab was administered intravenously every 2 weeks at a dose of 100 mg with a 1-mg step dose. The primary objective was safety, and a secondary objective was objective response rate (ORR) per RECIST v.1.1; DLL3 expression was retrospectively assessed by IHC. Forty patients were enrolled (DLL3+ tumors, n = 18; DLL3- tumors, n = 14; and DLL3 unknown tumors, n = 8). The most common treatment-related adverse events were cytokine release syndrome (82.5%), dysgeusia (42.5%), and decreased appetite (40.0%). Cytokine release syndrome was predominantly of low grade (grade 1/2/3/4+, 62.5%/15%/5%/0%), occurred exclusively in cycle 1, and was transient in duration (median duration, 3 days). The ORR was 10.5% [95% confidence interval (CI), 2.9-24.8]; the median duration of response was 7.3 months in the overall cohort. Patients with DLL3+ tumors (vs. patients with DLL3-/DLL3 unknown tumors) achieved a higher ORR [22.2% (95% CI, 6.4-47.6) vs. 0% (95% CI, 0-15.4)] and radiographic progression-free survival rate at 6 months [27.7% (95% CI, 8.7-50.9) vs. 0%].

BO-112 is a synthetic, double-stranded RNA (poly I:C) nanoplexed with polyethylenimine that when administered intratumorally has showed in patients with solid tumors potential to revert this resistance. We report efficacy and safety of the phase II clinical trial of intratumoral BO-112 plus intravenous pembrolizumab for patients with anti-PD-1-resistant MEL (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04570332). Forty-two patients were treated with intratumoral BO-112 once every week for 7 weeks and then once every 3 weeks (up to 2 mg and up to eight lesions per treatment) combined with 200 mg pembrolizumab once every 3 weeks until progressive disease, unacceptable toxicity, death, or up to 1 year. Primary end point was RECIST 1.1 objective response rate (ORR) by independent central radiology review in modified intention-to-treat population (mITT; patients evaluable for response) with 20% ORR positivity threshold. Secondary key end points were progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), duration of response (DOR), and safety. For mITT, there were 40 patients and the ORR was 25%, with 10% complete, 15% partial, and 40% stable disease, with nonachieved (NA) median DOR (95% CI, 8.3 to NA).

Whether circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) may be predictive of progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in this treatment context remains unknown. To assess the prognostic and predictive role of ctDNA, detected by tumor-specific methylation markers, in patients with dMMR/MSI-H mCRC treated with ICIs. This prespecified secondary analysis of the SAMCO-PRODIGE 54 randomized clinical trial evaluated ctDNA in patients with dMMR/MSI-H mCRC treated with avelumab or standard chemotherapy, with or without a targeted agent in the second-line setting, to assess its prognostic role. Plasma samples were obtained prospectively for ctDNA analysis, and digital droplet polymerase chain reaction amplification of bisulfite-converted cell-free DNA (cfDNA) for WIF1 and NPY genes was used to quantify ctDNA levels. These samples were collected from April 2018 to April 2021 at 49 sites in France at baseline (V1) and 1-month posttreatment initiation (V2) during. Data analyses were performed from October 1 to November 1, 2024. Avelumab or standard chemotherapy with or without targeted agents.

In the 99 patients with available V1 plasma samples, baseline ctDNA positivity or concentration were not associated with clinical outcomes. Change in ctDNA (cutoff at median value) was significantly associated with both PFS (hazard ratio [HR], 2.98; 95% CI, 1.77-5.01; P < .001) and OS (HR, 3.61; 95% CI, 1.81-7.17; P < .001).

    "abstract": "Liquid biopsy helps detect cells and cell-derived metabolites, proteins, nucleic acids, and vesicles that are shed into body fluids by tumors. This diagnostic test requires only approximately 10 mL of blood or urine. It has received considerable attention as a minimally invasive tool for whole-body tumor interrogation for use in patients with cancer. It poses an attractive and potentially cost-effective alternative to invasive tissue sampling through tissue biopsies, especially serial assessments, such as for treatment response evaluation and mutations that occur during cancer treatment. Cell-free and circulating tumor DNA are the most frequently tested liquid biopsy analytes, and have shown promise for cancer screening, assessment of residual disease after treatment, and clinical outcome prediction and prognostication. Whereas liquid biopsy is less sensitive than imaging in early tumor stages, it is more specific and may help detect treatment response earlier than the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, or RECIST. Aimed primarily at radiologists, this review article provides an update on recent developments in the use of liquid biopsy, including findings from landmark clinical trials and U.S. regulatory approvals as companion diagnostic tests for clinical use, particularly in four malignancies: lymphoma, breast cancer, prostate cancer, and melanoma. Finally, current challenges for the clinical implementation of liquid biopsy are discussed.",

Eligible patients had MRI stage T3b to 4/N1 to 2/M0 LARC within 12 cm from the anal verge. Treatment consisted of long-course chemoradiotherapy (LCCRT) with 50.4 Gy and 5-fluorouracil or capecitabine, followed by four cycles of avelumab (10 mg/kg every 2 weeks). Surgical resection was performed 10 to 12 weeks after completion of LCCRT. Fresh tumor biopsies/ctDNA were taken before LCCRT, before avelumab, and at surgery. The primary endpoint was pCR, reported centrally. Secondary endpoints were imaging responses and toxicity, and exploratory endpoints were translational studies (immune evaluation by multiplex IHC and biopsy-derived tumoroids), distant relapse-free survival, and relapse sites. Thirty-seven patients entered the trial, of whom 33 received avelumab and 32 had surgery. The overall response rate by pelvic MRI (N = 33) was 48%. By 2-[¹⁸F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose PET, there were 10 complete metabolic responses (CMR) and 18 partial metabolic responses (PMR). Regression score 0 (modified Ryan pCR) was observed in 19% of patients (N = 6), and regression score 1 in 16% (N = 5). Overall, 34% of patients (N = 11) had a major pathologic response. Tumors with greater PDL1 expression showed superior pCR/tumor regression. Tumoroid studies indicated intact cellular machinery for PDL1/HLA class-1 expression modulated by IFNγ. No immune-related grade 3 adverse events were observed, and postoperative complications were as expected. The median follow-up was 3.1 years, the 3-year estimated time to progression was 82%, distant relapse-free survival was 80%, and disease-free survival was 80%. The Ave-Rec phase II study demonstrated that avelumab after LCCRT is deliverable and tolerable, with significant imaging responses and a major pathologic response rate. Tumoral immune cell subsets/checkpoint expression was predictive of pathologic response. The addition of immune checkpoint inhibitors warrants further evaluation in patients with LARC.",

    "abstract": "Treatment options for patients with advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) after failure of standard therapies with tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) remain very limited. As vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitors are considered to have immunomodulatory effects, we hypothesized that the combination of VEGF and PD-L1 inhibitors may have a synergistic effect and enhance the efficacy of both therapies. AXAGIST was a phase II trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of avelumab 10 mg/kg iv Q2W in combination with axitinib 5 mg po BID in patients with unresectable/metastatic GIST after failure of standard therapy. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) at 3 months based on RECIST 1.1 criteria. Secondary endpoints included PFS, overall survival (OS), overall response rate, and safety. Of the 58 patients enrolled, 56 patients were evaluable for safety and efficacy. Median age was 60 years (range 18-80), and 30 patients (53.4 %) had received three prior lines of TKIs. Median follow-up was 27.4 months. The best response was partial response in 5 patients (8.9 %), stable disease in 34 patients (60.7 %), and progressive disease in 17 patients (30.4 %). Among patients with partial response, the median duration of response was 18.5 months (95 %CI, 18.3-NA). The PFS rate at 3 months was 57.1 %. Median PFS and OS were 4.6 months (95 %CI, 2.9-6.4) and 14.2 months (95 %CI, 9.2-26.3), respectively. Adverse events occurred in 94.6 % of patients, while 30.4 % experienced grade 3 or higher adverse events. The results of the largest trial on the combination of targeted therapy and immunotherapy in pretreated GIST show the promising efficacy of this novel therapeutic approach in a subset of patients.",

    "abstract": "A previous study by our group using dendritic cells (DC) pulsed ex vivo with the lysate of the HepG2 cell line showed evidence of antigen-specific T-cell responses in some patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. The ImmunoTACE trial evaluated the preliminary activity of this vaccine in combination with transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) in patients with intermediate-stage hepatocellular carcinoma. A randomized phase II trial was conducted in three tertiary referral centers in the United Kingdom. Eligible patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to TACE + preconditioning cyclophosphamide or to TACE + preconditioning cyclophosphamide + DC infusions. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival time using RECIST v1.1 criteria. Additional endpoints included safety and immune responses. Between March 2016 and October 2019, 55 patients were randomized, of whom 48 were evaluable (24 in each group). The median progression-free survival time using RECIST criteria was 18.6 months in patients treated with chemoembolization + preconditioning cyclophosphamide + DC infusions compared with 10.4 months in those treated with chemoembolization + preconditioning cyclophosphamide alone (HR = 0.43; upper value of one-sided 80% confidence interval, 0.57; P = 0.016). The addition of DC infusions did not significantly increase the incidence or severity of adverse events. An enhanced antigen (α-fetoprotein)-specific immune response was observed in patients treated with DC vaccination. The addition of DC infusions to TACE and preconditioning cyclophosphamide has shown promising preliminary activity and merits further investigation in a larger randomized trial.",

    "title": "Mathematical Modeling and Association Analysis Decipher the Impact of the Gut Microbiome on Cancer Immunotherapy.",
    "abstract": "The gut microbiome has emerged as a key regulator of response to cancer immunotherapy. However, a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms by which the microbiome influences immunotherapy is needed to identify strategies to optimize outcomes. To this end, we developed a mathematical model to obtain insights into the effect of the microbiome on the immune system and immunotherapy response. This model was based on (i) gut microbiome data derived from preclinical studies, (ii) mathematical modeling of the antitumor immune response, (iii) association analysis of microbiome profiles with model-predicted immune profiles, and (iv) statistical models that correlate model parameters with the microbiome. The model was used to investigate the complexity of murine and human studies on microbiome modulation. Comparison of model predictions with experimental observations of tumor response in the training and test datasets supported the hypothesis that two model parameters, the activation and killing rate constants of immune cells, are the most influential in tumor progression and are potentially affected by microbiome composition. Evaluation of the associations between the gut microbiome and immune profile indicated that the components and structure of the gut microbiome affect the activation and killing rate of adaptive and innate immune cells. Overall, this study contributes to a deeper understanding of microbiome-cancer interactions and offers a framework for understanding how microbiome interactions influence cancer treatment outcomes. Integration of mathematical modeling and microbiome data reveals how gut microbiome components impact immune response, providing insights to optimize immunotherapy strategies.

    "abstract": "Human papillomavirus-associated (HPV+) oropharyngeal carcinoma is associated with excellent survival, yet treatment drives substantial toxicity. Improved biomarkers are needed to select patients for de-escalated treatment. Circulating tumor HPV DNA (ctHPV-DNA) represents a promising noninvasive biomarker to gauge treatment response and surveil for disease recurrence. A prospective biomarker clinical trial of response-stratified de-escalation was conducted. Eligible patients with non-metastatic HPV+ oropharyngeal carcinoma received neoadjuvant chemotherapy, followed by risk/response-stratified de-escalation with transoral robotic surgery, de-escalated radiation with or without chemotherapy to 50 Gy, or standard chemoradiation to 70 Gy. Deep response (≥50% tumor shrinkage per RECIST v1.1) qualified patients for de-escalation. ctHPV-DNA was measured using HPV-SEQ in plasma at baseline, during neoadjuvant chemotherapy, radiation, and following treatment. The primary endpoint was the correlation of ctHPV-DNA kinetics and radiographic response. Forty-six eligible patients were enrolled, and 488 ctHPV-DNA samples were analyzed (median 11 per patient). The median follow-up was 30 months, and five recurrences were observed (10.9%). Baseline ctHPV-DNA was detected in 95% of evaluable patients. Rapid early ctHPV-DNA clearance after one cycle of neoadjuvant therapy (≥95% reduction) predicted radiographic deep response (P = 0.04). Detection of ctHPV-DNA 3 months or later after treatment was associated with worse progression-free and overall survival (P < 0.001). Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of longitudinal ctHPV-DNA were 100%. The longest lead time from positive ctHPV-DNA to detection of recurrent disease was 25 months. Rapid early clearance of ctHPV-DNA during neoadjuvant therapy demonstrates utility in predicting response to treatment. Detectable ctHPV-DNA following treatment is predictive of both disease recurrence and worse survival.",

    "abstract": "Established first- and second-line standard-of-care treatment options (abiraterone, enzalutamide, taxane chemotherapy) are available for patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), but almost all patients experience subsequent disease progression. The randomized, double-blind, phase III KEYNOTE-641 study evaluated pembrolizumab plus enzalutamide versus placebo plus enzalutamide in participants with chemotherapy-naive mCRPC. Eligible participants were males aged ≥18 years with confirmed mCRPC and no prior chemotherapy except docetaxel in the hormone-sensitive setting. Prior abiraterone treatment was permitted. Participants were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive pembrolizumab 200 mg or placebo intravenously once every 3 weeks for ≤35 cycles plus enzalutamide 160 mg orally daily. Dual primary end points were overall survival (OS) and radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) per Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group (PCWG)-modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1) by blinded independent central review. Safety was a secondary end point. Between 21 August 2019, and 10 June 2022, 1244 participants were randomly assigned to pembrolizumab plus enzalutamide (n = 621) or placebo plus enzalutamide (n = 623). At the data cut-off date (12 December 2022), median follow-up was 27.6 months (range, 6.1-39.8 months). Primary end points of OS [median, 24.7 versus 27.3 months; hazard ratio (HR) 1.04, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.88-1.22, P = 0.66] and rPFS (median, 10.4 versus 9.0 months; HR 0.98, 95% CI 0.84-1.14, P = 0.41) with pembrolizumab plus enzalutamide versus placebo plus enzalutamide were not met. The prespecified boundary for futility for OS was crossed, and the study was stopped. Grade ≥3 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 192 of 615 participants (31.2%) with one or more doses of pembrolizumab plus enzalutamide and in 67 of 620 participants (10.8%) with one or more doses of placebo plus enzalutamide. Seventy-one (11.5%) and 21 (3.4%) participants, respectively, discontinued study treatment due to treatment-related adverse events. Adding pembrolizumab to enzalutamide did not improve efficacy outcomes for participants with chemotherapy-naive mCRPC. Additional toxicity was observed with the combination regimen.",

    "abstract": "Doxorubicin is standard chemotherapy for metastatic soft tissue sarcomas (STS) but also enhances innate/adaptive immune responses by inducing immunogenic cell death. Most STS are immune \"cold\" tumors that do not respond to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) blocking PD-1 and cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4. We hypothesized that concurrent doxorubicin would improve tumor immunogenicity and boost the efficacy of ICI in STS. We conducted a single-arm, phase 2 trial of doxorubicin plus zalifrelimab (anti-cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4 antibody) and balstilimab (anti-PD-1 antibody) for patients with advanced/metastatic STS without prior doxorubicin or ICI (NCT04028063). The study was a Simon minimax two-stage design to accrue 28 patients evaluable for primary endpoint of progression-free survival rate at 6 months (PFS6mo) by RECIST 1.1. The study aimed to improve PFS6mo by 20% over a historic null rate of 43.4% with doxorubicin monotherapy. Secondary endpoints included the objective response rate, disease control rate, overall survival, duration of response, and adverse events (AE). The PFS6mo for 28 evaluable patients was 46.4% [95% confidence interval (CI), 27.5-66.1] and not superior to the null rate, with a median PFS of 25.3 weeks (95% CI, 24.0-42). The best objective response rate was 33.3% (95% CI, 17.3-52.8) with a disease control rate of 80.0% (95% CI, 61.4-92.3), including STS types unlikely to respond to doxorubicin or ICI alone. Grade 3/4 treatment-related AE occurred in 45% of patients, with immune-mediated AE requiring immunosuppression in 9%. Although the study did not meet the predefined endpoint for PFS improvement, promising signals of efficacy warrant future investigation including response/resistance biomarkers to inform patient selection.",

We conducted a phase II study to assess the efficacy and safety of trabectedin and olaparib in patients with advanced disease. Patients with soft-tissue sarcoma who received ≥1 prior therapy were recruited into two cohorts. Cohort 1 included leiomyosarcoma and liposarcoma; cohort 2 included other histologies. All patients received trabectedin (1.1 mg/m2 24-hour infusion every 21 days) and olaparib (150 mg twice daily continuously).

    "abstract": "Over the past decade, immunotherapeutic strategies-mainly targeting the PD-1-PD-L1 immune checkpoint axis-have altered cancer treatment for many solid tumours, but few patients with gastrointestinal forms of cancer have benefited to date. There remains an urgent need to extend immunotherapy efficacy to more patients while addressing resistance to current immune checkpoint inhibitors. The aim of this study was to determine the safety and anti-tumour activity of knockout of CISH, which encodes cytokine-inducible SH2-containing protein, a novel intracellular immune checkpoint target and a founding member of the SOCS family of E3-ligases, using tumour infiltrating lymphocyte (TILs) genetically edited with CRISPR-Cas9 in patients with metastatic gastrointestinal epithelial cancers. For this first-in-human, single-centre, phase 1 trial, patients aged 18-70 years with a diagnosis of metastatic gastrointestinal epithelial cancer with progressive disease following at least one first line standard therapy, measurable disease with at least one lesion identified as resectable for TIL generation and at least one other lesion meeting RECIST criteria as measurable to serve as an indicator of disease response, and an ECOG performance status of 0 or 1 were screened and enrolled if meeting these and all other eligibility criteria. TILs procured from tumour biopsies were expanded on the basis of neoantigen reactivity, subjected to CRISPR-Cas9-mediated CISH knockout, and infused intravenously into 12 patients after non-myeloablative lymphocyte depleting chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide 60 mg/kg per dose on study days -6 and -5, and fludarabine 25 mg/m Between May 12, 2020, and Sept 16, 2022, 22 participants were enrolled in the trial (one patient was enrolled twice owing to lack of TIL outgrowth on the first attempt); ten patients were female, and 11 were male (self-defined). One patient was Asian, the remainder were White (self-defined). We successfully manufactured CISH knockout TIL products for 19 (86%) of the patients, of whom 12 (63%) received autologous CISH knockout TIL infusion. The median follow-up time for the study was 129 days (IQR 15-283). All 12 (100%) patients had treatment-related severe adverse events. The most common grade 3-4 adverse events included haematological events (12 patients [100%]) attributable to the preparative lymphodepleting chemotherapy regimen or expected effects of IL-2, fatigue (four patients [33%]), and anorexia (three patients [25%]). Deaths of any cause for patients on study were attributed to the underlying disease under study (metastatic gastrointestinal cancer) and related complications (10 patients) or infection (grade 5 septicaemia in one patient). There were no severe (≥grade 3) cytokine release or neurotoxicity events. Six (50%) of 12 patients had stable disease by day 28, and four (33%) had stable disease ongoing at 56 days. One young adult patient with microsatellite-instability-high colorectal cancer refractory to anti-PD1/CTLA-4 therapies had a complete and ongoing response (>21 months). These results support the safety and potential antitumour activity of inhibiting the immune checkpoint CISH through the administration of neoantigen-reactive CISH-knockout TILs, with implications for patients with advanced metastatic cancers refractory to checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapies, and provide the first evidence that a novel intracellular checkpoint can be targeted with therapeutic effect.

    "abstract": "The VISION trial of tepotinib, a selective MET inhibitor, enrolled patients with non-small cell lung cancer and prospectively detected MET exon 14 (METex14) skipping in liquid biopsies (LBx) and/or tissue biopsies (TBx). We evaluated patient characteristics and outcomes according to METex14 positivity in LBx (LBx-positive) or TBx (TBx-positive). METex14 was centrally assessed by next-generation sequencing of ctDNA from LBx (Guardant360/ArcherMET) and/or RNA from TBx (Oncomine Focus/ArcherMET) or, in Japan only, local TBx PCR. Parallel LBx/TBx testing was recommended but not mandatory. Eligibility required LBx-positive or TBx-positive status. ctDNA burden was analyzed in patients with baseline Guardant360 data. METex14 was detected in 469 of 7,937 prescreened/screened patients, 313 of whom were enrolled (TBx-positive, n = 208; LBx-positive, n = 178). LBx-positive patients had higher radiographic tumor burden than TBx-positive patients, including higher median sum of target lesion diameters per RECIST v1.1 (67.1 vs. 55.2 mm) and more patients with ≥3 target lesions (27.5% vs. 18.8%). In 180 TBx-positive patients with matching LBx results, objective response rates were slightly higher in TBx-positive/LBx-positive patients, but TBx-positive/LBx-negative patients had longer duration of response, progression-free survival, and overall survival. In ctDNA analysis (n = 165), detectable baseline ctDNA burden was associated with shorter progression-free survival and overall survival. Tepotinib had robust, durable activity in TBx-positive/LBx-negative and TBx-positive/LBx-positive patients. Although LBx is a complementary method to TBx for detecting METex14, it may preferentially select patients with higher tumor burden and poorer prognosis. Undetectable METex14 in baseline ctDNA (due to low ctDNA shedding) may define more favorable treatment outcomes.",

There were more adverse events, particularly infusion reactions, in the combination arms than the Pac arm. Expansion of peripheral T-cell clones was observed by cycle 4 in Pac/Pel but not the Pac or Pac/Pel/Ave arms. The addition of Pel to Pac was associated with increased toxicity, expanded peripheral T-cell clones, and numerically increased the ORR and progression-free survival compared with Pac; Pac/Pel/Ave further increased toxicity and blunted T-cell responses without obvious increase in efficacy. Investigation of the Pac/Pel combination warrants consideration with careful attention to acute toxicity.",

    "title": "Adaptive Therapy Exploits Fitness Deficits in Chemotherapy-Resistant Ovarian Cancer to Achieve Long-Term Tumor Control.",
    "abstract": "Drug resistance results in poor outcomes for patients with cancer. Adaptive therapy is a potential strategy to address drug resistance that exploits competitive interactions between sensitive and resistant subclones. In this study, we showed that adapting carboplatin dose according to tumor response (adaptive therapy) significantly prolonged survival of murine ovarian cancer models compared with standard carboplatin dosing, without increasing mean daily drug dose or toxicity. Platinum-resistant ovarian cancer cells exhibited diminished fitness when drug was absent in vitro and in vivo, which caused selective decline of resistant populations due to reduced proliferation and increased apoptosis. Conversely, fitter, sensitive cells regrew when drug was withdrawn. Using a bioinformatics pipeline that exploits copy number changes to quantify the emergence of treatment resistance, analysis of cell-free DNA obtained longitudinally from patients with ovarian cancer during treatment showed subclonal selection through therapy, and measurements of resistant population growth correlated strongly with disease burden. These preclinical findings pave the way for future clinical testing of personalized adaptive therapy regimens tailored to the evolution of carboplatin resistance in individual patients with ovarian cancer. Carboplatin adaptive therapy improves treatment efficacy without increasing daily dose due to reduced fitness of drug-resistant populations, which can be tracked using cfDNA and could direct adaptive therapy in future clinical trials.

    "abstract": "Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) holds promise as an early endpoint to predict overall survival (OS). The creation and structured interrogation of aggregated datasets inform the hypothesis that ctDNA is reasonably likely to predict treatment benefit. Friends of Cancer Research convened a diverse working group to establish and implement an analysis plan assessing patient-level associations between changes in ctDNA levels with OS and progression-free survival (PFS). The aggregate dataset included eight clinical trials representing 940 patients with biomarker-positive advanced non-small cell lung cancer treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Detection of baseline and on-treatment ctDNA was assessed for associations with OS and PFS. Additionally, combinations of ctDNA detection and RECIST measurements up to 10 weeks on treatment were considered. Patients with detected ctDNA at baseline that became nondetected on treatment (\"clearance\") experienced improved OS compared with patients with persistently detected ctDNA (adjusted HR = 2.12, P < 0.001). This pattern was also seen in the subset of patients with stable disease as measured by RECIST within 10 weeks of treatment initiation (adjusted HR = 4.15, P < 0.001). Results were similar for PFS. In patients with oncogene-driven advanced non-small cell lung cancer treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors, ctDNA clearance within 10 weeks of treatment initiation was associated with improved OS and PFS. These patient-level results support the growing evidence that demonstrates a change in ctDNA levels during treatment is associated with clinical benefit. Future prospective trials should include predefined thresholds of molecular response to advance the utility of ctDNA as an early endpoint.",

    "abstract": "The discovery that cyclin E overexpression is a key cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4/6 inhibitor resistance mechanism has reinvigorated interest in targeting CDK2 and the simultaneous inhibition of CDK2/4/6 as a novel therapeutic approach. This first-in-human study assessed the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and efficacy of PF-06873600, the first-in-class inhibitor of CDK2/4/6. Dose escalation included 78 patients with advanced breast cancer, triple-negative breast cancer, or ovarian cancer who received oral PF-06873600 at doses ranging from 1 to 50 mg twice daily (part 1A, n = 51) or PF-06873600 with endocrine therapy (part 1B, n = 16; part 1C, n = 11) to determine the recommended dose for expansion (RDE). Dose expansion (part 2A, n = 45; part 2C, n = 28) assessed preliminary antitumor activity, safety, and tolerability at the RDE in combination with fulvestrant in patients with hormone receptor+/HER2- metastatic breast cancer. Pharmacodynamics and translational readouts were assessed by measuring phosphorylated Rb and Ki67 in tumor biopsies and ctDNA. The RDE of PF-06873600 was 25 mg twice daily. During dose escalation, 6 of 42 (14.3%) evaluable patients had treatment-related dose-limiting toxicities. The most common all-causality adverse events (N = 151) were nausea (62.9%), anemia (44.4%), and fatigue (43.7%). Reductions in Ki67-positive cells, phosphorylated Rb histo-score, and ctDNA levels were observed. Three RECIST partial responses (PR) were observed in part 1. In part 2A, there were three PRs (objective response rate, 6.7%; 95% confidence interval, 1.4%-18.3%), and in part 2C, there were five PRs (objective response rate, 22.7%; 95% confidence interval, 7.8%-45.4%). PF-06873600 demonstrated a benefit-risk profile consistent with the CDK4/6 inhibitor class of drugs, with preliminary clinical activity in hormone receptor+/HER2- metastatic breast cancer.",

    "abstract": "Patients with unresectable intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) have poor overall survival (OS). Hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) and transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), including conventional TACE (c-TACE) and drug-eluting bead TACE (DEB-TACE), are widely used to treat ICC, but the efficacy of these therapies has not been fully demonstrated. This study aimed to compare the efficacy of HAIC and TACE in unresectable ICC patients. This retrospective cohort study included unresectable ICC patients who received HAIC, c-TACE or DEB-TACE as initial treatment between June 2016 and October 2023 at three hospitals. The median OS (mOS), tumor response, and incidence of adverse events (AEs) were compared and propensity score matching (PSM) was used to reduce selection bias. A total of 181 patients with unresectable ICC received HAIC (n = 24), c-TACE (n = 73) and DEB-TACE (n = 84). The HAIC group had significantly higher mOS (10.3 vs. 5.1 months, p = 0.0042), objective response rate (ORR) (29.2% vs. 4.1%, p = 0.002) and disease control rate (DCR) (95.8% vs. 43.8%, p < 0.001) than the c-TACE group. There was no significant difference between the HAIC and DEB-TACE groups in improving mOS (10.3 vs. 12.5 months, p = 0.61). Results remained consistent after PSM. The c-TACE and DEB-TACE groups had a higher incidence of AEs compared with the HAIC group. After matching, there was no significant difference in the incidence of AEs between groups. HAIC improves ICC patient prognosis better than c-TACE. Both HAIC and DEB-TACE are superior treatment options for unresectable ICC. Question The evidence of comparative effectiveness between hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) and transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is insufficient. Findings HAIC significantly improved median overall survival, tumor response, and prognosis while reducing adverse events compared to convention TACE (c-TACE) in unresectable intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) patients. Clinical relevance HAIC significantly improves OS and tumor response in patients with unresectable ICC compared to c-TACE, but HAIC shows no significant difference from drug-eluting bead-TACE. Notably, HAIC shows no significant difference in adverse events compared to both c-TACE and DEB-TACE.",

    "abstract": "This study aims to develop a short-term spatiotemporal CT radiomics model to predict the major pathological response (MPR) to neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy (NCI) in NSCLC by decoding the intra- and peri-tumoral imaging phenotypes. A total of 352 patients undergoing curative surgery following NCI for NSCLC were enrolled from two centers, forming a training cohort (n = 186), an internal validation cohort (n = 80), and an external validation cohort (n = 86). Intra- and peri-tumoral CT radiomics features were computed to capture imaging phenotypes of the tumor microenvironment. Delta radiomics features were also calculated by quantifying changes in each radiomics feature. A support vector machine classifier was utilized to develop the short-term spatiotemporal model by analyzing changes in radiomics features. The multi-timepoint short-term spatiotemporal model, incorporating pre-treatment, post-treatment and delta radiomic features, achieved AUC values of 0.84, 0.77, and 0.75 in the training, internal validation, and external validation cohorts, respectively. These results significantly outperformed the RECIST model and pre-treatment model, with p-values < 0.05 indicating statistical significance. This study demonstrates that short-term temporal analysis of intra- and peri-tumoral CT radiomics is a promising approach for predicting MPR to NCI in NSCLC. These findings underscore the potential of radiomics as a non-invasive tool for assessing treatment response and guiding personalized therapy in NSCLC patients. Question Neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy has improved in major pathological response rate for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), but it is unclear which patients will benefit most. Findings The multi-timepoint short-term spatiotemporal model based on CT pictures demonstrates high predictive performance for assessing major pathological response following neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy in NSCLC.

    "abstract": "There is no approved maintenance therapy in advanced non-adipocytic soft tissue sarcomas (STS). We explore here the role of regorafenib as a potential maintenance therapy after first-line treatment. EREMISS (NCT03793361) was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, comparative, 1 : 1 randomised phase II trial assessing the activity and safety of regorafenib (120 mg/day, 3 weeks on/1 week off) in patients with non-adipocytic STS, who had stable disease or partial response after six cycles of doxorubicin-based chemotherapy as first-line treatment of advanced disease. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) according to RECIST 1.1 evaluated by blinded central review. Based on the following assumptions: PFS (placebo) = 4 months, expected PFS (regorafenib) = 7 months, hazard ratio (HR) = 0.57, one-sided α = 0.05 and β = 0.10, 110 events and 126 patients were required. This study was supported by French National Cancer Institute, a patient advocacy group and Bayer HealthCare. The study population consisted of 126 patients enrolled in 17 centres from May 2019 to November 2022. Female patients accounted for 55% of total enrolment. The median age was 58 years (range 18-85 years). The most common histological subtype was leiomyosarcoma (59%). The primary objective was assessable in 122 patients (109 events). Median PFS by blinded central review was 3.5 (placebo) versus 5.6 months (regorafenib) (HR = 0.53, 95% CI 0.36-0.78; P = 0.001). Median overall survival was 20.5 versus 27.6 months (HR = 0.78, 95% CI 0.50-1.22, P = 0.28). The proportion of patients with grade ≥3 adverse events was 4.8% (placebo) versus 56.3% (regorafenib). The most common grade ≥3 clinical adverse events in the regorafenib arm were asthenia (9%), arterial hypertension (8%), and rash (8%). This trial met its primary objective, regorafenib significantly delayed disease progression after first-line treatment in advanced non-adipocytic STS.

    "abstract": "The liver is a common site for metastatic spread, especially in advanced colorectal, breast, and pancreatic cancers. Imaging evaluation of liver metastases after systemic treatments like chemotherapy, targeted therapy, or immunotherapy is essential to distinguish treatment response from disease progression. The widely used response evaluation criteria in solid tumours (RECIST 1.1) focus on lesion size changes to evaluate treatment response. However, newer therapies, mainly targeted therapy and immunotherapy, often induce changes beyond size reduction, such as tumour necrosis, fibrosis, cystic transformation, calcifications, and modifications at the liver-tumour interface. These morphological and enhancement changes can be evaluated on CT and MRI and may better reflect the biological response in specific clinical settings. Overall, RECIST 1.1 criteria are recommended for assessing the radiological response of liver metastases after systemic treatment. The use of alternative radiological criteria validated on CT (such as Chun or Choi criteria) is recommended in specific clinical settings (e.g. metastatic colorectal cancer or metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumours). Additionally, CT and MR modifications that reflect fibrosis, necrosis, calcifications, and haemorrhage can serve as ancillary indicators of tumoural response. These alternative criteria and radiological findings should be systematically assessed, particularly in liver metastases with minimal size changes, to better identify responders. KEY POINTS: RECIST 1.1 is the standard for evaluating tumour response in solid tumours and is recommended for the assessment of liver metastases after systemic therapy. CT attenuation, enhancement, and liver/tumour interface may correlate better with tumoural response compared to size reduction. CT and MR changes suggesting necrosis, fibrosis, calcifications, and haemorrhage can be used as additional indicators of tumoural response.",

This was a phase I, first-in-human, dose escalation/expansion study in patients with progressive mCRPC after treatment with ≥one androgen signaling inhibitors (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03575819). The starting dose of FOR46 was 0.1 mg/kg given intravenously every 3 weeks. The primary objective was to determine the maximally tolerated dose (MTD).

We present patient-reported outcomes (PROs) from LITESPARK-005. LITESPARK-005 was an open-label, multicentre, randomised, active-controlled phase 3 trial conducted at 147 hospitals and cancer centres in six regions. Eligible participants were 18 years or older with advanced clear cell renal cell carcinoma, had a Karnofsky Performance Status score of 70% or higher, had measurable disease per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST) version 1.1, had disease progression on or after treatment with anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy and a VEGF tyrosine kinase inhibitor (in sequence or in combination), and had received no more than three previous systemic lines of therapy. Eligible participants were randomly assigned (1:1) centrally using interactive voice-response and web-response systems to receive either belzutifan 120 mg orally once daily or everolimus 10 mg orally once daily. Randomisation was stratified by International Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma Database Consortium prognostic score and number of previous VEGF-targeted or VEGF receptor-targeted therapies. The dual primary outcomes were progression-free survival and overall survival, results of which have been reported previously. In this study, prespecified secondary patient-reported outcomes (PROs) from LITESPARK-005 were assessed using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Kidney Cancer Symptom Index: Disease Related Symptoms (FKSI-DRS) and the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30). The PRO analysis population included all participants who received at least one dose of study therapy and completed at least one PRO assessment. Least-squares mean change from baseline in PROs at week 17 was assessed using a constrained longitudinal data analysis model. Time to deterioration in physical functioning (prespecified) and role functioning (post hoc), as assessed by the EORTC QLQ-C30, were also evaluated in the PRO analysis population. This trial is ongoing, closed to recruitment, and registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04195750. Between March 10, 2020, and Jan 19, 2022, 996 participants were screened for eligibility and 746 participants were randomly assigned to belzutifan (n=374) or everolimus (n=372). The PRO full analysis set population included 366 participants in the belzutifan group and 354 in the everolimus group. Median time from randomisation to the database cutoff date (June 13, 2023) was 25·7 months (IQR 21·7-30·4). Completion rates for FKSI-DRS and QLQ-C30 were higher than 94% at baseline and higher than 55% at week 17 in each group. Change from baseline to week 17 in FKSI-DRS score (difference in least-squares mean between groups 1·5 [95% CI 0·7 to 2·2]) and QLQ-C30 global health status-quality of life (QOL) score (6·4 [3·2 to 9·6]) suggested stability with belzutifan versus worsening with everolimus. Change from baseline to week 17 was similar between groups for QLQ-C30 physical functioning (difference in least-squares mean 2·5 [95% CI -0·6 to 5·5]) and QLQ-C30 role functioning (4·2 [0·1 to 8·4]) subscale scores. Time to deterioration was similar between the belzutifan and everolimus groups for EORTC physical functioning (median 19·3 months [95% CI 11·1 to not reached] in the belzutifan group vs 13·8 months [10·6 to not reached] in the everolimus group; hazard ratio 0·93 [95% CI 0·72 to 1·20]) and role functioning (median 12·0 months [9·2 to not reached] vs 10·2 months [4·7 to 14·4]; 0·88 [0·69 to 1·11]). Belzutifan for advanced renal cell carcinoma was associated with improved disease-specific symptoms and QOL compared with everolimus. Taken together with the efficacy and safety data from LITESPARK-005, belzutifan could offer a clinical benefit without compromising the QOL of patients in this setting.

    "abstract": "To evaluate the clinical value of dual-energy CT (DECT) parameters in estimating tumor regression grade (TRG) of gastric cancer after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). In this retrospective study, the patients with pathologically confirmed gastric cancer were classified into two groups based on TRG results: the effective group and the ineffective group. DECT parameters, including iodine concentration (IC), normalized iodine concentration (NIC), and slope of the energy spectrum curve (λ), were obtained. Quantitative parameters and their change rates were compared before and after chemotherapy. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were plotted. A total of 54 patients were included and divided into the effective group (n = 21) and the ineffective group (n = 33). After NAC, the change rates of parameters in the venous phase (%ΔIC-v, %ΔNIC-v, and %Δλ-v) were notably higher in the effective group were higher than in the ineffective group (all p < 0.05). The consistency between the response evaluation criteria in solid tumors version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) and TRG was fair, with a Kappa value of 0.299 (p < 0.05). The %ΔIC-v, %ΔIC-d, %ΔNIC-v, %ΔNIC-d, and %Δλ-v exhibited moderate or strong correlations with TRG, with correlation coefficients (r) of -0.624, -0.475, -0.766, -0.516, and -0.431, respectively (all p < 0.05). %ΔNIC-v achieved a significantly greater area under the curve (AUC) compared to RECIST 1.1 (AUC, 0.877; 95% CI: 0.772-0.957; vs AUC, 0.649; 95% CI: 0.496-0.803; p < 0.05) for estimating TRG in gastric cancer. DECT parameters, particularly %ΔNIC-v, show promise in assessing the efficacy of NAC for gastric cancer. Question Two-dimensional morphological change is insufficient for accurately assessing the pathological TRG following NAC in gastric cancer. Findings DECT parameters show higher preoperative predictive efficacy than RECIST 1.1 for TRG in gastric cancer. Clinical relevance DECT-derived quantitative parameters offer a reliable and noninvasive tool for the preoperative prediction of pathological response in gastric cancer patients undergoing NAC.",

This phase II, randomized, multicentre trial evaluated the safety and activity of the anti-PD-L1 antibody atezolizumab (atezo) combined with the VEGF inhibitor bevacizumab (bev) and the irreversible cyclooxygenase 1/2 inhibitor aspirin [acetylsalicylic acid (ASA)] in PROC. Patients were randomized to bev monotherapy 15 mg/kg (arm 1), atezo 1,200 mg plus placebo (pbo; arm 2), atezo 1,200 mg plus ASA 320 mg/daily (arm 3), bev 15 mg/kg plus atezo 1,200 mg plus pbo (arm 4), or bev 15 mg/kg plus atezo 1,200 mg plus ASA 320 mg/daily (arm 5). Primary endpoint was progression-free survival at 6 months (PFS-6) according to RECIST v1.1 assessed by a local investigator. Secondary objectives included overall survival, PFS, second PFS (PFS2), and tolerability. Time to first subsequent therapy (TFST) was evaluated in a post hoc analysis. In arms 1 (bev), 4 (bev-atezo-pbo), and 5 (bev-atezo-ASA), there were 7/32 [21.9%, 70% confidence interval (CI), 14.0-32.0], 8/32 (25.0%, 70% CI, 16.6-35.3), and 8/32 (25.0%, 70% CI, 16.6-35.3) patients alive and progression-free at 6 months. The primary objective was not reached in any arm. Median PFS and response rates were 2.3 for bev monotherapy, 4.1 for bev-atezo-pbo, and 4.0 months for bev-atezo-ASA and 10%, 19%, and 15%, respectively. Two patients achieved an ongoing complete response lasting for more than 5 years from randomization (1 in bev-atezo-pbo and 1 in bev-atezo-ASA). A post hoc analysis of TFST suggested benefit of adding bev to atezo-ASA (P < 0.001). Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) increased in the atezo-containing arms after the first two cycles, and increased TIL were associated with a significantly longer TFST. The addition of ASA to bev plus atezo was well-tolerated but did not improve efficacy in PROC. Relative to bev alone, the bev plus atezo combination numerically improved PFS. Exploratory translational analyses suggest clinical benefit in a subgroup of patients characterized by high TIL infiltration and PD-L1-positive tumors at baseline.",

    "abstract": "CB307 is a trispecific variable heavy-chain antibody fragment against prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA), CD137, and human serum albumin. It is designed to mitigate hepatotoxicity by activating T cells only in PSMA-positive tumors and to increase drug half-life through albumin binding. This phase I study investigated the safety and tolerability of CB307 as monotherapy or in combination with pembrolizumab. Patients who were heavily pretreated with PSMA-positive solid tumors were enrolled in the dose-escalation phase of CB307 monotherapy. The additional safety and efficacy of CB307 were assessed in the CB307 monotherapy expansion cohort and in combination with pembrolizumab. CB307 was administered to 75 patients. CB307 was given once every 7 days as monotherapy (N = 50) or in combination with pembrolizumab (N = 25). Two dose-limiting toxicities (grade 3 transient transaminitis) were observed. A total of three grade 3 transaminitis events (one in the monotherapy cohort and two in the combination cohort) were observed, and none involved bilirubin elevation. Durable RECIST responses were observed in two patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer enrolled in the 800 mg CB307 monotherapy and in one patient in the combination cohort (overall response rates: 11.1% and 7.1%, respectively). A disease control rate (DCR) of 50% was observed in patients enrolled in the 800 mg CB307 monotherapy cohort and 42.9% in the combination cohort. In a post hoc analysis, the response was numerically better in patients who had not received chemotherapy in the 6 months prior to starting CB307 (ORR = 20%, DCR = 60% vs. ORR = 0%, DCR = 37.5%). CB307 induces cytotoxic cell expansion in tumors and PD-L1 expression. CB307 was well tolerated as a monotherapy and in combination with pembrolizumab, and tumor responses were observed in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.

We present integrated data of entrectinib in children with NTRK or ROS1 fusion-positive tumours from the STARTRK-NG, TAPISTRY, and STARTRK-2 trials. Efficacy analyses were undertaken on TRK/ROS1 inhibitor-naïve patients aged <18 years with metastatic/locally advanced NTRK1/2/3 or ROS1 fusion-positive extracranial solid or CNS tumours who received ≥1 entrectinib dose and had ≥6 months of follow-up from enrolment. Tumour responses were confirmed by blinded independent central review (BICR) per RECIST v1.1/RANO criteria. BICR-assessed confirmed objective response rate (cORR). Key secondary endpoints: duration of response (DoR); time to response (TtR); safety. As of 16 July 2023, out of 91 safety-evaluable patients, 64 (NTRK: n=44; ROS1: n=20) were efficacy evaluable. In the NTRK and ROS1 subgroups, respectively, median age was 4.0 years and 7.5 years; median survival follow-up was 24.2 months and 27.6 months. cORR was 72.7 % (NTRK, 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 57.2-85.0) and 65.0 % (ROS1, 95 % CI: 40.8-84.6).

Neoadjuvant nivolumab plus chemotherapy followed by response-stratified de-escalated chemoradiation therapy (CRT) in HPV-negative LA stage IVa/b HNSCC may improve treatment efficacy while reducing treatment-related toxic effects. To determine the deep response rate and tolerability of neoadjuvant nivolumab plus chemotherapy followed by response-stratified CRT in nonvirally mediated stage IVa/b HNSCC. In this investigator-initiated phase 2 nonrandomized clinical trial conducted at a single academic center, patients with stage IVa/b (American Joint Committee on Cancer Tumor Classification, 8th edition) HPV-negative LA HNSCC were enrolled between 2019 and 2022. Data were analyzed from February 2023 to January 2024. The DEPEND trial evaluated neoadjuvant nivolumab plus carboplatin and paclitaxel, followed by response-stratified CRT. Patients with 50% or greater reduction per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 received de-escalated CRT to 66 Gy with elimination of elective nodal volumes; patients with less than 50% reduction received standard CRT to 70 to 75 Gy. Adjuvant nivolumab was administered for 9 cycles. The primary end point was deep response rate (DRR; 50% or greater shrinkage per RECIST version 1.1) following neoadjuvant nivolumab plus chemotherapy. Secondary end points included progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), locoregional control, and distant control. Exploratory end points included acute toxic effects in patients who received response-adapted de-escalated CRT. Of 36 included patients, 28 (78%) were male, and the median (range) age was 58.9 (27-77) years. All patients started treatment and were available for analysis. The median (range) follow-up was 20 (13-40) months. The primary end point was met, with a DRR following neoadjuvant nivolumab/chemotherapy of 53% (95% CI, 35-70). The objective response rate was 86% (95% CI, 71-95). A total of 19 received de-escalated CRT and 16 received standard CRT. PFS and OS at 2 years were 66% (95% CI, 34-76) and 73% (95% CI, 52-86), respectively. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events for de-escalated and standard CRT were mucositis (14 of 19 [74%] and 15 of 16 [94%], respectively), radiation dermatitis (13 of 19 [68%] and 14 of 16 [88%], respectively), and dry mouth (7 of 19 [37%] and 10 of 16 [63%], respectively). In this phase 2 nonrandomized clinical trial, neoadjuvant nivolumab/chemotherapy led to deep responses in 53% of patients with HPV-negative LA stage IVa/b HNSCC, and response-adapted de-escalated CRT led to favorable survival with lower acute toxic effects among deep responders.

    "title": "Enhancing the role of MRI in rectal cancer: advances from staging to prognosis prediction.",
    "abstract": "Rectal cancer (RC) is one of the major health challenges worldwide. Accurate staging, restaging, invasiveness assessment, and treatment efficacy evaluation are crucial for its clinical management. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) plays a significant role in these processes. However, standard MRI techniques, including T2-weighted and diffusion-weighted imaging, have uncertainties in identifying early-stage tumors, high-risk nodules, extramural vascular invasion, and treatment efficacy, potentially leading to inappropriate treatment. Recent advances suggest that the integration of traditional MRI methods, including diffusion-weighted imaging, opposed-phase or contrast-enhanced T1-weighted imaging, as well as emerging synthetic MRI, could address these challenges. Additionally, improvements in imaging technology have spurred research into advanced functional MRI techniques such as diffusion kurtosis imaging and amide proton transfer weighted MRI, yielding promising results in RC assessment. Total neoadjuvant therapy has emerged as a new treatment paradigm for locally advanced RC, with neoadjuvant immunotherapy and chemotherapy offering viable alternatives to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. However, the lack of standards for the early prediction of patient survival and tumor response to neoadjuvant therapy highlights a critical unmet need in matching therapies to suitable patients. Furthermore, organ preservation strategies after neoadjuvant therapy provide personalized options based on tumor response and patient preferences, yet traditional MRI assessments show significant variability. Radiomics and artificial intelligence hold promise for revealing complex patterns in MRI images associated with patient prognosis and treatment response. This review provides an overview of current MRI advancements in RC assessment and emphasizes how future research can refine tailored treatment strategies to improve patient outcomes. KEY POINTS: Question The accurate diagnosis of early-stage rectal tumors, high-risk nodules, treatment responses, and the early prediction of patient survival and therapeutic outcomes remain an unmet need. Findings Visual MRI has improved staging, restaging, and invasiveness evaluation. Advanced MRI, radiomics and artificial intelligence provide significant potential for tumor characterization and outcome prediction. Clinical relevance Advances in visual MRI are improving routine imaging protocols and radiomics and artificial intelligence show promise in enhancing treatment decisions through precise tumor characterization and outcome prediction.",

VEGF signaling causes immune evasion and immune suppression within the tumor. We evaluated the anti-PD-L1 antibody atezolizumab and anti-VEGF antibody bevacizumab for patients with unresectable, advanced anal cancer. For this phase II study, participants with previously treated, immunotherapy-naïve anal cancer received atezolizumab (1,200 mg) and bevacizumab (15 mg/kg) intravenously every 21 days. Responses were evaluated every 9 weeks (RECIST version 1.1). The primary endpoint was the best radiographic response. Median survival was estimated by Kaplan-Meier and compared for selected biomarkers (including paired pre- and on-treatment biopsies) using a log-rank test. Among 20 participants, the overall response rate was 11% [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.2-32]. Median progression-free survival and overall survival were 4.1 months (95% CI, 2.6-not assessable) and 11.6 months (95% CI, 9.5-20), respectively.

In this study, we uncovered a positive correlation between the presence of pericytes in the tumor-associated vasculature and TNFα-induced leakage and drug delivery, especially when drugs were encapsulated in nanoparticles. RNA sequencing and pathway analysis identified high expression of C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 10 (CXCL10) in TNFα-stimulated pericytes. In addition, TNFα increased CXCL10 protein production by pericytes in vitro. In animal studies, tumor types with vessels with high pericyte coverage showed enhanced permeability and extravasation of drugs encapsulated in nanoparticles following treatment with TNFα, which could be blocked with a CXCL10-neutralizing antibody. In contrast, tumors harboring vessels with low pericyte numbers did not display increased drug extravasation in response to TNFα. Lack of pericyte coverage could be compensated by coadministration of CXCL10. These findings reveal a mechanism by which TNFα induces CXCL10 release from pericytes, resulting in increased endothelial permeability, vascular leakage, and drug delivery. Significance: TNFα stimulates tumor-associated pericytes to produce CXCL10 that mediates vascular leakage and assists in the intratumoral delivery of nanoparticle-encapsulated chemotherapeutic drugs.",

    "abstract": "The COSMIC-021 study assessed the safety and efficacy of cabozantinib plus atezolizumab in advanced solid tumors. Presented here are results from the expansion cohorts with advanced urothelial carcinoma (UC). This phase Ib study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03170960) enrolled patients with inoperable locally advanced/metastatic UC into four tumor cohorts: first-line cisplatin-eligible (cis-eligible), first-line cisplatin-ineligible (cis-ineligible), previous platinum-containing chemotherapy (previous chemotherapy-treated), and previous immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)-treated. Patients received oral cabozantinib 40 mg once daily and intravenous atezolizumab 1,200 mg once every 3 weeks. The primary end point was objective response rate (ORR), as assessed by the investigator per RECIST v1.1 every 6 weeks for 12 months and every 12 weeks thereafter; the secondary end point was safety. A total of 121 patients (previous ICI-treated cohort, n = 31, and each of the other cohorts, n = 30) received study treatment from March 2018 to November 2021. The ORR (95% CI) was 30% (15 to 49) for cis-eligible, 20% (8 to 39) for cis-ineligible, 27% (12 to 46) for previous chemotherapy-treated, and 10% (2 to 26) for previous ICI-treated cohorts. The median progression-free survival (95% CI) was 5.5 (1.6 to 11.6), 5.6 (3.1 to 11.1), 5.4 (1.6 to 7.6), and 3.0 (1.8 to 5.5) months, respectively. Grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) were experienced by 43%, 67%, 57%, and 45% of patients, respectively. TRAEs led to discontinuation of all treatment components in 17%, 13%, 3%, and 19%, respectively. No grade 5 TRAEs were reported in any cohort. The novel combination of cabozantinib plus atezolizumab exhibited clinical activity in advanced UC that is cis-eligible, cis-ineligible, or previously treated with platinum-containing chemotherapy; clinical activity in previous ICI-treated UC was modest. The toxicity profile was consistent with that previously reported for the combination.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate whole-tumor histogram analysis of diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI), intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM), and dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) in predicting the efficacy of imatinib, a c-KIT inhibitor, for treating patient-derived models derived from sinonasal mucosal melanomas (MM). This study included 38 patients with histologically confirmed sinonasal MM, who underwent DKI, IVIM, and DCE-MRI. Patient-derived tumor xenograft models and precision-cut tumor slices were established to evaluate tumor response to imatinib. Whole-tumor histogram analysis was conducted on imaging parameters, and logistic regression models were applied to determine the predictive value of these metrics in differentiating responders from nonresponders. Among the 38 patients with sinonasal MM, 12 were classified as responders and 26 as nonresponders based on patient-derived tumor xenograft and precision-cut tumor slice model responses to imatinib. The DKI model revealed significant differences in mean, median, 10th percentile, and 90th percentile values of Dk and K between responders and nonresponders (P < 0.05). The IVIM model indicated significant differences in 10th percentile and mean values of D, with kurtosis f being a strong predictor. The DCE-MRI model, using the 90th percentile Ktrans metric, demonstrated robust predictive performance, achieving an AUC of 0.89, with 80.77% specificity and 91.67% sensitivity. The combined logistic model integrating DKI, IVIM, and DCE-MRI metrics produced the highest predictive accuracy, with an AUC of 0.90. Whole-tumor histogram analysis of DKI, IVIM, and DCE-MRI offers a noninvasive method for predicting the efficacy of c-KIT inhibitors in sinonasal MMs, presenting valuable implications for guiding targeted treatment in this rare cancer type.",

    "abstract": "In the ARIEL4 trial of rucaparib versus standard-of-care chemotherapy in patients with relapsed BRCA-mutated ovarian carcinoma, the primary endpoint was met, showing improved investigator-assessed progression-free survival with rucaparib. Here, we present the final overall survival analysis of the trial and other post-progression outcomes. This open-label, randomised, controlled phase 3 trial was done at 64 hospitals and cancer centres in 12 countries, including Brazil, Canada, Czech Republic, Hungary, Israel, Italy, Poland, Russia, Spain, Ukraine, the UK, and the USA. Eligible patients were women aged 18 or older with BRCA1 or BRCA2-mutated ovarian carcinoma and had received at least two previous chemotherapy regimens. Patients had to have evaluable disease as per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST; version 1.1) criteria and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1. Patients were randomly assigned (2:1) using an interactive response technology and block randomisation (block size of six) and stratified by progression-free interval after the most recent platinum-containing therapy to receive oral rucaparib (600 mg twice daily administered in 28-day cycles) or chemotherapy on the basis of platinum-sensitivity status. In the chemotherapy group, patients with platinum-resistant disease (progression-free interval ≥1 to <6 months) or partially platinum-sensitive disease (progression-free interval ≥6 to <12 months) received weekly paclitaxel (starting dose 60-80 mg/m Between March 1, 2017, and Sept 24, 2020, 349 eligible patients were randomly assigned to receive rucaparib (n=233) or chemotherapy (n=116). 332 (95%) of 349 patients were white and 17 (5%) patients were other or of unknown race. In the chemotherapy group, 80 (69%) of 116 patients crossed over to receive rucaparib. Median follow-up was 41·2 months (IQR 37·8-44·6). At data cutoff for this final analysis (April 10, 2022), 244 (70%) of 349 patients had died: 167 (72%) of 233 in the rucaparib group and 77 (66%) of 116 in the rucaparib group. Median overall survival was 19·4 months (95% CI 15·2-23·6) in the rucaparib group versus 25·4 months (21·4-27·6) in the chemotherapy group (hazard ratio 1·3 [95% CI 1·0-1·7], p=0·047). No new safety signals were observed, including during crossover to rucaparib. The most common grade 3-4 adverse events across treatment groups included anaemia or decreased haemoglobin (reported in 59 [25%] of 232 patients in the rucaparib group and seven [6%] of 113 in the chemotherapy group), and neutropenia or decreased neutrophil count (in 26 [11%] of 232 in the rucaparib group and 16 [14%] of 113 patients in the chemotherapy group). Serious adverse events were reported in 66 (28%) of 232 patients in the rucaparib group and 14 (12%) of 113 patients in the chemotherapy group. Ten treatment-related deaths were reported in the rucaparib group, two of which were linked to judged to be related to rucaparib (cardiac disorder and myelodysplastic syndrome), and one death related to treatment was reported in the chemotherapy group, with no specific cause linked to the treatment. These data highlight the need for a better understanding of the most appropriate treatment for patients who have progressed on a poly(adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor, and the optimal sequencing of chemotherapy and PARP inhibitors in advanced ovarian cancer.

    "abstract": "Radiotherapy is essential for locoregional control in resectable soft-tissue sarcoma and remains a key strategy for unresectable soft-tissue sarcoma. Poly-ADP-ribose polymerase inhibitors, such as olaparib, may enhance radiosensitivity by targeting DNA damage repair pathways. This multicenter phase Ib trial evaluated the combination of olaparib and radiotherapy in soft-tissue sarcoma of the limbs or trunk wall. Olaparib was administered twice daily at doses of 25, 50, 100, or 150 mg during the dose-escalation phase. Radiotherapy consisted of 50 Gy (25 fractions) for resectable tumors or 59.4 Gy (33 fractions) for unresectable tumors. Radiotherapy was exclusively preoperative for operable patients. Primary objectives were to determine the maximum tolerated dose and recommended phase II dose. Dose escalation was conducted using the time-to-event continual reassessment method. Histological response was assessed in surgical cases, and RECIST 1.1 criteria were applied for non-surgical cases. Between October 2016 and April 2021, 41 patients were recruited across five French centers. The recommended phase II dose was identified as 100 mg olaparib twice daily. For operable patients, a favorable histological response was observed in 33% of patients, with a local relapse-free survival rate of 90.5% at 1 year. In contrast, among patients with inoperable tumors, the median progression-free survival was 7.7 months (95% confidence interval 2.6-28.4 months), with partial responses achieved in 20% of cases and stable disease in 60%. Grade 3 radiation dermatitis was the most frequent adverse event (34.1%), and two patients experienced grade 5 toxicity (4.8%). The combination of olaparib and radiotherapy is feasible for soft-tissue sarcoma patients but requires stringent selection, avoiding patients with tumors involving critical vascular structures or those at high surgical risk, to minimize severe complications. Further randomized trials are warranted to validate efficacy and safety compared with radiotherapy alone.",

    "abstract": "A recent publication by Bornes and colleagues explored the impact of the estrous cycle on mammary tumor response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Using genetically engineered mouse models, Bornes and colleagues revealed that chemotherapy is less effective when initiated during the diestrous stage compared with during the estrous stage. A number of changes during diestrus were identified that may reduce chemosensitivity of mammary tumors: an increased mesenchymal state of breast cancer cells during diestrus, decreased blood vessel diameters, and higher numbers of macrophages in the tumor microenvironment. Macrophage depletion was sufficient to mitigate this resistance. To translate these findings to humans, retrospective analyses of premenopausal patients with breast cancer were conducted. Serum progesterone levels served to determine the menstrual cycle phases, which revealed that treatment efficacy is reduced in women receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy during the luteal (progesterone-high) phase compared with those treated during the follicular (progesterone-low) phase. The findings show that physiologic hormone fluctuations may influence chemosensitivity through tumor cell-extrinsic mechanisms, with the important implication that aligning treatment initiation with the menstrual cycle improves therapeutic outcomes and that consideration of systemic factors may improve therapy outcomes.",

Retrospective single-center study of consecutive metastatic melanoma and renal cell carcinoma (RCC) patients undergoing first-line ICI treatment. The iodine concentration measurement time points include prior to initiation of therapy (baseline [BL]), after initiation (follow-up [FU1]), and either time point nearest to 12 months or at time of progression (final follow-up [FFU]). Target lesion DECT-based whole-volume tumor normalized iodine concentration average (NICave) and size measurements were obtained. Reference standard was individual lesion FFU status categorized as responders or nonresponders per RECIST 1.1. Logistic regression model assessed NICave change and FU1 lesion response as predictors of FFU lesion outcome. Model's performance was summarized with AUC. Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) summarized inter-rater agreement of NICave. Forty-six patients were included (mean age 61 ± 11 years, 12 women; 16 melanoma). Sixty-four of 175 target lesions were confirmed nonresponders at FFU. In a multivariable model, lesion status at FU1 (odds ratio [OR]: 27.4, p < 0.001) and changes in NICave from BL to FU1 (OR: 2.42 per 1-SD increase, p = 0.019) were significant predictors of lesion status at FFU.

    "abstract": "Outcomes for patients with advanced sarcomas are poor and there is a high unmet need to develop novel therapies. The purpose of this phase I study was to define the safety and efficacy of botensilimab (BOT), an Fc-enhanced anti-cytotoxic lymphocyte-association protein-4 antibody, plus balstilimab (BAL), an anti-PD-1 antibody, in advanced sarcomas. BOT was administered intravenously (IV) at 1 mg/kg or 2 mg/kg once every 6 weeks in combination with BAL IV at 3 mg/kg once every 2 weeks for up to 2 years. The primary end point was to determine dose-limiting toxicities during the dose-escalation period. Secondary end points include objective response rate (ORR), duration of response (DOR), disease control rate, and progression-free survival (PFS) by RECIST 1.1. Exploratory end points include assessing patient biomarkers including tumor mutational burden, cytokines, and PD-L1 expression. Overall, 64 patients with sarcoma were treated; all were evaluable for safety and 52 for efficacy. The most common treatment-related adverse event (TRAE) was diarrhea/colitis occurring in 35.9% of patients, with grade 3 in 6.3% of patients. No grade 4 or 5 TRAEs were reported. For all evaluable patients, ORR was 19.2% (95% CI, 9.6 to 32.5), and 27.8% (95% CI, 9.7 to 53.5) for evaluable patients with angiosarcoma (n = 18); 33.3% in visceral and 22.2% in cutaneous subtypes. Median PFS for evaluable patients was 4.4 months (95% CI, 2.8 to 6.1), with a 6-month PFS rate of 36% (95% CI, 22 to 50) and a median DOR of 21.7 months (95% CI, 1.9 to not reached). The combination of BOT/BAL demonstrated promising efficacy and safety in a large cohort of heavily pretreated sarcoma patients.

    "abstract": "Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is overexpressed in nasopharyngeal carcinoma and suppresses the anti-tumour immune response. Previous studies have shown that adding anti-VEGF treatment to PD-1 inhibition treatment strategies improves tumour response. We aimed to compare the efficacy of pembrolizumab, a PD-1 inhibitor, with or without bevacizumab, a VEGF inhibitor, in nasopharyngeal carcinoma. In this randomised, open-label, phase 2 trial done at two hospitals (National University Cancer Institute and Tan Tock Seng Hospital) in Singapore, patients with platinum-resistant recurrent or metastatic nasophayngeal carcinoma were eligible if they were aged 21 years or older and had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0-1. Patients were assigned (1:1; using random permuted blocks with varying sizes of 4 and 6) to receive either intravenous pembrolizumab (200 mg) every 21 days or a combination of pembrolizumab with intravenous bevacizumab (7·5 mg/kg) administered 1 week prior to each dose, until radiographic disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, completion of 32 cycles, or withdrawal of consent. The study was open label, therefore no masking of treatment assignment was implemented. The primary endpoint was objective response rate, assessed using RECIST (version 1.1) by independent radiologists and analysed in the intention-to-treat population (ie, all randomly assigned patients). This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03813394, and enrolment has closed. Between May 13, 2019, and Dec 6, 2023, we assessed 60 individuals for eligibility, 12 were excluded, and 48 were randomly allocated to pembrolizumab alone (n=24) or a combination of bevacizumab and pembrolizumab (n=24). The median age was 56 years (IQR 48-65), and 40 (83%) of 48 patients were male and eight (17%) were female. The median follow-up was 28·3 months (IQR 15·1-55·9). The objective response rate was significantly higher in the bevacizumab and pembrolizumab group (58·3% [95% CI 36·6-77·9] than in the pembrolizumab group (12·5% [2·7-32·4]; unadjusted RR 4·67 [95% CI 1·54-14·18]; p=0·0010). Grade 3 treatment-related adverse events occurred in two (8%) of 24 patients in the pembrolizumab group and in seven (29%) of 24 patients in the bevacizumab and pembrolizumab group; the most common severe or grade 3-4 treatment-related adverse events were thrombosis or bleeding (four [17%] of 24 patients in the bevacizumab and pembrolizumab group vs none of 24 patients in the pembrolizumab group), and others were transaminitis (none vs 1 [4%]), colitis (1 [4%] vs none]), cytopenias (none vs 1 [4%]), dermatological toxicities (1 [4%] vs none]), hypertension (1 [4%] vs none]), and proteinuria (1 [4%] vs none]). There were no grade 4 treatment-related adverse events or treatment-related deaths in either group. Pembrolizumab in combination with bevacizumab was more efficacious than pembrolizumab monotherapy, with manageable toxicities in platinum-resistant nasopharyngeal carcinoma.

Eligible patients were treated with stereotactic radiosurgery or whole-brain radiotherapy combined with camrelizumab (200 mg intravenously once every 3 weeks) and investigator-selected platinum-doublet chemotherapy (pemetrexed 500 mg/m Between May 6, 2020, and Jan 30, 2023, 67 patients were assessed for eligibility. Two patients were excluded (brain lesions less than 5 mm) and 65 patients were enrolled and treated. Median age was 66 years (IQR 62-70). 60 (92%) of 65 patients were male and five (8%) were female. All 65 patients were Han Chinese. 50 (77%) of 65 patients had non-squamous NSCLC and 46 (71%) were symptomatic. The 6-month progression-free survival rate was 71·7% (95% CI 58·9-81·1) during the median follow-up of 14·1 months (IQR 9·0-20·3; data cutoff Dec 13, 2023). The most common grade 3-4 treatment-related adverse events were decreased neutrophil count (14 [22%] of 65 patients), decreased white blood cell count (ten [15%]), decreased platelet count (ten [15%]), and decreased lymphocyte count (nine [14%]). Neurological toxic effects of grade 3 occurred in three (5%) of 65 patients. Radiation necrosis occurred in three (5%) of 65 patients; all were grade 1 or 2. There were no treatment-related deaths. Brain radiotherapy combined with camrelizumab and platinum-doublet chemotherapy shows promising efficacy and manageable toxicity and could be a potential treatment option for patients with brain metastases from NSCLC. Randomised controlled trials will be required to confirm these findings. Beijing Xisike Clinical Oncology Research Foundation and Jiangsu Hengrui Pharmaceuticals.

    "abstract": "In CheckMate 204, nivolumab + ipilimumab showed high intracranial (IC) objective response rates (icORRs) in patients with melanoma brain metastases (MBMs). Using icORR as a surrogate for overall survival (OS) has prompted use of alternate response criteria. To set the stage for harmonized MBM trials, the aim of this exploratory analysis was to determine icORR using several response criteria and examine correlations of response with survival. Patients (N = 119) with ≥one unirradiated MBMs received nivolumab + ipilimumab every 3 weeks (four doses), followed by nivolumab every 2 weeks for ≤24 months. Blinded review icORR was assessed with modified RECIST (mRECIST), Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology Brain Metastases (RANO-BM; 5 mm and 10 mm cutoffs), and volumetric criteria (5 mm and 10 mm). Using a 6-week response landmark, IC progression-free survival (icPFS) and OS were compared for responders versus nonresponders. icORR was higher with mRECIST and volumetric criteria than with RANO-BM or RECIST. mRECIST and volumetric response also showed stronger correlations with icPFS and OS. mRECIST responders who were RANO-BM 5 mm nonresponders (n = 14) had similar OS to RANO-BM 5 mm responders (n = 41). Clinical deterioration affected RANO-BM icORR; however, when assessed only radiographically without deterioration, RANO-BM 5 mm performed similarly to mRECIST. Among 41 patients with target lesions all <10 mm, responder icPFS and OS were similar to those of responders in the total population, indicating that response could be accurately determined in these patients. This analysis supports mRECIST or radiographic-only RANO-BM 5 mm as reliable assessment scales in MBM trials. Volumetric response correlated with survival, supporting its application in future trials. Response could be accurately determined in patients with MBMs all <10 mm, supporting the inclusion of patients with MBMs ≥5 mm in future trials.",

    "abstract": "Progressive disease (PD) in patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) varies widely in outcomes according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), version 1.1. Efforts to modify RECIST for ICI treatment have not resolved the heterogeneity in PD patterns, posing a clinical challenge. To develop and validate a modified PD classification based on PD patterns and evaluate its association with postprogression survival (PPOS) in patients treated with the programmed cell death protein ligand 1 antibody atezolizumab across various solid tumors. This study analyzed data from 5 phase 3 trials (IMmotion151, IMvigor211, OAK, Impower133, and IMspire150) involving patients treated with atezolizumab for renal cell carcinoma (RCC), urothelial carcinoma, small cell lung cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, and melanoma. This post hoc analysis was conducted from March to September 2024. Treatment with atezolizumab. The primary outcome was the association of PD patterns with PPOS. Seven PD patterns were identified based on the enlargement of target and nontarget lesions or new lesions and their combinations. A total of 1377 patients were analyzed across the 5 trials. In RCC, 7 PD patterns significantly affected prognosis. The 6-month PPOS probability ranged from 26% for progression in target and nontarget lesions plus new lesions to 90% for progression in either target or nontarget lesions alone. A modified PD classification was developed that categorized PD into 3 risk levels: low risk (progression of existing lesions), intermediate risk (new lesions without progression of existing lesions), and high risk (progression of existing lesions plus new lesions). This score was associated with PPOS in ICI-treated RCC, with hazard ratios of 0.23 (95% CI, 0.13-0.41; P < .001) and 0.39 (95% CI, 0.23-0.66; P < .001) for low-risk and intermediate-risk PD compared with high-risk PD, respectively. Validation in additional trials confirmed the score's applicability across various tumors. In this study, a survival score was developed based on PD patterns. The risk classification was associated with PPOS across various solid tumors treated with immunotherapy and may therefore enhance prognostication and clinical decision-making, potentially providing a valuable tool for treating patients with PD who are receiving immunotherapy.",

    "abstract": "This study evaluates the prognostic value of tumor response on CT at 3 months, assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), modified RECIST (mRECIST), and Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System Treatment Response Algorithm (LR-TRA) in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treated with selective internal radiation therapy (SIRT). A retrospective analysis was conducted on 102 HCC patients treated with SIRT between 2018 and 2020. RECIST, mRECIST, and LR-TRA were assessed at 3 months post-SIRT. Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were assessed using Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox proportional-hazards models. The median age was 71 years, and most patients (90%) had advanced-stage tumors (Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer-C). After a median follow-up of 32.0 months (95% CI: 16.8-60.9), 60/102 patients died (59%), and 90/102 patients showed tumor progression (88%). Median OS was 20.4 months (95% CI: 15.4-33.0), and median PFS was 14.5 months (95% CI: 6.5-24.5); 1-year OS and PFS rates were 65.6% and 50.7%. Multivariable analysis revealed that early response according to RECIST 1.1 (HR 1.66, p = 0.30), mRECIST (HR 1.40, p = 0.215), and LR-TRA (HR 0.67, p = 0.30) were not predictors of OS. Disease progression evaluated by RECIST (HR 2.55, p < 0.001) and mRECIST (HR 2.53, p < 0.001), bilirubin levels (HR 1.03, p < 0.001), and prothrombin time (HR 0.98, p = 0.005) were predictors of OS. For PFS, neither RECIST nor mRECIST response, disease progression, nor LR-TRA viability were predictors. In this advanced-stage HCC population, early response assessed by RECIST, mRECIST, and LR-TRA criteria did not predict OS or PFS after SIRT. However, early disease progression and liver function indicators were prognostic factors for OS. QuestionHow well does early tumor response, assessed at 3 months post-selective internal radiation therapy (SIRT), predict survival in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients? Findings Early response, assessed by RECIST, mRECIST, and LR-TRA, did not predict overall or progression-free survival; disease progression and liver function indicators were significant predictors. Clinical relevance This study highlights the limitations of early imaging criteria in predicting survival outcomes in advanced HCC post-SIRT, suggesting the need for alternative or complementary prognostic indicators to guide treatment decisions.",

    "abstract": "Despite increasing interest, prospective data on the use of degradable starch microsphere-transarterial chemoembolization (DSM-TACE) in the management of patients with unresectable HCC are still scarce. The objective of the HepaStar study was to collect prospective safety and effectiveness data in a prospective multicenter observational study. Between January 2017 and December 2022, consecutive participants with unresectable or recurrent HCC treated with DSM-TACE as standard of care at 6 participating centers in Europe were enrolled. Tumor response was evaluated according to the mRECIST criteria. Overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and adverse events (AEs) were assessed by using Kaplan-Meier analysis and Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 5. Liver function deterioration was assessed by monitoring changes in liver blood tests during the follow-up. Seventy-nine participants (median age, 69 years (IQR, 51-87 years); 67 men (85%)) were enrolled and treated. The median follow-up time was 18 months (IQR 9.5-38.0 months). The estimated median OS and PFS for the entire cohort was 32 months (CI, 95% 21-NaN) and 9 months (CI, 95% 7-NaN), respectively. Eleven (13.9%) participants experienced at least one grade 3 or 4 AE. The most frequent grade 3-4 AE was elevated bilirubin (2.2%, 5 of 79). Deterioration of bilirubin, AST, ALT, and albumin were observed in 24.1%, 23.7%, 19%, and 24% of participants, respectively. DSM-TACE achieves promising survival in patients with unresectable or recurrent HCC. This technique shows a favorable safety profile both in terms of treatment-related AEs and liver function deterioration. Question Although degradable starch microspheres transarterial chemoembolization is widely used in clinical practice across Europe, prospective data on its application in hepatocellular carcinoma patients remains limited. Findings Degradable starch microspheres transarterial chemoembolization results in promising survival rates, good tumor response rates, and low rates of treatment-related adverse events. Clinical relevance In patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma, degradable starch microspheres transarterial chemoembolization represents a safe and effective alternative to more well-established chemoembolization techniques like conventional transarterial chemoembolization and drug-eluting beads transarterial chemoembolization.",

This is a retrospective study with a cohort of 216 patients with advanced sarcoma treated with ICI between 2016 and 2023 at Stanford Health Care. Overall survival, progression-free survival (PFS), objective response rates (ORR) per RECIST criteria, and reason for ICI discontinuation were analyzed across histologic subtypes, ICI regimens, tumor mutational burden, and PD-L1 expression. The overall ORR in the cohort was 16.7%. The histologic subtypes with the highest ORR were Kaposi sarcoma (KS, 66.7%), alveolar soft part sarcoma (ASPS, 50%), angiosarcoma (33.3%), myxofibrosarcoma (MFS, 28.6%), and undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (UPS, 27.8%). The subtypes with the lowest ORR were osteosarcoma (0%), synovial sarcoma (0%), and liposarcoma (3.7%). The subtypes with the highest median PFS were KS (median not reached), ASPS (median not reached), MFS (27.4 months), and UPS (11.3 months). The ORR for sarcomas with PD-L1 ≥ 1% was 27.8% (P = 0.02), whereas the ORR for sarcomas with tumor mutational burden ≥10 mutations per megabase of DNA was 28.6% (P = 0.20). ORR and PFS were highly variable across sarcoma histologic subtypes. In this large analysis, KS, ASPS, angiosarcoma, MFS, and UPS demonstrated the highest ORR and longest PFS while osteosarcoma, synovial sarcoma, and liposarcoma had the lowest ORR and shortest PFS. PD-L1 expression was also associated with increased ORR. Our findings provide further insight into understanding the sarcoma histologic and immunologic factors that correspond with response to ICI.",

This retrospective study included consecutive patients with colorectal liver metastases between January 1, 2012, and December 3, 2021, who were undergoing chemotherapy and who had at least one follow-up gadoxetic-enhanced MRI. For each patient, two MRIs (baseline MRI and follow-up MRI) were randomly selected. Follow-up MRIs were separated into two sets of images: complete MRIs, including all imaging sequences, and abbreviated MRIs, including coronal and axial hepatobiliary phase imaging, axial diffusion-weighted imaging, and coronal T2-weighted imaging. Seven radiologists reviewed the two sets of images, with a month's break in between, assessing Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 category and the presence of new lesions, with each reader assigned 80-91 patients. Inter-reader agreement was assessed using Fleiss' kappa (κ). One-hundred ninety-five patients (mean age 54.4 +/- 12.1 years, 135 men) were evaluated. Intra-reader agreement between abbreviated and complete MRI was substantial for the RECIST 1.1 category (κ, 0.66-0.89) and the detection of new lesions (κ, 0.63-0.81).

Previous results from KEYNOTE-177 showed a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) with pembrolizumab versus chemotherapy ± bevacizumab/cetuximab in MSI-H/dMMR mCRC. Results after >5 years of follow-up are reported. Adults with untreated MSI-H/dMMR mCRC were randomly assigned 1 : 1 to receive pembrolizumab 200 mg intravenously every 3 weeks or chemotherapy. Patients assigned to chemotherapy could cross over to pembrolizumab after centrally confirmed progressive disease. Dual primary endpoints were PFS per RECIST v1.1 and overall survival (OS). Secondary endpoints included duration of response and safety. At data cut-off (17 July 2023), median follow-up was 73.3 months (range, 64.9-89.2 months). Overall, 307 patients were assigned to receive pembrolizumab (n = 153) or chemotherapy (n = 154). Fifty-seven (37.0%) patients assigned to chemotherapy crossed over to pembrolizumab per protocol; 39 (25.3%) received a programmed cell death protein 1/programmed death-ligand 1 [PD-(L)1] inhibitor off protocol (effective crossover rate, 62%). Median OS was 77.5 months with pembrolizumab versus 36.7 months with chemotherapy (hazard ratio, 0.73; 95% confidence interval 0.53-0.99); 5-year OS rates were 54.8% versus 44.2%. Median PFS was 16.5 months with pembrolizumab and 8.2 months with chemotherapy (hazard ratio, 0.60; 95% confidence interval 0.45-0.79).

This retrospective study enrolled LARC patients who underwent preoperative rectal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Based on histologic assessment, the patients were divided into a pathological complete response (pCR) group or a non-pCR group. APTw histogram features, apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), and clinical parameters were analyzed. Mann-Whitney U-test, Spearman rank correlation, and univariate and multivariate logistic regression were used for statistical analysis. The predictive performances of different models were evaluated by the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC). One-hundred forty-five patients were included (mean age, 61.6 years ± 11.8 [SD]; 87 men). pCR patients exhibited lower pre-treatment ADC value, higher pre-treatment APTw-10%, APTw-90%, minimum, maximum, median, mean, range, and root mean square (RMS) of the primary tumor compared to non-pCR patients (all p < 0.05). APTw-10%, APTw-90%, maximum, mean, median, minimum, range, and RMS showed negative correlations with the tumor regression grade (TRG) category (r ranged between -0.457 and -0.173; all p < 0.005). Skewness, kurtosis, and entropy exhibited positive correlations with the TRG category (r = 0.278, 0.319, and 0.324, respectively; all p < 0.05). The combined model had a higher AUC of 0.930, with 93.9% sensitivity and 83.9% specificity. Histogram analysis of pre-treatment APTw may hold promise as a novel approach for predicting the response of LARC patients to nCRT. Question Predicting response to nCRT is crucial for early stratified management of LARC patients; however, current radiological studies remain inconclusive. Finding LARC patients with pCR is correlated with higher pre-treatment APTw intensity-related and lower shape-related histogram features. Clinical relevance The APTw-histogram model and the APTw-clinical combined model demonstrated strong diagnostic efficacy and clinical practicality in predicting LARC patients' responsiveness to nCRT, offering new insights for early clinical decision-making.",

Identifying prognostic factors for the failure of AS will help determine the strategy. The aim of this study was to investigate the prognostic impact of clinical and molecular variables in a larger series. Data available as of January 31, 2024, from the three studies, in which patients were followed for ≥3 years, were pooled. Patients ≥18 years of age, with primary sporadic desmoid-type fibromatosis, and with CTNNB1 mutations available were eligible. The primary study endpoint was treatment-free survival (TFS). Secondary endpoints included the incidence of RECIST progression, spontaneous RECIST regression, and regression post-RECIST progression. Patients (n = 282) with a median follow-up of 53 months (IQR, 39-63) were included. The 3- and 5-year TFS rates were 67% and 66%, respectively; the 3- and 5-year crude cumulative incidences were 33% and 34% for RECIST progression, 26% and 34% for RECIST regression, and 33% and 38% for regression post-RECIST progression, respectively. In multivariable analysis, larger tumor size, mutation type, and tumor locations were associated with lower TFS. The specific mutation (S45F), larger tumor size, and extremity and trunk locations were all associated with a lower probability of spontaneous RECIST regression. This study confirms that spontaneous regression occurs in a significant proportion of patients and that two-thirds are treatment free at 5 years. Initial tumor size, CTNNB1 mutation, and location should be factored into the initial decision-making process.",

    "abstract": "To investigate the predictive value of RECIST response within 3, 6, or 12 months on long-term survival, and explore differences between nivolumab+ipilimumab and nivolumab monotherapy, we analyzed pooled 5-year data of 935 responder and non-responder patients at various time points after treatment initiation in CheckMate 069, 066, and 067 studies. Treatment-naive advanced melanoma patients received nivolumab+ipilimumab or nivolumab monotherapy. To decrease immortal time bias, 3-, 6-, or 12-month overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) landmark analyses were performed. Association between characteristics and response was evaluated by univariate and multivariate analyses. Response rates at any time were 58 % (239/409) for nivolumab+ipilimumab and 44 % (230/526) for nivolumab monotherapy. In 12-month landmark analyses, 5-year OS rates for responders versus non-responders were 82 % versus 40 % with nivolumab+ipilimumab (HR=0.23 [95 % CI, 0.15-0.35]) and 76 % versus 32 % with nivolumab monotherapy (HR=0.22 [95 % CI, 0.16-0.31]). PFS rates were 83 % versus 32 % and 69 % versus 46 %, respectively. Similar strong associations between response at 3 and 6 months and 5-year OS and PFS were also observed with more than 70 % of the responses observed in the first 3 months. Response rates correlated with baseline LDH and PD-L1 status by multivariate analysis but the association between response and long-term survival was maintained in landmark analyses even among patients with high LDH and low PD-L1 expression. Clinical response evaluated in the first months of therapy is a strong predictor of long-term survival, even in patients with poor prognostic biomarkers.",

    "abstract": "Inhibition of the cyclin D-cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)4/6-INK4-retinoblastoma pathway can overcome acquired or de novo treatment resistance to endocrine monotherapy. Responses to endocrine monotherapy in advanced endometrial cancer are suboptimal, perhaps due to genomic alterations that promote estrogen receptor-independent cyclin D1-CDK4/6 activation. We hypothesized that the addition of abemaciclib, a CDK4/6 kinase inhibitor, to antiestrogen therapy with fulvestrant would be an effective therapeutic strategy in patients with advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer. In this phase II study, patients with advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer received 150 mg of abemaciclib orally twice daily with 500 mg of fulvestrant intramuscularly monthly with a 2-week loading dose. Eligibility included estrogen receptor or progesterone receptor expression ≥1% by IHC, measurable disease, ≤2 prior lines of chemotherapy, and ≤1 prior lines of hormonal therapy. The primary endpoint was the objective response rate by RECIST v1.1. Twenty-seven patients initiated therapy, and 25 were evaluable for efficacy. Eleven patients achieved partial response; 10 responses (91%) were in copy number-low/no specific molecular profile tumors, 1 response (9%) was in a microsatellite instability-high tumor, and no responses were observed in copy number-high/TP53abnormal tumors. The objective response rate was 44% (90% confidence interval, 27.0%-62.1%). The median duration of response was 15.6 months. The median progression-free survival was 9.0 months (90% confidence interval, 1.8-20.4). The most common grade ≥3 treatment-related adverse events were neutropenia (26%) and anemia (19%); no new safety signals were identified. The combination of abemaciclib and fulvestrant has promising activity with durable responses in advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer; a randomized trial is planned.

Manual segmentation is accurate but not feasible in clinical workflow, while automatic segmentation generally performs sub-par. To develop a minimally interactive deep learning-based segmentation method for soft-tissue tumors (STTs) on CT and MRI. The interactive method requires the user to click six points near the tumor's extreme boundaries in the image. These six points are transformed into a distance map and serve, with the image, as input for a convolutional neural network. A multi-center public dataset with 514 patients and nine STT phenotypes in seven anatomical locations, with CT or T1-weighted MRI, was used for training and internal validation. For external validation, another public dataset was employed, which included five unseen STT phenotypes in extremities on CT, T1-weighted MRI, and T2-weighted fat-saturated (FS) MRI. Internal validation resulted in a dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 0.85 ± 0.11 (mean ± standard deviation) for CT and 0.84 ± 0.12 for T1-weighted MRI. External validation resulted in DSCs of 0.81 ± 0.08 for CT, 0.84 ± 0.09 for T1-weighted MRI, and 0.88 ± 0.08 for T2-weighted FS MRI. Volumetric measurements showed consistent replication with low error internally (volume: 1 ± 28 mm The minimally interactive segmentation method effectively segments STT phenotypes on CT and MRI, with robust generalization to unseen phenotypes and imaging modalities. Question Can this deep learning-based method segment soft-tissue tumors faster than can be done manually and more accurately than other automatic methods? Findings The minimally interactive segmentation method achieved accurate segmentation results in internal and external validation, and generalized well across soft-tissue tumor phenotypes and imaging modalities. Clinical relevance This minimally interactive deep learning-based segmentation method could reduce the burden of manual segmentation, facilitate the integration of imaging-based biomarkers (e.g., radiomics) into clinical practice, and provide a fast, semi-automatic solution for volume and diameter measurements (e.g., RECIST).",

The CT/MRI Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System (LI-RADS) Treatment Response Assessment (TRA) algorithm provides guidance for step-by-step tumor assessment after LRT and standardized reporting. Current evidence suggests that the algorithm performs well in the assessment of tumor response to arterial embolic and loco-ablative therapies and fair when assessing response to radiation-based therapies, with limited data to validate the latter. Both evidence-based and expert-based refinements of the algorithm are needed to improve its diagnostic accuracy after varying types of LRT.

Promising antitumor activity was previously reported in the non-liver metastatic (NLM) population. This updated analysis describes long-term survival outcomes in the NLM cohort and highlights durable remissions with potential cure following completion of RIN therapy. Between May 2020 and January 2022, 39 patients with refractory MSS metastatic colorectal cancer were enrolled. Patients received RIN until progression, unacceptable toxicity, or completion at two years. The primary endpoint was recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) selection. Secondary endpoints were safety, overall response rate (ORR), progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) at the RP2D level. 22 patients with refractory non-liver metastatic MSS colorectal cancer were treated at the RP2D of RIN. ORR was 36.4 % (8/22 patients), and median PFS was 5.0 months (95 % CI: 3-9). After a median follow-up of 42 months, the 1-, 2-, and 3-year PFS rates were 24.1 %, 24.1 %, and 19.3 % by RECIST.

As nectin-4 is widely expressed in HNC, enfortumab vedotin (EV), a nectin-4-directed antibody-drug conjugate, was explored in HNC in EV-202 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04225117). This open-label, multicohort, phase II study evaluated intravenous EV 1.25 mg/kg on days 1, 8, and 15 of each 28-day cycle. In the HNC cohort, eligible patients had recurrent/metastatic HNC and had received platinum-based therapy for locally advanced/metastatic disease and a PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor. The primary end point was investigator-assessed confirmed objective response rate (ORR) per RECIST version 1.1. Secondary end points were investigator-assessed duration of response (DOR), disease control rate (DCR), and progression-free survival (PFS); overall survival (OS); and safety. The primary analysis included 46 patients; all received EV (median follow-up, 9.3 months). Most patients (52.2%) had ≥3 previous lines of systemic therapy in the metastatic setting. Confirmed ORR was 23.9%, DCR was 56.5%, and median DOR was not reached (median DOR was 9.4 months at a later data cutoff [median follow-up, 11.3 months]). Median PFS and OS were 3.9 and 6.0 months, respectively. Treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) occurring in >20% of patients were alopecia (28.3%), fatigue (26.1%), and peripheral sensory neuropathy (23.9%). Sixteen patients (34.8%) experienced grade ≥3 TRAEs; anemia and decreased neutrophil count occurred in ≥1 patient (both n = 2; 4.3%). EV demonstrated antitumor activity in heavily pretreated HNC. Safety was consistent with the known safety profile of EV; no new safety signals were identified. These data support further evaluation of EV for advanced HNC not amenable to definitive local therapy.",

This phase I study evaluated the safety of targeting ROR1 with autologous T lymphocytes engineered to express a ROR1 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR). Secondary objectives evaluated the persistence, trafficking, and antitumor activity of CAR-T cells. Twenty-one patients with ROR1+ tumors received CAR-T cells at one of four dose levels: 3.3 × 105, 1 × 106, 3.3 × 106, and 1 × 107 cells/kg body weight, administered after lymphodepletion with cyclophosphamide/fludarabine or oxaliplatin/cyclophosphamide.

A second infusion was administered to one patient in cohort A with residual CLL in the marrow and three patients in cohort B with stable disease after first infusion. Treatment was well tolerated, apart from one dose-limiting toxicity at dose level 4 in a patient with advanced NSCLC. Two of the three (67%) patients with CLL showed robust CAR-T-cell expansion and a rapid antitumor response. In patients with NSCLC and TNBC, CAR-T cells expanded to variable levels and infiltrated tumors poorly and 1 of 18 patients (5.5%) achieved partial response by RECIST 1.1. ROR1 CAR-T cells were well tolerated in most patients. Antitumor activity was observed in CLL but was limited in TNBC and NSCLC. Immunogenicity of the CAR and lack of sustained tumor infiltration were identified as limitations. See related commentary by Kobold, p. 437.",

To evaluate the efficacy of anti-programmed cell death 1 nivolumab and anti-cytotoxic lymphocyte-associated protein 4 ipilimumab in patients with aggressive thyroid carcinoma. This phase 2 nonrandomized clinical trial enrolled patients with RAIR DTC in a single center from October 2017 to May 2019, with exploratory cohorts in MTC and ATC. The data were analyzed between June 2021 and September 2023. Intravenous nivolumab, 3 mg/kg, every 2 weeks and ipilimumab, 1 mg/kg, every 6 weeks until disease progression, intolerable adverse events, or a maximum duration of 2 years. The primary end point of the study was objective response rate (ORR) in RAIR DTC, which was scored according to RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours), version 1.1. Key secondary end points included safety, progression-free survival, overall survival, and biomarker analyses. A total of 51 patients were registered, and 49 patients were evaluable for analysis. The median (range) age was 65 years (30-88 years), and 25 participants (51%) were female. ORR in the DTC cohort was 9.4% (3/32 [95% CI, 2.8%-28.5%]), with all partial responses in either oncocytic carcinoma (2/6 [33.0%]) or poorly differentiated thyroid carcinoma (1/5 [20.0%]). Clinical benefit rates were 62.5% (20/32) in the overall DTC cohort, including 83.3% (5/6) in oncocytic carcinoma and 40% (2/5) in poorly differentiated thyroid carcinoma. ORR in the exploratory ATC cohort was 30.0% (3/10 [95% CI, 6.7%-65.2%]), with a clinical benefit rates of 50.0% (5/10). No responses were observed in the exploratory MTC cohort. The safety profile was similar to prior reports with dual immune checkpoint inhibition (pruritus, rash, diarrhea, fatigue, and elevation of lipase and liver enzymes). The presence of NRAS tumor genetic sequence variations, but not BRAF V600E, was associated with worse outcomes. This phase 2 nonrandomized clinical trial reported clinical activity of dual immune checkpoint inhibition in aggressive thyroid cancer.

    "abstract": "Neoadjuvant use of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) before liver resection results in pathological tumour regression in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. We aimed to describe the characteristics of pathological responses after preoperative ICI therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma and to evaluate the association between the depth of tumour regression and relapse-free survival. In this cross-trial, patient-level analysis, we performed a pooled analysis of data from patients with hepatocellular carcinoma receiving ICI therapy before liver resection as part of a global collaborative consortium (NeoHCC) of five phase 1 and 2 clinical trials and standardised observational protocols conducted in 12 tertiary referral centres across the USA, UK, and Taiwan. Eligible patients were adults (aged ≥18 years) diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma by tissue core biopsy before treatment initiation, a Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System score of 5 on imaging, or both, with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status score of 0-1, and no extrahepatic spread or previous ICI treatment. Pathological response was measured as the percentage of non-viable tumour in the resected surgical specimen, with major pathological response corresponding to at least 70% tumour regression and pathological complete response corresponding to 100% tumour regression. We correlated pathological response with radiological overall response using RECIST criteria (version 1.1) and relapse-free survival, and evaluated the threshold of tumour regression that could be optimally associated with relapse-free survival. At data cutoff on Jan 31, 2024, 111 patients were included in the study, of whom data on pathological response were available for 104 (94%) patients. Patients received treatment from Oct 5, 2017, to Nov 15, 2023, mostly ICI combinations (76 [69%]), for a median of 1·4 months (IQR 0·7-2·9). 87 (78%) patients were men and 24 (22%) were women. Most patients had underlying viral chronic liver disease (73 [66%]) and Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage A hepatocellular carcinoma (61 [55%]), without portal vein thrombosis (87 [78%]). We observed major pathological response in 33 (32%) patients and pathological complete response in 19 (18%) patients. Radiological overall response was associated with major pathological response, with 23 (74%) of 31 patients with radiological response showing major pathological response compared with ten (14%) of 73 patients without radiological response (p<0·0001). However, ten (30%) of 33 major pathological responses were not predicted by radiological response. After a median follow-up of 27·2 months (95% CI 22·3-32·1), median relapse-free survival for the whole cohort was 43·6 months (95% CI 28·3-not evaluable). Relapse-free survival was significantly longer in patients with major pathological response than in those who did not have a major pathological response (not reached [95% CI not evaluable-not evaluable] vs 28·3 months [12·8-43·8]; hazard ratio 0·26 [0·10-0·66]; p=0·0024) and in patients with pathological complete response than in those who did not have a pathological complete response (NR [95% CI not evaluable-not evaluable] vs 32·8 months [15·0-50·5]; 0·19 [0·05-0·78]; p=0·010). Unbiased recursive partitioning of the cohort for the risk of relapse, death, or both identified a threshold of 90% as the optimal cutoff of pathological tumour regression to predict improved relapse-free survival. The extent of tumour regression following neoadjuvant ICI therapy could identify patients with improved relapse-free survival following liver resection. The threshold of at least 90% tumour regression should be validated for its surrogate role for relapse-free survival in phase 3 randomised controlled trials. None.",

The data analyses were performed between March 22, 2020 (first patient in) and June 22, 2022 (data cutoff for the primary analysis), and September 29, 2023 (end of study final database lock). The OLIE trial assessed the efficacy and safety of lenvatinib (14 mg/m2 taken orally once daily) combined with up to 5 cycles of ifosfamide (3000 mg/m2 intravenously) and etoposide (100 mg/m2 intravenously) on days 1 to 3 of each cycle vs IE alone at the same doses. Patients randomized to IE could cross over to receive lenvatinib upon disease progression by independent imaging review. The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS) per RECIST 1.1 by independent imaging review. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate the PFS distribution, with a prespecified 1-sided significance threshold of .025 by stratified log-rank test. Secondary end points included PFS rate at 4 months and overall survival. Adverse events were summarized using descriptive statistics. A total of 81 patients were enrolled (median [IQR] age, 15.0 [12.0-18.0] years; 46 males [56.8%]), with 40 in the LEN-IE arm and 41 in the IE arm. Median PFS was 6.5 months (95% CI, 5.7-8.2 months) for the LEN-IE arm and 5.5 months (95% CI, 2.9-6.5 months) for the IE arm (hazard ratio [HR], 0.54; 95% CI, 0.27-1.08; 1-sided P = .04). The rate of PFS at 4 months was 76.3% (95% CI, 59.3%-86.9%) in the LEN-IE arm and 66.0% (95% CI, 47.7%-79.2%) in the IE arm. Median overall survival was 11.9 months (95% CI, 10.1 months to not estimable) with LEN-IE and 17.4 months (95% CI, 14.2 months to not estimable) with IE (HR, 1.28; 95% CI, 0.60-2.70; 1-sided nominal P = .75). Grade 3 or higher treatment-related adverse events occurred in 35 of 39 patients (89.7%) in the LEN-IE arm and 31 of 39 patients (79.5%) in the IE arm. Although LEN-IE did not meet prespecified statistical significance for improved PFS vs IE, this study demonstrates the importance of international collaboration and randomized clinical trials in patients with relapsed or refractory osteosarcoma and may inform future trial design.

    "title": "Histology-Specific Clinical Trial of Lenvatinib and Pembrolizumab in Patients with Sarcoma.",
    "abstract": "Survival of patients with metastatic sarcoma remains poor, and there is a pressing need for new therapies. Most sarcoma subtypes are not responsive to immune checkpoint inhibition alone. Lenvatinib, a multireceptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor targeting tumor vasculature, has an immunomodulatory activity that contributes to its antitumor effects. Therefore, we hypothesized that a combination of lenvatinib and pembrolizumab would lead to improved clinical outcomes in patients with sarcoma. This was an open-label, single-arm study of lenvatinib and pembrolizumab in the following cohorts: (A) leiomyosarcoma, (B) undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (UPS), (C) vascular sarcomas (angiosarcoma and epithelioid hemangioendothelioma), (D) synovial sarcoma or malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST), and (E) bone sarcomas (osteosarcoma and chondrosarcoma). The primary endpoint was the best overall response (BOR) rate documented by RECIST v1.1 by 27 weeks in each cohort, with a threshold of ≥2 responses among 10 patients. Secondary endpoints included progression-free survival, overall survival, duration of response, and safety. Forty-six patients were evaluable for the primary endpoint, which was met in the UPS and MPNST/synovial cohorts (BOR rates by 27 weeks of 25% and 30%, respectively). There were seven partial responses overall with additional responses noted in angiosarcoma and osteosarcoma. Treatment-related adverse events of any grade and grade 3 or higher occurred in 50/51 (98%) and 29/51 (57%) of patients, respectively. We observed durable responses in MPNST, synovial sarcoma, and osteosarcoma. Patients with UPS and angiosarcoma also responded. Further exploration of this approach is warranted to confirm activity and determine optimal dosing schedules.",

This exploratory analysis examined outcomes in patient subgroups defined by bevacizumab use. Eligible adult patients had persistent, recurrent, or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma, adenosquamous carcinoma, or adenocarcinoma of the cervix not previously treated with chemotherapy and not amenable to curative treatment; measurable disease per RECIST v1.1; and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status ≤1. Patients were randomly allocated 1 : 1 to pembrolizumab 200 mg every 3 weeks or placebo for up to 35 cycles plus chemotherapy (±bevacizumab 15 mg/kg). Dual primary endpoints were OS and PFS per RECIST v1.1 by investigator assessment. Outcomes were assessed in subgroups defined by bevacizumab use. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were based on a stratified Cox regression model. A total of 617 patients were randomly assigned [pembrolizumab arm, n = 308 (63.6% with bevacizumab); placebo arm, n = 309 (62.5% with bevacizumab)]. The most common reason for bevacizumab exclusion was medical contraindication (75.9%). Among patients who received bevacizumab, HRs (95% CIs) for PFS favored the pembrolizumab arm in the programmed cell death-ligand 1 combined positive score ≥1 [0.56 (0.43-0.73)] and all-comer [0.57 (0.45-0.73)] populations; OS results were 0.60 (0.45-0.79) and 0.61 (0.47-0.80), respectively. Among patients who did not receive bevacizumab, HRs (95% CIs) for PFS also favored the pembrolizumab arm in the programmed cell death-ligand 1 combined positive score ≥1 [0.61 (0.44-0.85)] and all-comer [0.69 (0.50-0.94)] populations; OS results were 0.61 (0.44-0.85) and 0.67 (0.49-0.91), respectively. Among patients who received bevacizumab, grade ≥3 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 74.0% of patients in the pembrolizumab arm and 66.8% in the placebo arm.

    "abstract": "Checkpoint inhibitor-induced steroid-refractory (sr) and steroid-dependent (sd) immune-related adverse events (irAE) account for about 11 % of irAE. Although these patients face worse outcomes due to irAE mortality and/or sustained immunosuppression, which impairs anti-tumor response, there is no established second-line treatment based on prospective trial data. This prospective comparative study investigates outcomes of extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP), an immunomodulating therapy, versus second-line immunosuppressants (SLI) in sr/sd-irAE. The primary endpoint was longitudinal change in immunophenotype; secondary endpoints were outcome of irAE and tumor response. Patient demographics, quality of life (EORTC QLQ-C30; global health status (GHS/QoL)) and longitudinal blood samples were analyzed at baseline; in weeks 1, 4, 8, and 12. At interim analysis, 21 patients (11 ECP, 10 SLI) with 7 different sr/sd-irAE were included. Compared with the SLI group, the ECP group demonstrated a higher clinical response rate of irAE (93 % vs. 80 %; 95 % CI 0.83-1.92; P = 0.54) and a better GHS/QoL score throughout all follow-up visits. ECP patients showed a numerically higher overall survival (23 vs. 12 months; 95 % CI 0.02-3.02; P = 0.27) and lower cancer progression rates (33 % vs. 67 %; 95 % CI 0.09-1.60; P = 0.52). Immunophenotyping revealed changes in immune cell populations and the regulation of immune checkpoints. There were no significant safety issues in either treatment group. This prospective comparative study supports the clinical efficacy of ECP in the treatment of sr/sd-irAE in comparison to the SLI cohort. Thus, ECP represents a potential treatment option for this indication, given its good safety profile while maintaining anti-tumor response.

Treatment response evaluation according to the RECIST 1.1 and iRECIST guidelines was performed for all patients. Response patterns, as well as overall response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), and time to progression (TTP), were compared between RECIST 1.1 and iRECIST. Out of 143 patients with progressive disease (PD) according to RECIST 1.1, 48 (33.6%) did not attain confirmation of progression (iCPD) as per iRECIST and six patients who were treated beyond RECIST 1.1 progression reached PD at a later point in time in iRECIST, resulting in a significant difference in TTP between iRECIST and RECIST 1.1 (618.3 ± 626.9 days vs. 538.1 ± 617.9 days, respectively (p < 0.05)). The number of non-responders as per RECIST 1.1 was 79, whereas it was 60 when using iRECIST.

AMG 193, a CNS-penetrant methylthioadenosine-cooperative protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) inhibitor, selectively induces synthetic lethality in MTAP-deleted tumor cells. Here, we report results of the completed monotherapy dose exploration evaluating AMG 193 in patients with MTAP-deleted solid tumors. In this first-in-human, multicenter, open-label, phase I study, patients with advanced CDKN2A-deleted and/or MTAP-deleted solid tumors received AMG 193 orally [once (o.d.) or twice (b.i.d.) daily] continuously in 28-day cycles. Primary objectives were safety and tolerability assessed by dose-limiting toxicities and determination of the maximum tolerated dose; secondary objectives included pharmacokinetics and preliminary antitumor activity measured by RECIST v1.1. As of 23 May 2024, 80 patients in dose exploration received AMG 193 at doses 40-1600 mg o.d. or 600 mg b.i.d. The most common treatment-related adverse events were nausea (48.8%), fatigue (31.3%), and vomiting (30.0%). Dose-limiting toxicities were reported in eight patients at doses ≥240 mg, including nausea, vomiting, fatigue, hypersensitivity reaction, and hypokalemia. The maximum tolerated dose was determined to be 1200 mg o.d. Mean exposure of AMG 193 increased in a dose-proportional manner from 40 mg to 1200 mg. Among the efficacy-assessable patients treated at the active and tolerable doses of 800 mg o.d., 1200 mg o.d., or 600 mg b.i.d. (n = 42), objective response rate was 21.4% (95% confidence interval 10.3% to 36.8%). Responses were observed across eight different tumor types, including squamous/non-squamous non-small-cell lung cancer, pancreatic adenocarcinoma, and biliary tract cancer. At doses ≥480 mg, complete intratumoral PRMT5 inhibition was confirmed in paired MTAP-deleted tumor biopsies, and molecular responses (circulating tumor DNA clearance) were observed. AMG 193 demonstrated a favorable safety profile without clinically significant myelosuppression.

However, a subset of mCRPC patients displays a more immunogenic profile. This study examines efficacy and safety of dual ICI therapy in molecularly selected mCRPC. This single-arm, phase II trial included 69 molecularly selected mCRPC patients with mismatch repair deficiency (dMMR), non-synonymous tumour mutational burden ≥7.1 muts/Mb (hTMB), a BRCA2 mutation (BRCAm), or biallelic CDK12 inactivation (CDK12i). Efficacy was assessed in ICI-naïve patients (cohort A) with RECIST 1.1 (A1) and Prostate Cancer Working Group 3 (A2) measurable disease. Safety was evaluated in cohorts A and B (prior ICI monotherapy). Treatment included nivolumab 3 mg/kg and ipilimumab 1 mg/kg every 3 weeks for four cycles, followed by nivolumab 480 mg every 4 weeks for up to 1 year. The primary endpoint was disease control rate beyond 6 months (DCR > 6), aiming to surpass a DCR > 6 of 22%. Patients initiated treatment between January 2021 and February 2024. Cohort A included 65 patients. Of these, 21 had dMMR (32%), 8 had hTMB (12%), 20 had BRCAm (31%), and 16 had CDK12i (25%). DCR > 6 was achieved in 38% of patients [95% confidence interval (CI) 27% to 51%], and was highest in dMMR (81%), followed by hTMB (25%), CDK12i (19%), and BRCAm (15%). Objective response rate in cohort A was 38% (95% CI 22% to 55%) and 47% (95% CI 34% to 60%) exhibited a 50% decline in prostate-specific antigen levels. Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 4.0 months (95% CI 3.5-12.0 months) in cohort A, and 32.7 months (95% CI 21.8 months-not reached) in dMMR patients. Treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) led to permanent discontinuation in 14 of 69 patients (20%). Grade ≥3 TRAEs occurred in 48% of patients, with diarrhoea and elevated transaminases each in 10%. There was one treatment-related death due to a bowel perforation and a second following euthanasia after grade 4 toxicity. This trial of dual ICIs in molecularly selected mCRPC met its primary endpoint, showing DCR > 6 in 38% of patients. Dual ICIs exhibited modest responses in the hTMB, BRCAm, and CDK12i subgroups, but demonstrated exceptional efficacy in dMMR.",

    "abstract": "The first-in-class hypoxia-inducible factor-2α inhibitor, belzutifan, showed clinically meaningful antitumour activity in von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease-associated neoplasms in the ongoing, single-arm, phase 2 LITESPARK-004 study. We aimed to investigate antitumour activity with an additional 16 months of follow-up and present updated results for the subgroup of patients with CNS haemangioblastomas. In the multicentre, single-arm, phase 2 LITESPARK-004 study, adults (aged ≥18 years) from 11 cancer centres or hospitals in the USA, Denmark, France, and the UK, with germline VHL alterations, at least one measurable renal cell carcinoma tumour, no renal cell carcinoma tumour greater than 3 cm requiring immediate surgical intervention, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0 or 1, and no previous systemic therapy received oral belzutifan 120 mg once daily until unacceptable toxicity, disease progression, or patient decision to withdraw. The primary endpoint, evaluated in patients with CNS haemangioblastomas, was the proportion of patients with an objective response per RECIST version 1.1 by an independent review committee. We assessed response using two approaches. In approach 1, we evaluated all measurable (≥1 cm maximum diameter) or non-measurable lesions at baseline, including both the solid lesion and the associated cystic component if present. In approach 2, we evaluated only baseline lesions with a measurable (≥1 cm maximum diameter) solid lesion. Antitumour activity was assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of belzutifan. This study is no longer recruiting but is ongoing, and is registered with Clinicaltrials.gov, NCT03401788. Between May 31, 2018, and March 29, 2019, of 67 patients screened, 61 (32 [52%] male and 29 [48%] female) were enrolled; 50 (82%) had at least one CNS haemangioblastoma evaluable at baseline (184 total lesions). Median follow-up for the 50 patients with CNS haemangioblastomas was 38·0 months (IQR 36·7-40·1). In approach 1, 22 of 50 patients (44% [95% CI 30-59]) had an objective response. In approach 2, 19 of 25 patients (76% [55-91] had an objective response. 23 (46%) of 50 patients had a grade 3-5 all-cause adverse event. 19 (38%) patients reported grade 3 adverse events, the most common of which was anaemia (in 6 [12%] patients). Two of 50 patients (4%) reported grade 4 events (retinal vein occlusion and embolism). Two patients died owing to adverse events not considered treatment-related (suicide and toxicity to various agents). Belzutifan showed meaningful antitumour activity in VHL disease-associated CNS haemangioblastomas that was sustained for more than 3 years of treatment. These results continue to support belzutifan as a systemic treatment option for patients with VHL disease-related CNS haemangioblastomas.

    "abstract": "Early indicators of metastatic cancer response to therapy are important for evaluating new drugs and stopping ineffective treatment. The RECIST guidelines based on repeat cancer imaging are widely adopted in clinical trials, are used to identify active regimens that may change practice, and contribute to regulatory approvals. However, these criteria do not provide insight before 6 to 12 weeks of treatment and typically require that patients have measurable disease. Recent data suggest that measuring on-treatment changes in the amount or proportion of ctDNA in peripheral blood plasma may accurately identify responding and nonresponding cancers at earlier time points. Over the past year, the RECIST working group has evaluated current evidence for plasma ctDNA kinetics as a treatment response biomarker in metastatic cancers and early endpoint in clinical trials to identify areas of focus for future research and validation. Here, we outline the requirement for large standardized trial datasets, greater scrutiny of optimal ctDNA collection time points and assay thresholds, and consideration of regulatory body guidelines and patient opinions. In particular, clinically meaningful changes in plasma ctDNA abundance are likely to differ by cancer type and therapy class and must be assessed before ctDNA can be considered a potential pan-cancer response evaluation biomarker. Despite the need for additional data, minimally invasive on-treatment ctDNA measurements hold promise to build upon existing response assessments such as RECIST and offer opportunities for developing novel early endpoints for modern clinical trials.",

    "abstract": "BXQ-350, a nanovesicle formulation of saposin C, is an allosteric sphingolipid metabolism regulator that increases proapoptotic ceramide and decreases oncogenic sphingosine-1-phosphate levels. We conducted a first-in-human phase I study of BXQ-350. Adults (≥18 years old) with advanced/recurrent, treatment-refractory solid tumors or high-grade gliomas received BXQ-350 intravenously in five dose cohorts (0.7-2.4 mg/kg) in a 3+3 dose escalation and expansion design. The primary endpoints during dose escalation were dose-limiting toxicities and maximum tolerated dose; the primary objective in expansion parts was assessment of antitumor activity (RECIST v1.1/Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology criteria). Eighty-six patients were enrolled. Dose-limiting toxicities were not observed during dose escalation (n = 18), and a maximum tolerated dose was not identified. An additional 68 patients received the 2.4 mg/kg dose. Nine patients (10%) discontinued due to adverse events. The most common treatment-related adverse events were nausea (24%) and fatigue (23%). Eight patients had a progression-free survival of ≥6 months. Two of these achieved a partial response, and six had stable disease, among whom three had a reduction in ≥1 target lesion. Of those with progression-free survival of ≥6 months, seven remained on study for >12 months, five for >24 months, and after 7 years, two remained on study without disease progression. BXQ-350 was well-tolerated as monotherapy at doses up to 2.4 mg/kg. It provided some lasting clinical benefit in patients with recurrent solid malignancies across several tumor types, consistent with a decreased systemic sphingosine-1-phosphate/ceramide metabolic rheostat. BXQ-350 warrants further clinical investigation alone and combined with standard of care for advanced solid tumors.",

T-DXd data were pooled from DESTINY-Breast01/-02/-03. Comparator data, from patients receiving physician's choice therapy and trastuzumab emtansine, were pooled from DESTINY-Breast02 and -03, respectively. Baseline BM status was assessed according to US Food and Drug Administration criteria. The endpoints included intracranial objective response rate (ORR; complete or partial response in the brain) per blinded independent central review (BICR) by RECIST version 1.1, time to intracranial response, intracranial duration of response (DoR), central nervous system progression-free survival (CNS-PFS) by BICR, overall survival (OS), and safety. A total of 148 patients who received T-DXd and 83 patients who received comparator treatment had BMs at baseline. In those treated with T-DXd, the intracranial ORR of patients with treated/stable and untreated/active BMs was 45.2% and 45.5%, respectively. The median (range) time to intracranial response was 2.8 months (1.1-13.9 months) and 1.5 months (1.2-13.7 months) in patients with treated/stable and untreated/active BMs, respectively. For those with treated/stable BMs, the median intracranial DoR was 12.3 [95% confidence interval (CI) 9.1-17.9] months, and for those with untreated/active BMs, it was 17.5 months (95% CI 13.6-31.6 months). The median CNS-PFS and OS were 12.3 months (95% CI 11.1-13.8 months) and not reached (95% CI 22.1 months-not estimable) in those with treated/stable BMs, and 18.5 months (95% CI 13.6-23.3 months) and 30.2 months (95% CI 21.3 months-not estimable) in those with untreated/active BMs, respectively. Drug-related treatment-emergent adverse events grade ≥3 were experienced by 43.2% of patients with BMs and 46.4% without BMs with T-DXd.

However, whether the belzutifan dose could be optimized is unclear. The phase II LITESPARK-013 study (NCT04489771) enrolled patients with advanced clear cell RCC whose disease progressed after one to three prior systemic therapies, including an anti-PD-(L)1 regimen. Patients were randomly assigned 1 : 1 to receive belzutifan 120 or 200 mg once daily. The primary endpoint was the objective response rate (ORR) per RECIST version 1.1. The secondary endpoints were duration of response (DOR), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and safety. Overall, 154 patients were enrolled (120 mg: n = 76; 200 mg: n = 78). The median follow-up was 20.1 months (range 14.8-28.4). The ORR was 23.7% versus 23.1% for the 120 mg and 200 mg groups, respectively [P = 0.5312; -0.5%, 95% confidence interval (CI) -14.0% to 12.9%]. The median DOR was not reached for the 120 mg arm and was 16.1 months (2.1+ to 23.5+) for the 200 mg arm. No between-group differences were observed for PFS [hazard ratio (HR) 0.94, 95% CI 0.63-1.40] or OS (medians not reached; HR 1.11, 95% CI 0.65-1.90). Grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse events were observed in 35 patients (46.1%) in the 120 mg group and 36 patients (46.2%) in the 200 mg group. The efficacy of belzutifan was similar between the 120 mg dose and the 200 mg dose for previously treated clear cell RCC. Safety at both doses was consistent with the known safety profile of belzutifan. These results further support 120 mg once daily as the preferred dose for belzutifan.",

    "abstract": "Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have revolutionized cancer care; however, accompanying immune-related adverse events (irAEs) confer substantial morbidity and occasional mortality. Life-threatening irAEs may require permanent cessation of ICI, even in patients with positive tumor response. Therefore, it is imperative to comprehensively define the spectrum of irAEs to aid individualized decision-making around the initiation of ICI therapy. To define incidence, risk factors, and clinical spectrum of an irreversible and life-threatening irAE: ICI-induced diabetes. This cohort study, conducted at an academic integrated health care system examined 14 328 adult patients treated with ICIs, including 64 patients who developed ICI-induced diabetes, from July 2010 to January 2022. The data were analyzed from 2022 to 2023. Cases of ICI-induced diabetes were manually confirmed; detailed clinical phenotyping was performed at diagnosis and 1-year follow-up. For 862 patients, genotyping data were available, and polygenic risk for type 1 diabetes was determined. For ICI-induced diabetes cases and controls, demographic characteristics, comorbidities, tumor category, and ICI category were compared. Among ICI-induced diabetes cases, markers of glycemic physiology were examined at diagnosis and 1-year follow-up. For patients with available genotyping, a published type 1 diabetes polygenic score (T1D GRS2) was calculated. Of 14 328 participants, 6571 (45.9%) were women, and the median (range) age was 66 (8-106) years. The prevalence of ICI-induced diabetes among ICI-treated patients was 0.45% (64 of 14 328), with an incidence of 124.8 per 100 000 person-years. Preexisting type 2 diabetes (odds ratio [OR], 5.91; 95% CI, 3.34-10.45) and treatment with combination ICI (OR, 2.57; 95% CI, 1.44-4.59) were significant clinical risk factors of ICI-induced diabetes. T1D GRS2 was associated with ICI-induced diabetes risk, with an OR of 4.4 (95% CI, 1.8-10.5) for patients in the top decile of T1D GRS2, demonstrating a genetic association between spontaneous autoimmunity and irAEs. Patients with ICI-induced diabetes were in 3 distinct phenotypic categories based on autoantibodies and residual pancreatic function, with varying severity of initial presentation. The results of this analysis of 14 328 ICI-treated patients followed up from ICI initiation determined the incidence, risk factors and clinical spectrum of ICI-induced diabetes. Widespread implementation of this approach across organ-specific irAEs may enhance diagnosis and management of these conditions, and this becomes especially pertinent as ICI treatment rapidly expands to treat a wide spectrum of cancers and is used at earlier stages of treatment.",

    "abstract": "Background Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NCT) is gaining acceptance for the management of locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) in patients without negative prognostic factors. However, the value of MRI in evaluating tumor response after NCT remains unclear. Purpose To investigate the accuracy of MRI in assessing pathologic complete response in participants with LARC who underwent surgery after NCT without radiation. Materials and Methods A retrospective imaging substudy was conducted within two consecutive prospective clinical trials: the expanded phase II trial (from December 2017 to May 2021) and the COPEC trial (comparison of tumor response to two or four cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy alone, ongoing from August 2021). All included participants received four cycles of capecitabine combined with oxaliplatin (or CAPOX) before surgery. Three radiologists who were blinded to the clinicopathologic data independently evaluated the tumor response using five methods, namely, MR tumor regression grade (MR-TRG) alone, diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) alone, DWI-modified MR-TRG (DWImodMR-TRG), MRI complete response, and radiologic neoadjuvant response score. With pathologic assessment serving as the reference standard, the positive and negative predictive values, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) were determined to evaluate the accuracy and performance of these models. The AUCs of the models were compared using the DeLong test. Results A total of 224 participants were included, comprising 119 from the expanded phase II trial (median age, 61 years [IQR, 53-67]; 89 male) and 105 from the COPEC trial (median age, 59 years [IQR, 53-67]; 65 male). MR-TRG, DWI, DWImodMR-TRG, MRI complete response, and the radiologic neoadjuvant response score were associated with pathologic complete response. DWImodMR-TRG achieved the highest AUC of 0.90 (95% CI: 0.85, 0.95), with a specificity of 89% (162 of 182) and a negative predictive value of 93% (162 of 174). Conclusion MRI-based models were accurate for determining pathologic complete response in participants with LARC following NCT.

To investigate CNS activity with lazertinib, a third-generation EGFR TKI. This multicenter single-arm, phase 2 nonrandomized controlled trial was conducted in South Korea and included patients with EGFR-variant NSCLC who had asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic brain metastases after unsuccessful treatment with first-generation or second-generation EGFR TKIs. Data were collected from June 2021 to April 2022, with a data cutoff date of December 15, 2022. Lazertinib, 240 mg, once daily. The primary end point was intracranial objective response rate (iORR) in the evaluable population according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours version 1.1 assessed by the investigators. Secondary end points included intracranial progression-free survival (iPFS) and iORR in patients with T790M-negative disease and isolated CNS progression as well as overall ORR, duration of response, intracranial duration of response, disease control rate, overall survival, cerebrospinal fluid penetration of lazertinib, and safety. Among 40 included patients, 25 (63%) were women, and the median (range) age was 63 (29-85) years. A total of 38 patients were evaluable for tumor response, including 12 patients with leptomeningeal metastases. At data cutoff, the median (range) follow-up was 13.6 (2.9-17.7) months. The iORR for the evaluable population was 55% (21 of 38; 95% CI, 38.3-71.4); for patients with T790M-positive disease, 80% (4 of 5; 95% CI, 28.4-99.5); for patients with T790M-negative disease, 43% (9 of 21; 95% CI, 21.8-66.0); and for patients with T790M-unknown disease, 67% (8 of 12; 95% CI, 34.9-90.1). The median iPFS was 15.8 months (95% CI, 15.2-not reached) for the evaluable population, 15.2 months (95% CI, 4.2-not reached) for the T790M-positive subgroup, 15.4 months (95% CI, 7.9-not reached) for the T790M-negative subgroup, and 18.0 months (95% CI, 3.9-not reached) for the T790M-unknown subgroup. The cerebrospinal fluid penetration rate of lazertinib was 46.2% (95% CI, 10.0-49.6), providing further support for its mechanism of intracranial response. Most adverse events were grade 1 or 2. In this study, lazertinib had substantial CNS activity, regardless of T790M status, against the progression of intracranial metastases with or without leptomeningeal metastases after unsuccessful treatment with first-generation or second-generation EGFR TKIs in patients with metastatic EGFR-variant NSCLC. These results suggest that using lazertinib instead of brain local treatment could be a potential strategy in patients with EGFR-variant NSCLC whose CNS metastases progressed after prior EGFR TKI treatment.

    "abstract": "Assessing the response to oncological treatments is paramount for determining the prognosis and defining the best treatment for each patient. Several biomarkers, including imaging, can be used, but standardization is fundamental for consistency and reliability. Tumor response evaluation criteria have been defined by international groups for application in pharmaceutical clinical trials evaluating new drugs or therapeutic strategies. RECIST 1.1 criteria are exclusively based on unidimensional lesion measurements; changes in tumor size are used as surrogate imaging biomarkers to correlate with patient outcomes. However, increased tumor size does not always reflect tumor progression. The introduction of immunotherapy has led to the development of new criteria (iRECIST, Level of Evidence (LoE) Ib) that consider the possibility that an increase in disease burden is secondary to the immune response instead of progression, with the new concept of Unconfirmed Progressive Disease (a first progression event which must be confirmed on follow-up). Specific criteria were devised for HCC (mRECIST, LoE IV), which measure only enhancing HCC portions to account for changes after local therapy. For GIST treated with imatinib, criteria were developed to account for the possible increase in size reflecting a response rather than a progression by assessing both tumor size and density on CT (Choi, LoE II). This article provides concise and relevant practice recommendations aimed at general radiologists to help choose and apply the most appropriate criteria for assessing response to treatment in different oncologic scenarios. Though these criteria were developed for clinical trials, they may be applied in clinical practice as a guide for day-to-day interpretation. KEY POINTS: Response evaluation criteria, designed for use in clinical trials, might serve as a surrogate biomarker for overall survival. RECIST 1.1 defines measurable and non-measurable disease among which target lesions and non-target lesions are selected at baseline as reference for follow-ups. Some therapies and/or cancers require the use of different criteria, such as iRECIST, mRECIST, and Choi criteria.",

    "abstract": "Background A watch-and-wait regimen for locally advanced rectal cancer after neoadjuvant chemotherapy and radiation therapy (NCRT) relies on identifying complete tumor response. However, the concordance between a complete response at combined T2-weighted and diffusion-weighted MRI (T2DWI) and pathologic complete response (pCR; ie, ypT0N0) in the tumor is unsatisfactory. Purpose To assess whether identification of mucosal linear enhancement (MLE) at arterial-phase contrast-enhanced (CE) T1-weighted MRI is associated with ypT0 status in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer after NCRT and to evaluate whether combining MLE at CE T1-weighted MRI and negative lymph node metastasis (LNM) at T2DWI can improve identification of pCR. Materials and Methods This retrospective study included patients with locally advanced rectal cancer who underwent total mesorectal excision after NCRT between July 2020 and July 2023 at a tertiary referral academic center. Restaging MRI included T2DWI and arterial-phase CE T1-weighted MRI for primary tumor assessment and T2DWI for evaluation of LNM status. Imaging features associated with ypT0 status were identified at multivariable regression analysis. Results In total, 239 patients (mean age, 58 years ± 12 [SD]; 180 male patients) were assessed. MLE was more common in the ypT0 group than in the ypT1-4 group after NCRT (73% vs 4%, respectively; ",

    "abstract": "Metastatic Pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas (PPGLs) are rare neuroendocrine tumors characterized by high morbidity and limited systemic treatment options, mainly based on radiometabolic treatments or chemotherapy. Based on the preclinical rationale that PGGLs carcinogenesis relies on angiogenesis, treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) may represent another viable therapeutic option. We conducted a prospective phase II study in patients with metastatic or unresectable PGGLs. Patients received sunitinib (50 mg daily for 4 weeks, followed by a 2-week rest period) until progressive disease (PD), unacceptable toxicity or consent withdrawal. The primary endpoint was 12-month progression-free survival (PFS) rate; secondary endpoints were safety overall response rate (ORR) according to RECIST 1.1 criteria and overall survival (OS). EudraCT Number: 2011-002632-99. Fifty patients were included. At a median follow-up of 71.7 months (IQR 35.4-100.1), the 1 year-PFS rate was 53.4 % (95 %CI 41.1-69.3) and median PFS was 14.1 months (95 % CI 8.9-25.7). ORR was 15.6 %, the median OS was 49.4 months (95 %CI 21.2-NA), and grade 3 or higher treatment-related adverse events were reported in 34 % patients. No significant correlation was found between specific genetic alterations or genomic clusters and sunitinib efficacy. Sunitinib is an active drug in patients with advanced PGGLs, capable of inducing prolonged disease control with a manageable toxicity profile.",

EXTEND (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03599765) is a multicenter, phase II basket trial randomly assigning patients with ≤five metastases 1:1 to MDT plus systemic therapy versus systemic therapy. Disease progression was defined by radiologic criteria (RECIST v1.1), clinical progression, or death.

We report efficacy and safety of sacituzumab govitecan (SG), a trophoblast cell-surface antigen 2 (Trop-2)-directed antibody-drug conjugate, in patients with advanced EC. TROPiCS-03 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03964727) is a multicohort, open-label, phase II basket study in patients with metastatic solid tumors. Eligible patients in the EC cohort received SG 10 mg/kg once on days 1 and 8 every 3 weeks. Primary end point was objective response rate (ORR) by investigator's assessment per RECIST v1.1. Secondary end points included clinical benefit rate (CBR; complete and partial response, and stable disease ≥6 months), duration of response (DOR), and progression-free survival (PFS) per investigator assessment, overall survival, and safety. Trop-2 expression of archival or baseline tumor specimens was analyzed by immunohistochemistry. At data extraction date, 41 patients were enrolled. Median follow-up was 5.8 months (range, 0.7-19.3); median previous therapies was three (range, 1-6); and 85% of patients received previous chemotherapy and immunotherapy.

    "abstract": "Approximately 40% of patients with colorectal cancer will develop liver metastases. Hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) represents a valuable treatment option, with curative, palliative, or adjuvant intent. The aim of our study was to describe technical considerations, safety, and oncological outcomes of patients receiving HAIC. All patients who underwent percutaneous hepatic arterial port placement in our institution between 2004 and 2021 were included in this retrospective analysis. Demographic, anatomical and technical data were collected. Tumor response was assessed using RECIST 1.1. Kaplan-Meier estimates were used for overall survival (OS) and hepatic progression-free survival (PFS). Adverse events (AEs) were graded using the Clavien-Dindo classification. A total of 360 patients (median age, 58.6 years [interquartile range (IQR): 49.5-65.4]; 208 men [57.8%]) were included. Percutaneous hepatic arterial port placement was successful in 87.9% of cases, resulting in 379 port placements (431 attempts). Overall, 394 HAIC courses were delivered, mostly oxaliplatin-based (94.7%), with a median of 6 cycles per course (IQR: 3-8). AEs (all grades) were observed in 42.0% of ports (grade IIIb-V: 1.1%). Most port dysfunctions could be resolved, resulting in a 73.1% rate of HAIC resumption, without impact on OS. Median OS was 22 months (IQR: 18-24), and median hepatic PFS was 11 months (IQR: 9.5-13). Tumor downstaging allowed surgery in 35.6% of patients, with significantly longer median OS than non-operated patients (39 months [IQR: 33-79] versus 14 months [IQR: 12-16], p < 0.001). This retrospective cohort study demonstrates the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of percutaneous hepatic arterial port placement with an impact on survival for selected patients. Percutaneous hepatic arterial port placement is feasible, safe and effective with an impact on the survival of selected patients. Hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy provides promising tumor response and overall survival, especially in cases of resection/ablation. Total complication rate of hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy port use is high, but serious complications are rare. Port revision is often necessary but allows the resumption of hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy without affecting overall survival.",

This retrospective study included advanced HCC patients treated with ≥ 3 cycles of atezo-bev. Two reviewers assessed responses using RECIST 1.1, mRECIST, and Choi criteria at 1st follow-up imaging. Kaplan-Meier curves with log-rank tests evaluated and compared PFS and OS. Cox proportional hazard models identified survival outcome predictors. Kappa statistics assessed inter-reader agreement. We evaluated 77 patients (65 men; mean age, 62.8 ± 12.3 years). Choi's criteria revealed the highest early responders rate (53.2%), exceeding mRECIST (32.5-33.8%) and RECIST 1.1 (24.7-26.0%), with an excellent agreement in all criteria (κ, 0.85-0.95). Across criteria, a consistent number of patients progressed (23-26) and was associated with significantly poor OS (ps ≤ 0.049). Responders by any criteria showed longer PFS (ps ≤ 0.009), and 1-year OS (ps ≤ 0.01). Choi criteria linked to significantly better OS without landmark (p = 0.003), with 1-year OS rates at 76.9% for responders vs 38.1% for non-responders. Cox analysis identified responders by Choi criteria as a significant OS predictor. Choi criteria identified more early responders than RECIST 1.1 and mRECIST, significantly correlating with improved OS. Choi criteria could be considered as a formal response assessment criterion for the emerging atezo-bev systemic treatment. For atezo-bev treatment of advanced HCC, more comprehensive response criteria, such as Choi criteria, could be effective in identifying early responders and predicting survival outcomes along with RECIST 1.1 and mRECIST. Choi criteria identified a higher rate of early responders compared to mRECIST and RECIST1.1 following atezo-bev treatment. Responders by all criteria had longer PFS and 1-year OS, and only those by Choi criteria experienced longer OS without landmark time. Choi criteria, with RECIST 1.1 and mRECIST, is an effective response assessment tool for atezo-bev treatment.",

Patients with HCC who underwent immunotherapy between 2017 and 2023 and received multi-phasic contrast-enhanced MRIs pre- and post-treatment were included in this retrospective study. Tumor response was measured using 1D, RECIST 1.1, and mRECIST, and 3D, volumetric, and percentage quantitative EASL (vqEASL and %qEASL). Patients were grouped into disease control vs progression and responders vs non-responders. Kaplan-Meier curves analyzed with log-rank tests assessed the predictive value for mOS.

Patients (n = 36) with GEA were treated with standard-of-care chemotherapy (n = 17) or HER-Vaxx plus chemotherapy (n = 19), using the recommended phase 2 dose for the vaccine. Overall survival (OS; primary endpoint), safety, progression-free survival (PFS), clinical response (secondary endpoints), and vaccine-induced HER2-specific antibody levels in serum and correlation with tumor response rates (exploratory endpoints) were investigated. A 40% OS benefit [HR, 0.60; median OS, 13.9 months; 80% confidence interval (CI), 7.52-14.32] for patients treated with HER-Vaxx plus chemotherapy compared with OS of 8.31 months (80% CI, 6.01-9.59) in patients that received chemotherapy alone. A 20% PFS difference was obtained for the vaccination arm (HR, 0.80; 80% CI, 0.47, 1.38). No additional toxicity due to HER-Vaxx was observed. The vaccine-induced high levels of HER2-specific total IgG and IgG1 antibodies (P < 0.001 vs. controls) that significantly correlated with tumor reduction (IgG, P = 0.001; IgG1, P = 0.016), had a significant capacity in inhibiting phosphorylation of the intracellular HER2-signaling pathways, mediated antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, and decreased immunosuppressive FOXP3+ regulatory T cells. HER-Vaxx plus standard chemotherapy exhibits an excellent safety profile and improves OS.

Primary endpoints were the 12 weeks-Disease Control Rate (12w-DCR) by investigator assessment per RECIST v1.1 and safety per CTCAE v5.0. Additional endpoints included overall response rate (ORR), progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Patients' serum samples were subject to NGS miRNome profiling in comparison with healthy donors to reveal differentially expressed miRNAs as candidate circulating biomarkers.

This first-in-human, multicenter, open-label phase I/II study of vimseltinib in patients with malignant solid tumors (N = 37) or TGCT not amenable to surgery (N = 32) followed a pharmacologically guided 3 + 3 study design (NCT03069469). The primary objectives were to assess safety and tolerability, determine the recommended phase II dose, and characterize the pharmacokinetics; exploratory objectives included pharmacodynamics and efficacy. Vimseltinib was well tolerated; the majority of non-laboratory treatment-emergent adverse events were of grade 1/2 severity. There was no evidence of cholestatic hepatotoxicity or drug-induced liver injury. The recommended phase II dose was determined to be 30 mg twice weekly (no loading dose), and vimseltinib plasma exposure increased with the dose. In patients with TGCT, the median treatment duration was 25.1 months (range, 0.7-46.9), and the objective response rate as assessed by independent radiological review using RECIST version 1.1 was 72%. Vimseltinib demonstrated long-term tolerability, manageable safety, dose-dependent exposure, and robust antitumor activity in patients with TGCT not amenable to surgery.",

    "abstract": "To inform prognosis, treatment response, disease biology, and KRAS G12C mutation heterogeneity, we conducted exploratory circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) profiling on 134 patients with solid tumors harboring a KRAS G12C mutation treated with single-agent divarasib (GDC-6036) in a phase 1 study. Plasma samples were collected for serial ctDNA profiling at baseline (cycle 1 day 1 prior to treatment) and multiple on-treatment time points (cycle 1 day 15 and cycle 3 day 1). KRAS G12C ctDNA was detectable from plasma samples in 72.9% (43/59) and 92.6% (50/54) of patients with non-small cell lung cancer and colorectal cancer, respectively, the majority of whom were eligible for study participation based on a local test detecting the KRAS G12C mutation in tumor tissue. Baseline ctDNA tumor fraction was associated with tumor type, disease burden, and metastatic sites. A decline in ctDNA level was observed as early as cycle 1 day 15. Serial assessment showed a decline in ctDNA tumor fraction associated with response and progression-free survival. Except for a few cases of KRAS G12C sub-clonality, on-treatment changes in KRAS G12C variant allele frequency mirrored changes in the overall ctDNA tumor fraction. Across tumor types, the KRAS G12C mutation likely represents a truncal mutation in the majority of patients. Rapid and deep decline in ctDNA tumor fraction was observed in patients responding to divarasib treatment. Early on-treatment dynamics of ctDNA were associated with patient outcomes and tumor response to divarasib treatment.",

TACTI-002 (part C) evaluated whether combining efti with pembrolizumab led to strong antitumor responses in patients with second-line recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (R/M HNSCC) while demonstrating good tolerability. In this multinational phase II trial using Simon's two-stage design, patients who were PD-L(1)-naïve with R/M HNSCC who had failed first-line platinum-based therapy, unselected for PD-L1, received intravenous pembrolizumab (200 mg, once every 2 weeks) combined with subcutaneous efti (30 mg once every 2 weeks for 24 weeks and once every 3 weeks thereafter). The primary endpoint was objective response rate per RECIST 1.1 modified for immune-based therapy by investigator assessment. Additional endpoints included duration of response, progression-free survival, overall survival, and tolerability. Pharmacodynamic effects (absolute lymphocyte count) and Th1 cytokine biomarkers (IFNγ/CXCL10)] were evaluated in liquid biopsies. Between March 2019 and January 2021, 39 patients were enrolled; 37 were evaluated for response. All patients received prior chemotherapy, and 40.5% were pretreated with cetuximab; 53.1% of patients had PD-L1 combined positive score <20. With a median follow-up of 38.8 months, the objective response rate was 29.7%, including 13.5% complete responders. The median duration of response was not reached. Rapid and sustained absolute lymphocyte count increase was observed in patients who had an objective response. Th1 biomarkers increased sustainably after first treatment. No unexpected safety signals were observed. Efti plus pembrolizumab was safe and showed encouraging antitumor activity and pharmacodynamic effects in patients with second-line head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), thus supporting further evaluation of this combination in earlier treatment lines.",

Eligible patients with clinical T3-4 and/or N+ rectal adenocarcinoma were randomly assigned to group A for short-course radiotherapy (SCRT) followed by six cycles of consolidation immunochemotherapy with capecitabine and oxaliplatin and toripalimab or to group B for two cycles of induction immunochemotherapy followed by SCRT and the rest four doses. Either total mesorectal excision or WW was applied on the basis of tumor response.

We define the genomic features, clinical course, and response to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) in patients with MSI-H/dMMR and TMB-H prostate cancers without MSI [TMB-H/microsatellite stable (MSS)]. We sequenced 3,244 tumors from 2,257 patients with prostate cancer. MSI-H/dMMR prostate cancer was defined as an MSIsensor score ≥10 or MSIsensor score ≥3 and <10 with a deleterious MMR alteration. TMB-H was defined as ≥10 mutations/megabase. PSA50 and RECIST responses were assigned. Overall survival and radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) were compared using log-rank test. Sixty-three (2.8%) men had MSI-H/dMMR, and 33 (1.5%) had TMB-H/MSS prostate cancers. Patients with MSI-H/dMMR and TMB-H/MSS tumors more commonly presented with grade group 5 and metastatic disease at diagnosis. MSI-H/dMMR tumors had higher TMB, indel, and neoantigen burden compared with TMB-H/MSS. Twenty-seven patients with MSI-H/dMMR and 8 patients with TMB-H/MSS tumors received ICB, none of whom harbored polymerase epsilon (polE) catalytic subunit mutations. About 45% of patients with MSI-H/dMMR had a RECIST response, and 65% had a PSA50 response. No patient with TMB-H/MSS had a RECIST response, and 50% had a PSA50 response. rPFS tended to be longer in patients with MSI-H/dMMR than in patients with TMB-H/MSS who received immunotherapy. Pronounced differences in genomics, TMB, or MSIsensor score were not detected between MSI-H/dMMR responders and nonresponders. MSI-H/dMMR prostate cancers have greater TMB, indel, and neoantigen burden than TMB-H/MSS prostate cancers, and these differences may contribute to profound and durable responses to ICB.",

The primary endpoint was the overall response rate (ORR) according to RECIST v1.1 by an independent central radiology review in the first 24 response-evaluable (RE) patients who had been observed at least 24 weeks from study initiation (primary RE patients). The efficacy was to be declared when at least 8 of the 24 primary RE patients responded. A total of 31 patients were enrolled. In the first 24 primary RE patients with a median follow-up of 7.4 months, confirmed ORR by independent central radiology review was 25.0% [6/24 patients; 95% confidence interval, 9.8%-46.7%; P = 0.11 (one-sided)], which did not meet the predefined criteria of efficacy. Clinical benefit rate (ORR + rate of stable disease for at least 24 weeks) and median progression-free survival were 50.0% and 7.4 months, respectively.

We collected data from patients with BRAF fusion-positive cancers identified through a genotyping protocol of 97,024 samples. Fusions were characterized and reviewed for oncogenic potential (in-frame status, non-BRAF partner gene, and intact BRAF kinase domain). We found 241 BRAF fusion-positive tumors from 212 patients with 82 unique 5' fusion partners spanning 52 histologies. Thirty-nine fusion partners were not previously reported, and 61 were identified once. BRAF fusion incidence was enriched in pilocytic astrocytomas, gangliogliomas, low-grade neuroepithelial tumors, and acinar cell carcinoma of the pancreas. Twenty-four patients spanning multiple histologies were treated with MAPK-directed therapies, of which 20 were evaluable for RECIST. Best response was partial response (N = 2), stable disease (N = 11), and progressive disease (N = 7). The median time on therapy was 1 month with MEK plus BRAF inhibitors [(N = 11), range 0-18 months] and 8 months for MEK inhibitors [(N = 14), range 1-26 months]. Nine patients remained on treatment for longer than 6 months [pilocytic astrocytomas (N = 6), Erdheim-Chester disease (N = 1), extraventricular neurocytoma (N = 1), and melanoma (N = 1)]. Fifteen patients had acquired BRAF fusions. BRAF fusions are found across histologies and represent an emerging actionable target. BRAF fusions have a diverse set of fusion partners. Durable responses to MAPK therapies were seen, particularly in pilocytic astrocytomas. Acquired BRAF fusions were identified after targeted therapy, underscoring the importance of postprogression biopsies to optimize treatment at relapse in these patients.",

Fianlimab and cemiplimab are high-affinity, human, hinge-stabilized IgG4 monoclonal antibodies, targeting LAG-3 and PD-1, respectively. We report results from a first-in-human phase-I study of fianlimab and cemiplimab safety and efficacy in various malignancies including advanced melanoma. Patients with advanced melanoma were eligible for enrollment into four cohorts: three for patients without and one for patients with previous anti-PD-1 therapy in the advanced disease setting. Patients were treated with fianlimab 1,600 mg and cemiplimab 350 mg intravenously once every 3 weeks for up to 51 weeks, with an optional additional 51 weeks if clinically indicated. The primary end point was objective response rate (ORR) per RECIST 1.1 criteria. ORRs were 63% for patients with anti-PD-1-naïve melanoma (cohort-6; n = 40; median follow-up 20.8 months), 63% for patients with systemic treatment-naïve melanoma (cohort-15; n = 40; 11.5 months), and 56% for patients with previous neo/adjuvant treatment melanoma (cohort-16; n = 18, 9.7 months). At a median follow-up of 12.6 months for the combined cohorts (6 + 15 + 16), the ORR was 61.2% and the median progression-free survival (mPFS) 13.3 months (95% CI, 7.5 to not estimated [NE]). In patients (n = 13) with previous anti-PD-1 adjuvant therapy, ORR was 61.5% and mPFS 12 months (95% CI, 1.4 to NE).

Antiangiogenic drugs, including ramucirumab, have shown activity in previously treated patients. The RELEVENT trial was designed to evaluate the activity and safety of ramucirumab plus chemotherapy as first-line treatment in advanced TC. This phase II trial was conducted within the Italian TYME network. Eligible patients had treatment-naïve advanced TC. They received ramucirumab, carboplatin and paclitaxel for six cycles, followed by ramucirumab maintenance until disease progression or intolerable toxicity. Primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR) according to RECIST v1.1 as assessed by the investigator. Secondary endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS) and safety. Centralized radiologic review was carried out. From November 2018 to June 2023, 52 patients were screened and 35 were enrolled. Median age was 60.8 years, 71.4% of patients were male and 85.7% had Masaoka-Koga stage IVB. The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status was 0 in 68.5% and 1 in 31.4% of patients. At the present analysis carried out some months after the interim analysis (earlier than expected) on 35 patients, ORR was 80.0% [95% confidence interval (CI) 63.1% to 91.6%]. At the centralized radiological review of 33/35 assessable patients, ORR was 57.6% (95% CI 39.2% to 74.5%).

Thirty-two out of 35 patients (91.4%) experienced at least one treatment-related adverse event (AE), of which 48.6% were AE ≥ grade 3. In previously untreated advanced TC, the addition of ramucirumab to carboplatin and paclitaxel showed the highest activity compared to historical controls, with a manageable safety profile.

Patients were randomized 1 : 1 : 1 to arm A [nivolumab 1 mg/kg plus ipilimumab 3 mg/kg Q3W (four doses)] or arm B [nivolumab 3 mg/kg plus ipilimumab 1 mg/kg Q3W (four doses)], each followed by nivolumab 240 mg Q2W, or arm C (nivolumab 3 mg/kg Q2W plus ipilimumab 1 mg/kg Q6W). The primary objectives were safety, tolerability, investigator-assessed objective response rate (ORR), and duration of response (DOR) per RECIST version 1.1. A total of 148 patients were randomized across treatment arms. At 60-month minimum follow-up (62.6-month median follow-up), the ORR was 34% (n = 17), 27% (n = 13), and 29% (n = 14) in arms A, B, and C, respectively. The median DOR was 51.2 months [95% confidence interval (CI) 12.6 months-not estimable (NE)], 15.2 months (95% CI 7.1 months-NE), and 21.7 months (95% CI 4.2 months-NE), respectively. The median overall survival (OS) was 22.2 months (34/50; 95% CI 9.4-54.8 months) in arm A, 12.5 months (38/49; 95% CI 7.6-16.4 months) in arm B, and 12.7 months (40/49; 95% CI 7.4-30.5 months) in arm C; 60-month OS rates were 29%, 19%, and 21%, respectively. In an exploratory analysis of OS by response (6-month landmark), the median OS was meaningfully longer for responders versus nonresponders for all arms. No new safety signals were identified with longer follow-up. There were no new discontinuations due to immune-mediated adverse events since the primary analysis. Consistent with the primary analysis, the arm A regimen of nivolumab plus ipilimumab continued to demonstrate clinically meaningful responses and long-term survival benefit, with no new safety signals in patients with advanced HCC following sorafenib treatment, further supporting its use as a second-line treatment in these patients.",

    "abstract": "POLE and POLD1 proofreading deficiency (POLE/D1pd) define a rare subtype of ultramutated metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC; over 100 mut/Mb). Disease-specific data about the activity and efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in POLE/D1pd mCRC are lacking and it is unknown whether outcomes may be different from mismatch repair-deficient (dMMR)/microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) mCRCs treated with ICIs. In this global study, we collected 27 patients with mCRC harboring POLE/D1 mutations leading to proofreading deficiency and treated with anti-programmed cell death-ligand 1 alone +/- anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 agents. We collected clinicopathological and genomic characteristics, response, and survival outcomes after ICIs of POLE/D1pd mCRC and compared them with a cohort of 610 dMMR/MSI-H mCRC patients treated with ICIs. Further genomic analyses were carried out in an independent cohort of 7241 CRCs to define POLE and POLD1pd molecular profiles and mutational signatures. POLE/D1pd was associated with younger age, male sex, fewer RAS/BRAF driver mutations, and predominance of right-sided colon cancers. Patients with POLE/D1pd mCRC showed a significantly higher overall response rate (ORR) compared to dMMR/MSI-H mCRC (89% versus 54%; P = 0.01). After a median follow-up of 24.9 months (interquartile range: 11.3-43.0 months), patients with POLE/D1pd showed a significantly superior progression-free survival (PFS) compared to dMMR/MSI-H mCRC [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.24, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.08-0.74, P = 0.01] and superior overall survival (OS) (HR = 0.38, 95% CI 0.12-1.18, P = 0.09). In multivariable analyses including the type of DNA repair defect, POLE/D1pd was associated with significantly improved PFS (HR = 0.17, 95% CI 0.04-0.69, P = 0.013) and OS (HR = 0.24, 95% CI 0.06-0.98, P = 0.047). Molecular profiling showed that POLE/D1pd tumors have higher tumor mutational burden (TMB). Responses were observed in both subtypes and were associated with the intensity of POLE/D1pd signature. Patients with POLE/D1pd mCRC showed more favorable outcomes compared to dMMR/MSI-H mCRC to treatment with ICIs in terms of tumor response and survival.",

We report 5-year outcomes from the phase II NeoCombi trial. NeoCombi (NCT01972347) was a single-arm, open-label, single-centre, phase II trial. Eligible patients were adults (aged ≥18 years) with histologically confirmed, resectable, RECIST-measurable, American Joint Committee on Cancer seventh edition clinical stage IIIB-C BRAF V600E/K-mutant melanoma and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status ≤1. Patients received 52 weeks of treatment with dabrafenib 150 mg (orally twice per day) plus trametinib 2 mg (orally once per day), with complete resection of the pre-therapy tumour bed at week 12. Between 20 August 2014 and 19 April 2017, 35 patients were enrolled. At data cut-off (17 August 2021), the median follow-up was 60 months [95% confidence interval (CI) 56-72 months]. Overall, 21 of 35 (60%) patients recurred, including 12 (57%) with first recurrence in locoregional sites (followed by later distant recurrence in 6) and 9 (43%) with first recurrence in distant sites, including 3 in the brain. Most recurrences occurred within 2 years, with no recurrences beyond 3 years. At 5 years, recurrence-free survival (RFS) was 40% (95% CI 27% to 60%), distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) was 57% (95% CI 42% to 76%), and overall survival was 80% (95% CI 67% to 94%). Five-year survival outcomes were stratified by pathological response: RFS was 53% with pathological complete response (pCR) versus 28% with non-pCR (P = 0.087), DMFS was 59% versus 55% (P = 0.647), and overall survival was 88% versus 71% (P = 0.205), respectively. Neoadjuvant dabrafenib plus trametinib has high pathological response rates in clinical stage III melanoma, but low rates of RFS, similar to those achieved with adjuvant targeted therapy alone.

To assess efficacy and safety of a tailored approach using nivolumab + ipilimumab as an immunotherapeutic boost for mUC. In this phase 2 nonrandomized trial, patients with mUC composed 2 cohorts. Cohort 1 received first-line or second-/third-line nivolumab with escalating doses of ipilimumab, and cohort 2 received second-/third-line nivolumab with high-dose ipilimumab. Recruitment spanned 26 sites in Germany and Austria from August 8, 2017, to February 18, 2021. All patients had a 70% or higher Karnofsky Performance Score and measurable disease per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours, version 1.1. All patients initiated 4 doses of 240-mg nivolumab (1× every 2 wk). Week 8 nonresponders received nivolumab + ipilimumab (1× every 3 wk). Cohort 1 received 2 doses of 3-mg/kg nivolumab + 1-mg/kg ipilimumab followed by 2 doses of 1-mg/kg nivolumab + 3-mg/kg ipilimumab if no response. Due to safety concerns, cohort 1 treatment was halted, and first-line cohort 2 treatment was not pursued. Cohort 2 received 2 to 4 doses of 1-mg/kg nivolumab + 3-mg/kg ipilimumab. Responders continued with nivolumab maintenance but could receive nivolumab + ipilimumab for later progression. The primary end point was objective response rate. The study comprised 169 patients (118 [69.8%] men; median [range] age, 68 [37-84] years): 86 in cohort 1 (42 first-line; 44 second-/third-line) and 83 in cohort 2. The median (IQR) follow-up times were 10.4 (4.2-23.5) months (first-line cohort 1), 7.5 (3.1-23.8) months (second-/third-line cohort 1), and 6.2 (3.2-22.7) months (cohort 2). Response rates to nivolumab induction were 12/42 (29%, first-line cohort 1), 10/44 (23%, second-/third-line cohort 1), and 17/83 (20%, cohort 2). Response rates to a tailored approach were 20/42 (48% [90% CI, 34%-61%], first-line cohort 1), 12/44 (27% [90% CI, 17%-40%], second-/third-line cohort 1), and 27/83 (33% [90% CI, 23%-42%], cohort 2). Three-year overall survival rates for first-line cohort 1, second-/third-line cohort 1, and cohort 2 using the Kaplan-Meier method were 32% (95% CI, 17%-49%), 19% (95% CI, 8%-33%), and 34% (95% CI, 23%-44%), respectively. In this nonrandomized trial, although first-line cohort 1 treatment improved objective response rates, considerable progression events urge caution with this as a first-line therapy. Second-/third-line cohort 1 treatment did not improve response rates compared with nivolumab monotherapy. However, added high-dose ipilimumab may improve tumor response and survival in patients with mUC. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03219775.",

In this paper, we present patient-reported outcomes from TOPAZ-1. In TOPAZ-1 (NCT03875235), participants aged 18 years or older with previously untreated, unresectable, locally advanced, or metastatic biliary tract cancer with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1 and one or more measurable lesions per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST; version 1.1) were randomly assigned (1:1) to the durvalumab group or the placebo group using a computer-generated randomisation scheme. Participants received 1500 mg durvalumab or matched placebo intravenously every 3 weeks (on day 1 of the cycle) for up to eight cycles in combination with 1000 mg/m Between April 16, 2019, and Dec 11, 2020, 685 participants were enrolled and randomly assigned, 341 to the durvalumab group and 344 to the placebo group. Overall, 345 (50%) of participants were male and 340 (50%) were female. Data for the QLQ-C30 were available for 318 participants in the durvalumab group and 328 in the placebo group (median follow-up 9·9 months [IQR 6·7 to 14·1]). Data for the QLQ-BIL21 were available for 305 participants in the durvalumab group and 322 in the placebo group (median follow-up 10·2 months [IQR 6·7 to 14·3]). The proportions of participants in both groups who completed questionnaires were high and baseline scores were mostly similar across treatment groups. For global health status or quality of life, functioning, and symptoms, we noted no difference in time to deterioration or adjusted mean changes from baseline were observed between groups. Median time to deterioration of global health status or quality of life was 7·4 months (95% CI 5·6 to 8·9) in the durvalumab group and 6·7 months (5·6 to 7·9) in the placebo group (hazard ratio 0·87 [95% CI 0·69 to 1·12]). The adjusted mean change from baseline was 1·23 (95% CI -0·71 to 3·16) in the durvalumab group and 0·35 (-1·63 to 2·32) in the placebo group. The addition of durvalumab to gemcitabine and cisplatin did not have a detrimental effect on patient-reported outcomes. These results suggest that durvalumab, gemcitabine, and cisplatin is a tolerable treatment regimen in patients with advanced biliary tract cancer. AstraZeneca.",

An evidence-based analysis of the effectiveness of second-line immunosuppressive agents with regard to irAE and tumor control is lacking. The international web-based Side Effect Registry Immuno-Oncology (SERIO; http://serio-registry.org) is a collaborative initiative with the Paul-Ehrlich-Institute to document rare, severe, complex or therapy-refractory immunotherapy-induced side effects. The registry was queried on August 1, 2023 for cases of irAEs which were treated with second-line therapies. From a total of 1330 cases, 217 patients (16.3%) received 249 second-line therapies. A total of 19 different second-line therapies were employed, including TNF-alpha antagonists (46.5%), intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG; 19.1%), mycophenolate mofetil (15.9%), and methotrexate (3.6%). Therapy choices were determined by the type of irAE. The time to onset of sr-/sd-irAEs after ICI initiation did not consistently differ from steroid-responsive irAEs. While 74.3% of sr-/sd-irAEs resolved and 13.1% had improved, 4.3% persisted, 3.9% resulted in permanent sequelae, and 4.3% in death with ongoing symptoms. Infliximab exhibited potential for earlier symptom improvement compared to mycophenolate mofetil or IVIG. Tumor response in patients with second-line treated sd-/sr-irAE was similar to patients with irAEs treated with steroids only. Several second-line therapies are effective against sr-/sd-irAEs, the second-line therapies show no clear negative impact on tumor response, and infliximab shows potential for faster improvement of symptoms.

    "title": "FOLFIRI Plus Durvalumab With or Without Tremelimumab in Second-Line Treatment of Advanced Gastric or Gastroesophageal Junction Adenocarcinoma: The PRODIGE 59-FFCD 1707-DURIGAST Randomized Clinical Trial.",
    "abstract": "Efficacy of second-line chemotherapy in advanced gastric or gastrooesphageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma remains limited. To determine the efficacy of 1 or 2 immune checkpoint inhibitors combined with FOLFIRI (leucovorin [folinic acid], fluorouracil, and irinotecan) in the treatment of advanced gastric/GEJ adenocarcinoma. The PRODIGE 59-FFCD 1707-DURIGAST trial is a randomized, multicenter, noncomparative, phase 2 trial, conducted from August 27, 2020, and June 4, 2021, at 37 centers in France that included patients with advanced gastric/GEJ adenocarcinoma who had disease progression after platinum-based first-line chemotherapy. Patients were randomized to receive FOLFIRI plus durvalumab (anti-programmed cell death 1 [PD-L1]) (FD arm) or FOLFIRI plus durvalumab and tremelimumab (anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated protein 4 [CTLA-4]) (FDT arm). The efficacy analyses used a clinical cutoff date of January 9, 2023. The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS) at 4 months according to RECIST 1.1 criteria evaluated by investigators. Overall, between August 27, 2020, and June 4, 2021, 96 patients were randomized (48 in each arm). The median age was 59.7 years, 28 patients (30.4%) were women and 49 (53.3%) had GEJ tumors. Four month PFS was 44.7% (90% CI, 32.3-57.7) and 55.6% (90% CI, 42.3-68.3) in the FD and FDT arms, respectively. The primary end point was not met. Median PFS was 3.8 and 5.4 months, objective response rates were 34.7% and 37.7%, and median overall survival was 13.2 and 9.5 months in the FD and FDT arms, respectively. Disease control beyond 1 year was 14.9% in the FD arm and 24.4% in the FDT arm. Grade 3 to 4 treatment-related adverse events were observed in 22 (47.8%) patients in each arm. A combined positive score (CPS) PD-L1 of 5 or higher was observed in 18 tumors (34.0%) and a tumor proportion score (TPS) PD-L1 of 1% or higher in 13 tumors (24.5%). Median PFS according to CPS PD-L1 was similar (3.6 months for PD-L1 CPS ≥5 vs 5.4 months for PD-L1 CPS <5) by contrast for TPS PD-L1 (6.0 months for PD-L1 TPS ≥1% vs 3.8 months for PD-L1 TPS <1%). Combination of immune checkpoint inhibitors with FOLFIRI in second-line treatment for advanced gastric/GEJ adenocarcinoma showed an acceptable safety profile but antitumor activity only in a subgroup of patients.

    "title": "Gedatolisib in combination with palbociclib and endocrine therapy in women with hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer: results from the dose expansion groups of an open-label, phase 1b study.",
    "abstract": "The PI3K-mTOR pathway is frequently dysregulated in breast cancer. Combining an inhibitor targeting all class I PI3K isoforms and mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1)-mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2) with endocrine therapy and a CDK4/6 inhibitor might provide more effective tumour control than standard-of-care therapy. To evaluate this hypothesis, gedatolisib, a pan-PI3K-mTOR inhibitor, was assessed in a phase 1b trial combined with palbociclib and endocrine therapy in patients with hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative, advanced breast cancer. Results from the dose expansion portion of this trial are reported herein. This multicentre, open-label, phase 1b study recruited female patients aged at least 18 years from 17 sites across the USA with hormone-receptor-positive, HER2-negative, advanced breast cancer and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-1. Four patient groups were studied in the dose expansion portion of the study: treatment-naive in the advanced setting (first line; group A), progression on 1-2 lines of endocrine therapy but CDK4/6 inhibitor-naive (group B); and one or more previous lines (second-line and higher) of therapy, including a CDK4/6 inhibitor (groups C and D). Gedatolisib 180 mg was administered intravenously weekly in 28-day treatment cycles for groups A-C, and on days 1, 8, and 15 for group D. Letrozole (group A), fulvestrant (groups B-D), and palbociclib (all groups) were administered at standard doses and schedules. The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed objective response rate per RECIST version 1.1 in the evaluable analysis set. This trial is completed and registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02684032. Between Dec 19, 2017, and June 19, 2019, 103 female participants were enrolled in the dose expansion groups A (n=31), B (n=13), C (n=32), and D (n=27). Median follow-up was 16·6 months (IQR 5·7-48·4) for group A, 11·0 months (7·6-16·9) for group B, 3·6 months (1·8-7·5) for group C, and 9·4 months (5·3-16·7) for group D for the primary endpoint. Gedatolisib, palbociclib, and endocrine therapy induced an objective response in 23 (85·2%; 90% CI 69·2-94·8) of 27 evaluable first-line participants (group A). In the second-line and higher setting, an objective response was observed in eight (61·5%; 90% CI 35·5-83·4) of 13 evaluable group B participants, seven (25·0%; 12·4-41·9) of 28 evaluable group C participants, and 15 (55·6%; 38·2-72·0) of 27 evaluable group D participants; this included participants with both wild-type and mutated PIK3CA tumours. The most common grade 3-4 treatment-related adverse events were neutropenia (65 [63%] of 103), stomatitis (28 [27%]), and rash (21 [20%]). Grade 3-4 hyperglycaemia was reported in six (6%) participants. 23 (22%) of 103 participants had a treatment-related serious adverse event, and there were no treatment-related deaths. Nine (9%) participants discontinued treatment because of a treatment-emergent adverse event. Gedatolisib plus palbociclib and endocrine therapy showed a promising objective response rate compared with the published results for standard-of-care therapies and had an acceptable safety profile.

    "abstract": "TILT-123 (igrelimogene litadenorepvec) is an oncolytic adenovirus armed with TNFa and IL2, designed to induce T-cell infiltration and cytotoxicity in solid tumors. TUNIMO (NCT04695327) was a single-arm, multicenter phase I dose-escalation trial designed to assess the safety of TILT-123 in advanced solid cancers refractory to standard therapy. Patients received intravenous and intratumoral TILT-123. The primary endpoint was safety by adverse events (AE), laboratory values, vital signs, and electrocardiograms. Secondary endpoints included tumor response, pharmacokinetics, and predictive biomarkers. Twenty patients were enrolled, with a median age of 58 years. Most prevalent cancer types included sarcomas (35%), melanomas (15%) and ovarian cancers (15%). No dose-limiting toxicities were observed. The most frequent treatment-related AEs included fever (16.7%), chills (13.0%), and fatigue (9.3%). Ten patients were evaluable for response on day 78 with RECIST 1.1, iRECIST or PET-based evaluation. The disease control rate by PET was 6/10 (60% of evaluable patients) and 2/10 by RECIST 1.1 and iRECIST(20%of evaluable patients). Tumor size reductions occurred in both injected and non-injected lesions. TILT-123 was detected in injected and non-injected tumors, and virus was observed in blood after intravenous and intratumoral injections. Treatment resulted in reduction of lymphocytes in blood, with concurrent lymphocyte increases in tumors, findings compatible with trafficking. TILT-123 was safe and able to produce antitumor effects in local and distant lesions in heavily pre-treated patients. Good tolerability of TILT-123 facilitates combination studies, several of which are ongoing (NCT04217473, NCT05271318, NCT05222932, and NCT06125197).

    "title": "Response of bilateral Wilms tumor to chemotherapy suggests histologic subtype and guides treatment.",
    "abstract": "Patients with bilateral Wilms tumor initially receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy to shrink the tumors and increase the likelihood of successful nephron-sparing surgery. Biopsy of poorly responding tumors is often done to better understand therapy resistance. The purpose of this retrospective, single-institution study was to determine whether initial chemotherapy response is associated with tumor histology, potentially obviating the need for biopsy or change in chemotherapy. Patients with synchronous bilateral Wilms tumors who underwent surgery at St Jude Children's Research Hospital from January 2000 to March 2022 were considered for this study. A mixed-effects logistic regression model was used to evaluate the likelihood of the tumor being stromal predominant, as predicted by tumor response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. A total of 68 patients were eligible for this study. Tumors that increased in size had an odds ratio of 19.5 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.46 to 155.03) for being stromal predominant vs any other histologic subtype. Age at diagnosis was youngest in patients with stromal-predominant tumors, with a mean age of 18.8 (14.1) months compared with all other histologic subtypes (χ2 = 7.05, P = .07). The predictive value of a tumor growing combined with patient aged younger than 18 months for confirming stromal-predominant histology was 85.7% (95% CI = 57.18% to 93.5%). Tumors that increased in size during neoadjuvant chemotherapy were most frequently stromal-predominant bilateral Wilms tumor, especially in younger patients. Therefore, nephron-sparing surgery, rather than biopsy, or extension or intensification of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, should be considered for bilateral Wilms tumors that increase in volume during neoadjuvant chemotherapy, particularly in patients aged younger than 18 months.",

The preliminary efficacy and safety of oral ModraDoc006/r was evaluated in a global randomized phase II trial and compared to the current standard chemotherapy regimen of intravenous (i.v.) docetaxel and prednisone. 103 mCRPC patients, chemotherapy-naïve with/without abiraterone and/or enzalutamide pretreated, with adequate organ function and evaluable disease per RECIST v1.1 and PCWG3 guidelines were randomized 1:1 into two cohorts. In Cohort 1, 49 patients received docetaxel 75 mg/m There was no significant difference in rPFS between the 2 arms (p = 0.1465). Median rPFS was 9.5 months and 11.1 months (95% CI) for ModraDoc006/r and i.v. docetaxel, respectively. Partial response was noted in 44.1% and 38.7% measurable disease patients, and 50% decline of PSA was seen in 23 (50%) and 26 (56.5%) evaluable cases treated with ModraDoc006/r and i.v. docetaxel, respectively. The safety profile of ModraDoc006/r 20-20/200-100 mg dose was significantly better than i.v. docetaxel, with mild (mostly Grade 1) gastrointestinal toxicities, no hematologic adverse events, and neuropathy and alopecia incidence of 11.5% and 25%, respectively. ModraDoc006/r potentially represents a widely applicable, convenient, effective, and better tolerated oral taxane therapy option for mCRPC. Further investigation of ModraDoc006/r in a large randomized trial is warranted.",

We conducted a multicenter, single-arm, phase II, pivotal registrational study that evaluated the efficacy and safety of the MEK inhibitor tunlametinib in patients with unresectable, stage III/IV, NRAS-mutant melanoma (NCT05217303). The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR) assessed by independent radiological review committee (IRRC) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1. The secondary endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS), disease control rate (DCR), duration of response(DOR), overall survival (OS) and safety. Between November 2, 2020 and February 11, 2022, a total of 100 patients were enrolled. All (n = 100) patients received at least one dose of tunlametinib (safety analysis set [SAS]) and 95 had central laboratory-confirmed NRAS mutations (full analysis set [FAS]). In the FAS, NRAS mutations were observed at Q61 (78.9%), G12 (15.8%) and G13 (5.3%). The IRRC-assessed ORR was 35.8%, with a median DOR of 6.1 months. The median PFS was 4.2 months, DCR was 72.6% and median OS was 13.7 months. Subgroup analysis showed that in patients who had previously received immunotherapy, the ORR was 40.6%. No treatment-related deaths occurred. Tunlametinib showed promising antitumor activity with a manageable safety profile in patients with advanced NRAS-mutant melanoma, including those who had prior exposure to immunotherapy.

Propranolol, a non-selective β-blocker, was able to initiate apoptosis in angiosarcoma cell lines and its anti-tumor activity has been described in several case reports. The aim of this trial was to prospectively evaluate the anti-tumor activity of propranolol monotherapy in patients with angiosarcoma before proceeding to standard of care treatment. Propranolol was dosed 80 mg to 240 mg/day for 3 to 6 weeks according to a dose titration schedule. The primary endpoint was clinical response (response according to RECIST 1.1 or stable disease with improvement of cutaneous lesions) in at least three patients. Exploratory objectives included histologic response (>30% decrease in Ki-67), FDG PET response, and β-receptor expression levels. Fourteen patients were enrolled. The median duration of treatment was 26 days (range 21-42 days). The median highest propranolol dose was 160 mg/day (range 80 - 240 mg). Two patients showed clinical response (14%, 95% CI 3-100%). One of these patients showed a partial metabolic response on PET-CT. None of the tumors showed histologic response. The most common adverse event was grade 1/2 bradycardia (86%). There were no grade ≥ 3 adverse events. ADRB2 was overexpressed in 16 out of 18 tumors, in both responders and non-responders. None of the tumors showed ADRB1 overexpression. This window-of-opportunity trial did not show clinical efficacy of propranolol monotherapy. However, two out of 14 patients did show clinical benefit.

This first-in-human study (NCT04170153) evaluated safety, tolerability, maximum tolerated dose (MTD), recommended dose for expansion (RDE), pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and preliminary efficacy of tuvusertib monotherapy. Ascending tuvusertib doses were evaluated in 55 patients with metastatic or locally advanced unresectable solid tumors. A safety monitoring committee determined dose escalation based on PK, PD, and safety data guided by a Bayesian 2-parameter logistic regression model. Molecular responses (MR) were assessed in circulating tumor DNA samples. Most common grade ≥3 treatment-emergent adverse events were anemia (36%), neutropenia, and lymphopenia (both 7%). Eleven patients experienced dose-limiting toxicities, most commonly grade 2 (n = 2) or 3 (n = 8) anemia. No persistent effects on blood immune cell populations were observed. The RDE was 180 mg tuvusertib QD (once daily), 2 weeks on/1 week off treatment, which was better tolerated than the MTD (180 mg QD continuously). Tuvusertib median time to peak plasma concentration ranged from 0.5 to 3.5 hours and mean elimination half-life from 1.2 to 5.6 hours. Exposure-related PD analysis suggested maximum target engagement at ≥130 mg tuvusertib QD. Tuvusertib induced frequent MRs in the predicted efficacious dose range; MRs were enriched in patients with radiological disease stabilization, and complete MRs were detected for mutations in ARID1A, ATRX, and DAXX. One patient with platinum- and PARP inhibitor-resistant BRCA wild-type ovarian cancer achieved an unconfirmed RECIST v1.1 partial response. Tuvusertib demonstrated manageable safety and exposure-related target engagement. Further clinical evaluation of tuvusertib is ongoing.",

U31402-A-U102 is an ongoing phase I study of HER3-DXd in patients with advanced NSCLC. Patients with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mutated NSCLC that progressed after EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) and platinum-based chemotherapy (PBC) who received HER3-DXd 5.6 mg/kg intravenously once every 3 weeks had a confirmed objective response rate (cORR) of 39%. We present median overall survival (OS) with extended follow-up in a larger population of patients with EGFR-mutated NSCLC and an exploratory analysis in those with acquired genomic alterations potentially associated with resistance to HER3-DXd. Safety was assessed in patients with EGFR-mutated NSCLC previously treated with EGFR TKI who received HER3-DXd 5.6 mg/kg; efficacy was assessed in those who also had prior PBC. In the safety population (N = 102), median treatment duration was 5.5 (range 0.7-27.5) months. Grade ≥3 adverse events occurred in 76.5% of patients; the overall safety profile was consistent with previous reports. In 78/102 patients who had prior third-generation EGFR TKI and PBC, cORR by blinded independent central review (as per RECIST v1.1) was 41.0% [95% confidence interval (CI) 30.0% to 52.7%], median progression-free survival was 6.4 (95% CI 4.4-10.8) months, and median OS was 16.2 (95% CI 11.2-21.9) months. Patients had diverse mechanisms of EGFR TKI resistance at baseline. At tumor progression, acquired mutations in ERBB3 and TOP1 that might confer resistance to HER3-DXd were identified. In patients with EGFR-mutated NSCLC after EGFR TKI and PBC, HER3-DXd treatment was associated with a clinically meaningful OS. The tumor biomarker characterization comprised the first description of potential mechanisms of resistance to HER3-DXd therapy.",

To account for immortal time bias, data from patients with antibiotics during ICB were analyzed separately in the time periods before and after start of antibiotics. Among 578 patients with first-line anti-PD1 based ICB, 7% of patients received antibiotics within 60 days prior to ICB and 19% after starting ICB. Antibiotic exposure prior to ICB was associated with worse PFS (adjusted HR 1.75 [95% CI 1.22-2.52]) and OS (adjusted HR 1.64 [95% CI 1.04-2.58]) by multivariate analysis adjusting for potential confounders. The use of antibiotics after the start of ICB had no effect on either PFS (adjusted HR 1.19; 95% CI 0.89-1.60) or OS (adjusted HR 1.08; 95% CI 0.75-1.57). Antibiotic exposure within 60 days prior to ICB seems to be associated with worse PFS and OS in melanoma patients receiving first-line anti-PD1 based therapy, whereas antibiotics after the start of ICB do not appear to affect PFS or OS.",

    "abstract": "E7389-LF is a liposomal formulation of the microtubule dynamics inhibitor eribulin and has shown preliminary efficacy in the treatment of gastric cancer. Study 120, a phase Ib/II open-label study, assessed efficacy and safety of E7389-LF in combination with nivolumab, a programmed cell death (PD)-1 inhibitor. This report focuses on the gastric cancer cohort within the expansion phase. Eligible patients had unresectable, measurable gastric cancer, progression following a platinum drug plus fluoropyrimidine (1L), and a taxane-containing regimen (2L). The primary objective of the expansion phase was objective response rate, secondary objectives included safety and PFS, and exploratory objectives included overall survival and biomarker evaluation. Patients received E7389-LF 2.1 mg/m2 in combination with nivolumab 360 mg every 3 weeks, both as intravenous infusions. Tumor responses were assessed every 6 weeks by the investigators per RECIST v1.1. Plasma and tumor biomarkers were assessed. In the 31 patients who received E7389-LF in combination with nivolumab, the objective response rate was 25.8% [confidence interval (CI), 11.9-44.6]. The median progression-free survival was 2.69 months (95% CI, 1.91-2.99) and median overall survival was 7.85 months (95% CI, 4.47-not estimable). The most common treatment-related TEAE of any grade were neutropenia (77.4%), leukopenia (74.2%), and decreased appetite (51.6%). E7389-LF in combination with nivolumab significantly increased CD8-positive cells at C2D1 (P = 0.039), and six of seven vascular markers and four IFNγ-related markers showed increases from C1D1. Promising antitumor activity was observed with E7389-LF in combination with nivolumab in patients with gastric cancer, and no new safety signals were observed, compared with either monotherapy.",

    "abstract": "Cancer-related mortality rates among kidney transplant recipients (KTR) are high, but these patients have largely been excluded from trials of immune checkpoint inhibitors because of immunosuppression and risk of treatment-related allograft loss (TRAL). We conducted a prospective clinical trial testing nivolumab (NIVO) + tacrolimus (TACRO) + prednisone (PRED) ± ipilimumab (IPI) in KTR with advanced cutaneous cancers. Adult KTR with advanced melanoma or basal, cutaneous squamous, or Merkel cell carcinomas were eligible. Immunosuppression was standardized to TACRO (serum trough 2-5 ng/mL) + PRED 5 mg once daily. Patients then received NIVO 480 mg IV once every 4 weeks. The primary composite end point was partial or complete (tumor) response (CR) or stable disease per RECIST v1.1 without allograft loss at 16W. Patients with progressive disease (PD) could receive IPI 1 mg/kg IV + NIVO 3 mg/kg once every 3 weeks × 4 followed by NIVO. Donor-derived cell-free DNA (dd-cfDNA) levels were measured approximately once every 2 weeks as a potential predictor of allograft rejection. Among eight evaluable patients, none met the trial's primary end point. All eight patients experienced PD on NIVO + TACRO + PRED; TRAL occurred in one patient. Six patients then received IPI + NIVO + TACRO + PRED. Best overall responses: two CR (one with TRAL) and four PD (one with TRAL). In total, 7 of 8 pre-NIVO tumor biopsies contained a paucity of infiltrating immune cells. In total, 2 of 5 on-NIVO biopsies demonstrated moderate immune infiltrates; both patients later experienced a CR to IPI + NIVO. In 2 of 3 patients with TRAL, dd-cfDNA elevations occurred 10 and 15 days before increases in serum creatinine. In most KTR with advanced skin cancer, TACRO + PRED provides insufficient allograft protection and compromises immune-mediated tumor regression after administration of NIVO ± IPI. Elevated dd-cfDNA levels can signal treatment-related allograft rejection earlier than rises in serum creatinine.",

    "abstract": "RECIST criteria for progressive disease, partial response, and complete response, reflecting +20%, -30%, and -100% tumor size changes, respectively, are critical outcome variables in oncology clinical trials. Herein, we evaluated post-immunotherapy tumor size change correlation with outcomes. We used a unique clinical trial data resource, a multicenter basket trial in patients with rare solid tumors treated with nivolumab (anti-PD-1) and ipilimumab (anti-CTLA-4) between 2017 and 2023 (National Cancer Institute/Southwest Oncology Group-sponsored DART trial [NCT02834013]) (open at 1083 sites at its peak). Outcome associations were evaluated by survival analysis techniques including Martingale residuals. In 638 evaluable patients, we found strong linear relationships between percent change in tumor measurement up to a 40%-50% increase and progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS) (both Cox regression P < .001; landmark analyses based on day 65). Pearson R correlation between survival estimates and tumor change category were -0.94, -0.89, and -0.89 (PFS) and -0.84, -0.90, and -0.90 (OS) for median, 6-month (PFS), and 1-year (OS) and for 1-year (PFS) and 2-year (OS) estimates. Percent change in tumor measurement per RECISTv1.1 (the sum of longest dimensions of target lesions) has a linear association with PFS and OS up to a 40% to 50% increase in tumor measurement in this cohort of patients with rare cancers who received combination immune checkpoint blockade. Quantitative first scan tumor measurement changes include important information to evaluate the potential efficacy of a therapy beyond the proportion of patients who achieve an objective response.",

    "abstract": "KRASG12C inhibitors, like sotorasib and adagrasib, potently and selectively inhibit KRASG12C through a covalent interaction with the mutant cysteine, driving clinical efficacy in KRASG12C tumors. Because amino acid sequences of the three main RAS isoforms-KRAS, NRAS, and HRAS-are highly similar, we hypothesized that some KRASG12C inhibitors might also target NRASG12C and/or HRASG12C, which are less common but critical oncogenic driver mutations in some tumors. Although some inhibitors, like adagrasib, were highly selective for KRASG12C, others also potently inhibited NRASG12C and/or HRASG12C. Notably, sotorasib was five-fold more potent against NRASG12C compared with KRASG12C or HRASG12C. Structural and reciprocal mutagenesis studies suggested that differences in isoform-specific binding are mediated by a single amino acid: Histidine-95 in KRAS (Leucine-95 in NRAS). A patient with NRASG12C colorectal cancer treated with sotorasib and the anti-EGFR antibody panitumumab achieved a marked tumor response, demonstrating that sotorasib can be clinically effective in NRASG12C-mutated tumors. These studies demonstrate that certain KRASG12C inhibitors effectively target all RASG12C mutations and that sotorasib specifically is a potent NRASG12C inhibitor capable of driving clinical responses. These findings have important implications for the treatment of patients with NRASG12C or HRASG12C cancers and could guide design of NRAS or HRAS inhibitors.

This non-randomized phase II trial evaluated the combination of eribulin and pembrolizumab in patients with soft-tissue sarcomas (STS). Patients enrolled in one of three cohorts: leiomyosarcoma (LMS), liposarcomas (LPS), or other STS that may benefit from PD-1 inhibitors, including undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (UPS). Eribulin was administered at 1.4 mg/m2 i.v. (days 1 and 8) with fixed-dose pembrolizumab 200 mg i.v.

Secondary endpoints included the objective response rate, median PFS, safety profile, and overall survival (OS). Pretreatment and on-treatment blood specimens were evaluated in patients who achieved durable disease control (DDC) or progression within 12 weeks [early progression (EP)]. Multiplexed immunofluorescence was performed on archival LPS samples from patients with DDC or EP. Fifty-seven patients enrolled (LMS, n = 19; LPS, n = 20; UPS/Other, n = 18). The PFS-12 was 36.8% (90% confidence interval: 22.5-60.4) for LMS, 69.6% (54.5-89.0) for LPS, and 52.6% (36.8-75.3) for UPS/Other cohorts. All 3 patients in the UPS/Other cohort with angiosarcoma achieved RECIST responses. Toxicity was manageable. Higher IFNα and IL4 serum levels were associated with clinical benefit. Immune aggregates expressing PD-1 and PD-L1 were observed in a patient that completed 2 years of treatment. The combination of eribulin and pembrolizumab demonstrated promising activity in LPS and angiosarcoma.",

    "abstract": "Cancer antigen-125 (CA-125) is recommended by treatment guidelines and widely used to diagnose ovarian cancer recurrence. The value of CA-125 as a surrogate for disease progression (PD) and its concordance with radiologic progression are unclear, particularly for women with platinum-sensitive relapsed ovarian cancer (PSROC) who have responded to chemotherapy and treated with maintenance poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor (PARPi). In this pooled analysis of four randomized trials of maintenance PARPi or placebo (Study 19, SOLO2, ARIEL3, and NOVA), we extracted data on CA-125 PD as defined by Gynecologic Cancer InterGroup criteria and RECIST v1.1. We evaluated the concordance between CA-125 and RECIST PD and reported on the negative predictive value (NPV) and positive predictive value (PPV). Of 1,262 participants (n = 818 PARPi, n = 444 placebo), 403 (32%) had CA-125 PD, and of these, 366 had concordant RECIST PD (PPV, 91% [95% CI, 88 to 93]). However, of 859 (68%) without CA-125 PD, 382 also did not have RECIST PD (NPV, 44% [95% CI, 41 to 48]). Within the treatment arms, PPV remained high (PARPi, 91% [95% CI, 86 to 94]; placebo, 91% [95% CI, 86 to 95]) but NPV was lower on placebo (PARPi, 53% [95% CI, 49 to 57]; placebo, 25% [95% CI, 20 to 31]). Of 477 with RECIST-only PD, most (95%) had a normal CA-125 at the start of maintenance therapy and the majority (n = 304, 64%) had CA-125 that remained within normal range. Solid organ recurrence without peritoneal disease was more common in those with RECIST-only PD than in those with CA-125 and RECIST PD (36%  In patients with PSROC treated with maintenance PARPi, almost half with RECIST PD did not have CA-125 PD, challenging current guidelines.

Nivolumab monotherapy demonstrated clinical benefit with an acceptable safety profile in patients with aHCC in the CheckMate 040 study. Five-year follow-up of the sorafenib-naive and sorafenib-experienced groups of CheckMate 040 is presented here. Patients received nivolumab monotherapy at dose levels of 0.1-10.0 mg/kg (dose-escalation phase) or 3 mg/kg (dose-expansion phase) every 2 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Primary endpoints were safety and tolerability (dose escalation), and objective response rate (ORR) by blinded independent central review (BICR) and by investigator as per RECIST version 1.1 (dose expansion). Eighty sorafenib-naive and 154 sorafenib-experienced patients were treated. Minimum follow-up in both groups was 60 months. ORR as per BICR was 20% [95% confidence interval (CI) 12% to 30%] and 14% (95% CI 9% to 21%) in the sorafenib-naive and sorafenib-experienced groups, respectively. Responses occurred regardless of HCC etiology or baseline tumor cell programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression levels. Median overall survival (OS) was 26.6 months (95% CI 16.6-30.6 months) and 15.1 months (95% CI 13.0-18.2 months) in sorafenib-naive and sorafenib-experienced patients, respectively. The 3-year OS rates were 28% in the sorafenib-naive and 20% in the sorafenib-experienced groups; 5-year OS rates were 14% and 12%, respectively. No new safety signals were identified; grade 3/4 treatment-related adverse events were observed in 33% and 21% of patients in the sorafenib-naive and sorafenib-experienced groups, respectively. Biomarker analyses showed that baseline PD-L1 expression ≥1% was associated with higher ORR and longer OS compared with PD-L1 <1%. In the sorafenib-naive group, patients with OS ≥3 years exhibited higher baseline CD8 T-cell density compared with those with OS <1 year. With 5 years of follow-up, nivolumab monotherapy continued to provide durable clinical benefit with manageable safety in sorafenib-naive and sorafenib-experienced patients with aHCC.",

However, these changes can only be detected when there are enough macroscopic changes in tumor volume, which limits the usability of radiological response criteria in evaluating earlier stages of disease response and necessitates much time to lapse for gross changes to be notable. One promising approach is to incorporate dynamic changes in circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), which occur early in the course of therapy and can predict tumor responses weeks before gross size changes manifest. However, several issues need to be addressed before recommending the implementation of ctDNA response criteria in daily clinical practice such as clinical, biological, and regulatory challenges and, most importantly, the need to standardize/harmonize detection methods and ways to define ctDNA response and/or progression for precision oncology. Herein, we review the use of liquid biopsy (LB) to evaluate response in solid tumors and propose a plan toward standardization of LB-RECIST.",

    "abstract": "In randomized clinical trials (RCTs), blinded independent central review (BICR) is used to minimize heterogeneity and bias associated with radiological response evaluation by local investigators. However, BICR adds costs and complexity to the trial management. We assessed the discrepancy index between progression-free survival (PFS) assessment by local investigators and by BICR in RCTs conducted in patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC). A systematic search of PubMed, Embase, Cochrane databases and conference proceedings (ASCO, SABCS, ESMO) was performed up to January 4, 2023 (PROSPERO: CRD42021229865). All RCTs published from 2000 to 2022, including MBC patients treated in first- or second-line, and reporting PFS assessed by local investigators and BICR were included. A discrepancy index between BICR-assessed and investigator-assessed HR was calculated for each trial and an overall combined DI was obtained using a fixed-effects model. The agreement between hazard ratios (HR) of PFS assessed by local investigators and BICR was measured using intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). We analyzed 24 studies including 13,168 patients. Among them, 19 (79%) were in first-line, 18 (75%) were phase III trials and 23 (96%) had PFS as primary endpoint. The overall combined discrepancy index was 0.97 (95%CI 0.85-1.10; ICC 0.831, p < 0.001) suggesting no statistically significant difference in PFS assessment between local investigators and BICR. This result was consistent across all analyzed subgroups. The good concordance between local investigator and BICR assessments supports the reliability of local investigator-assessed PFS as primary endpoint for RCTs in MBC and questions the practical utility of implementing BICR in all RCTs.",

We conducted an investigator-initiated clinical trial evaluating neoadjuvant (NA) SG (NCT04230109), and report primary results. Participants with early-stage TNBC received NA SG for four cycles. The primary objective was to assess pathological complete response (pCR) rate in breast and lymph nodes (ypT0/isN0) to SG. Secondary objectives included overall response rate (ORR), safety, event-free survival (EFS), and predictive biomarkers. A response-guided approach was utilized, and subsequent systemic therapy decisions were at the discretion of the treating physician. From July 2020 to August 2021, 50 participants were enrolled (median age = 48.5 years; 13 clinical stage I disease, 26 stage II, 11 stage III). Forty-nine (98%) completed four cycles of SG. Overall, the pCR rate with SG alone was 30% [n = 15, 95% confidence interval (CI) 18% to 45%]. The ORR per RECIST V1.1 after SG alone was 64% (n = 32/50, 95% CI 77% to 98%). Higher Ki-67 and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) were predictive of pCR to SG (P = 0.007 for Ki-67 and 0.002 for TILs), while baseline TROP2 expression was not (P = 0.440). Common adverse events were nausea (82%), fatigue (76%), alopecia (76%), neutropenia (44%), and rash (48%). With a median follow-up time of 18.9 months (95% CI 16.3-21.9 months), the 2-year EFS for all participants was 95%. Among participants with a pCR with SG (n = 15), the 2-year EFS was 100%. In the first NA trial with an ADC in localized TNBC, SG demonstrated single-agent efficacy and feasibility of response-guided escalation/de-escalation. Further research on optimal duration of SG as well as NA combination strategies, including immunotherapy, are needed.",

We evaluated the therapeutic activity and safety of high-dose pemetrexed in progressive chordoma. Adult patients with previously treated, progressive chordoma participated in an open-label, single-institution, single-arm, pilot clinical trial of intravenous pemetrexed 900 mg/m2 every 3 weeks and supportive medications of folic acid, vitamin B12, and dexamethasone. The primary endpoint was objective response rate according to RECIST v1.1. Secondary endpoints included adverse events, progression-free survival (PFS), tumor molecular profiles, and alterations in tissue and blood-based biomarkers. Fifteen patients were enrolled and the median number of doses administered was 15 (range, 4-31). One patient discontinued treatment due to psychosocial issues after four cycles and one contracted COVID-19 after 13 cycles. Of the 14 response-evaluable patients, 2 (14%) achieved a partial response and 10 (71%) demonstrated stable disease.

    "abstract": "The efficacy of the selective KIT/PDGFRA inhibitor avapritinib (300 mg once daily) was explored in patients with non-PDGFRA-mutant gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) from the phase I NAVIGATOR and phase I/II CS3007-001 trials. Adults with unresectable/metastatic, KIT-only-mutant GISTs and progression following ≥1 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) were included in this post hoc analysis. Baseline mutational status was identified in tumor and plasma. Primary endpoints were objective response rate (ORR) and progression-free survival (PFS) by blinded independent radiology review per modified RECIST v1.1 in patients harboring KIT activation-loop mutations (KIT exons 17 or 18) without ATP binding-pocket mutations (KIT exons 13 or 14; ALposABPneg), and other KIT mutations (OTHERS). Sixty KIT ALposABPneg and 100 KIT OTHERS predominantly heavily pretreated patients (61.3% with ≥3 prior TKIs) were included. ORR was significantly higher in KIT ALposABPneg than KIT OTHERS patients (unadjusted: 26.7% vs. 12.0%; P = 0.0852; adjusted: 31.4% vs. 12.1%; P = 0.0047). Median PFS (mPFS) was significantly longer in KIT ALposABPneg patients compared with KIT OTHERS patients (unadjusted: 9.1 vs. 3.5 months; P = 0.0002; adjusted: 9.1 vs. 3.4 months; P < 0.0001), and longer in second- versus later-line settings (19.3 vs. 5.6-10.6 months). Benefit with avapritinib was observed in patients with KIT exon 9 mutations in the ≥4 line settings (mPFS: 5.6 and 3.7 months for 4 line and >4 line, respectively). Avapritinib showed greater antitumor activity in patients with GISTs harboring KIT ALposABPneg mutations versus KIT OTHERS, and may be considered in the former subpopulation. Patients with KIT exon 9 mutations may also benefit in ≥4 line settings.",

In the phase I LITESPARK-001 study, the first-in-class HIF-2α inhibitor belzutifan demonstrated antitumor activity and an acceptable safety profile for pretreated patients with advanced ccRCC. Updated data with additional follow-up of > 40 months are presented. LITESPARK-001 is an ongoing open-label study with a 3 + 3 dose-escalation design followed by an expansion phase. Patients with ccRCC enrolled at 7 sites received belzutifan 120 mg orally once daily until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or patient withdrawal. The data cutoff date was July 15, 2021. The primary end point was identifying the maximum tolerated dose and/or the recommended phase II dose. Secondary end points included objective response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DOR) per RECIST v1.1 by investigator assessment and safety. Median follow-up was 41.2 months (range, 38.2-47.7). Patients received a median of 3 (range, 1-9) prior systemic therapies. Of 55 patients, 14 (25 %) achieved an objective response. Median DOR was not reached (range, 3.1 + to 38.0 + months).

For biomarker-selected patients with LA-NSCLC, we hypothesized that sequential pembrolizumab and risk-adapted radiotherapy, without chemotherapy, would be well-tolerated and effective. Patients with stage III NSCLC or unresectable stage II NSCLC and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-1 were eligible for this trial. Patients with a PD-L1 tumor proportion score (TPS) of ≥50% received three cycles of induction pembrolizumab (200 mg, once every 21 days), followed by a 20-fraction course of risk-adapted thoracic radiotherapy (55 Gy delivered to tumors or lymph nodes with metabolic volume exceeding 20 cc, 48 Gy delivered to smaller lesions), followed by consolidation pembrolizumab to complete a 1-year treatment course. The primary study end point was 1-year progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary end points included response rates after induction pembrolizumab, overall survival (OS), and adverse events. Twenty-five patients with a PD-L1 TPS of ≥50% were enrolled. The median age was 71, most patients (88%) had stage IIIA or IIIB disease, and the median PD-L1 TPS was 75%. Two patients developed disease progression during induction pembrolizumab, and two patients discontinued pembrolizumab after one infusion because of immune-related adverse events. Using RECIST criteria, 12 patients (48%) exhibited a partial or complete response after induction pembrolizumab. Twenty-four patients (96%) received definitive thoracic radiotherapy. The 1-year PFS rate is 76%, satisfying our efficacy objective. One- and 2-year OS rates are 92% and 76%, respectively. The most common grade 3 adverse events were colitis (n = 2, 8%) and esophagitis (n = 2, 8%), and no higher-grade treatment-related adverse events have occurred. Pembrolizumab and risk-adapted radiotherapy, without chemotherapy, are a promising treatment approach for patients with LA-NSCLC with a PD-L1 TPS of ≥50%.",

    "abstract": "B-cell lymphoma-extra-large (BCL-xL) regulates apoptosis and is an attractive anticancer therapeutic target. However, BCL-xL inhibition also kills mature platelets, hampering clinical development. Using an innovative prodrug strategy, we have developed pelcitoclax (APG-1252), a potent, dual BCL-2 and BCL-xL inhibitor. Aims of this study were to characterize the antitumor activity and safety of pelcitoclax and explore its underlying mechanisms of action (MOA). Cell line-derived xenograft and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models were tested to evaluate antitumor activity and elucidate MOA. Subjects (N = 50) with metastatic small-cell lung cancer and other solid tumors received intravenous pelcitoclax once or twice weekly. Primary outcome measures were safety and tolerability; preliminary efficacy (responses every 2 cycles per RECIST version 1.1) represented a secondary endpoint. Pelcitoclax exhibited strong BAX/BAK‒dependent and caspase-mediated antiproliferative and apoptogenic activity in various cancer cell lines. Consistent with cell-based apoptogenic activity, pelcitoclax disrupted BCL-xL:BIM and BCL-xL:PUMA complexes in lung and gastric cancer PDX models. Levels of BCL-xL complexes correlated with tumor growth inhibition by pelcitoclax. Combined with taxanes, pelcitoclax enhanced antitumor activity by downregulating antiapoptotic protein myeloid cell leukemia-1 (MCL-1). Importantly, pelcitoclax was well tolerated and demonstrated preliminary therapeutic efficacy, with overall response and disease control rates of 6.5% and 30.4%, respectively. Most common treatment-related adverse events included transaminase elevations and reduced platelets that were less frequent with a once-weekly schedule. Our data demonstrate that pelcitoclax has antitumor activity and is well tolerated, supporting its further clinical development for human solid tumors, particularly combined with agents that downregulate MCL-1.",

Standard treatment involves radical bone resection and immediate reconstruction, causing functional, aesthetic, and psychological impairments. The BRAF V600E mutation is present in approximately 80% of mandible ameloblastomas, and BRAF inhibitors have demonstrated sustained responses in unresectable cases. We identified ameloblastoma patients planned for ablative surgery and screened them for BRAF V600E mutation. Neoadjuvant BRAF inhibitors were offered to facilitate jaw preservation surgery. Retrospective data collection encompassed treatment regimens, tolerability, tumor response, and conversion to mandible preservation surgery. Between 2017 and 2022, a total of 11 patients received dabrafenib (n = 6) or dabrafenib with trametinib (n = 5). The median age was 19 (range = 10-83) years. Median treatment duration was 10 (range = 3-20) months. All (100%) patients achieved a radiological response. Ten (91%) patients successfully converted to mandible preservation surgery with residual tumor enucleation. One patient attained complete radiological response, and surgery was not performed. Among the 10 surgically treated patients, all exhibited a pathological response, with 4 achieving near complete response and 6 partial response. At a median follow-up of 14 (range = 7-37) months after surgery, 1 case of recurrence was observed. Grade 1-2 adverse effects were reported in 8 (73%) patients, with a single case of grade 3 (hepatitis). Dose modification was necessary for 3 patients, and 4 experienced treatment interruptions, while 1 patient permanently discontinued therapy.

Pemigatinib is a selective, oral inhibitor of FGFR1-3 with antitumor activity. We report the efficacy and safety of pemigatinib in the open-label, single-arm, phase II study of previously treated, unresectable or metastatic UC with FGFR3 alterations (FIGHT-201; NCT02872714). Patients ≥18 years old with FGFR3 mutations or fusions/rearrangements (cohort A) and other FGF/FGFR alterations (cohort B) were included. Patients received pemigatinib 13.5 mg once daily continuously (CD) or intermittently (ID) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary endpoint was centrally confirmed objective response rate (ORR) as per RECIST v1.1 in cohort A-CD. Secondary endpoints included ORR in cohorts A-ID and B, duration of response (DOR), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and safety.

This is a single-arm phase II study. Patients with histopathologically confirmed, resectable locally advanced laryngeal/hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status 0-1 were eligible. Three cycles of induction chemotherapy (paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 d1, cisplatin 25 mg/m2 d1-3) combined with PD-1 inhibitor (toripalimab 240 mg d0) were administered. Response assessment was performed after induction chemoimmunotherapy using RECIST 1.1 criteria. Patients with a complete/partial response of the primary tumor received concurrent chemoradiation, followed by maintenance therapy of toripalimab. Otherwise, patients were referred to surgery, followed by adjuvant (chemo) radiation and maintenance therapy of toripalimab. The primary endpoint is a larynx preservation rate at 3 months postradiation. Twenty-seven patients were enrolled. Most cases exhibited stage IV disease (81.5%), with T4 representing 37.0%. Five patients underwent pretreatment tracheostomy because of impaired larynx function. Overall response rate of induction chemoimmunotherapy was 85.2%. At 3 months postradiation, the larynx preservation rate was 88.9%. With a median follow-up of 18.7 months, the 1-year overall survival rate, progression-free survival rate, and larynx preservation rate were 84.7%, 77.6%, and 88.7%, respectively. When excluding those with pretreatment tracheostomy, the 1-year larynx preservation rate was 95.5%. Exploratory analysis revealed that relapse correlated with enrichment of RNA signature of hypoxia and M2 macrophage-associated genes.

    "abstract": "To explore the auxiliary value of combining CT features with existing response evaluation criteria in the prediction of progressive disease (PD) in gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) patients treated with sunitinib. Eighty-one patients with GISTs who received sunitinib were included in this retrospective multicenter study and divided into training and external validation cohorts. Progression at six months was determined as a reference standard. The predictive performance of the RECIST 1.1 and Choi criteria was compared. CT features at baseline and the first follow-up were analyzed. Logistic regression analyses were used to determine the most significant predictors and develop modified criteria. A total of 216 lesions showed a good response and 107 showed a poor response in 81 patients. The RECIST 1.1 criteria performed better than the Choi criteria in predicting progression (AUC, 0.75 vs. 0.69, p = 0.04). The expanded/intensified high-enhancement area, blurred tumor-tissue interface, and progressive enlarged vessels feeding or draining the mass (EVFDM) differed significantly between lesions with good and poor responses in the training cohort (p = 0.001, 0.003, and 0.000, respectively). Multivariate analysis revealed that the expanded/intensified high-enhancement area (p = 0.001), progressive EVFDM (p = 0.000), and RECIST PD (p = 0.000) were independent predictive factors. Modified RECIST (mRECIST) criteria were developed and showed significantly higher AUCs in the training and external validation cohorts than the RECIST 1.1 criteria (training: 0.81 vs. 0.73, p = 0.002; validation: 0.82 vs. 0.77, p = 0.04). The mRECIST criteria, combining CT features with the RECIST 1.1 criteria, demonstrated superior performance in the prediction of early progression in GIST patients receiving sunitinib. The mRECIST criteria, which combine CT features with the RECIST 1.1 criteria, may facilitate the early detection of progressive disease in GIST patients treated with sunitinib, thereby potentially guiding the timely switch to late-line medications or combination with surgical excision. • The RECIST 1.1 criteria outperformed the Choi criteria in identifying progression of GISTs in patients treated with sunitinib. • GISTs displayed different morphologic features on CT depending on how they responded to sunitinib. • Combining CT morphologic features with the RECIST 1.1 criteria allowed for the prompt and accurate identification of progressing GIST lesions.",

    "abstract": "Conventional transarterial chemoembolization (cTACE) utilizing ethiodized oil as a chemotherapy carrier has become a standard treatment for intermediate-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and has been adopted as a bridging and downstaging therapy for liver transplantation. Water-in-oil emulsion made up of ethiodized oil and chemotherapy solution is retained in tumor vasculature resulting in high tissue drug concentration and low systemic chemotherapy doses. The density and distribution pattern of ethiodized oil within the tumor on post-treatment imaging are predictive of the extent of tumor necrosis and duration of response to treatment. This review describes the multiple roles of ethiodized oil, particularly in its role as a biomarker of tumor response to cTACE. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: With the increasing complexity of locoregional therapy options, including the use of combination therapies, treatment response assessment has become challenging; Ethiodized oil deposition patterns can serve as an imaging biomarker for the prediction of treatment response, and perhaps predict post-treatment prognosis. KEY POINTS: • Treatment response assessment after locoregional therapy to hepatocellular carcinoma is fraught with multiple challenges given the varied post-treatment imaging appearance. • Ethiodized oil is unique in that its' radiopacity can serve as an imaging biomarker to help predict treatment response. • The pattern of deposition of ethiodozed oil has served as a mechanism to detect portions of tumor that are undertreated and can serve as an adjunct to enhancement in order to improve management in patients treated with intraarterial embolization with ethiodized oil.",

    "abstract": "A single arm, phase II trial of carboplatin, nab-paclitaxel, and pembrolizumab (CNP) in metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (mTNBC) was designed to evaluate overall response rate (ORR), progression-free survival (PFS), duration of response (DOR), safety/tolerability, overall survival (OS), and identify pathologic and transcriptomic correlates of response to therapy. Patients with ≤2 prior therapies for metastatic disease were treated with CNP regardless of tumor programmed cell death-ligand 1 status. Core tissue biopsies were obtained prior to treatment initiation. ORR was assessed using a binomial distribution. Survival was analyzed via the Kaplan-Meier method. Bulk RNA sequencing was employed for correlative studies. Thirty patients were enrolled. The ORR was 48.0%: 2 (7%) complete responses (CR), 11 (41%) partial responses (PR), and 8 (30%) stable disease (SD). The median DOR for patients with CR or PR was 6.4 months [95% confidence interval (CI), 4-8.5 months]. For patients with CR, DOR was >24 months. Overall median PFS and OS were 5.8 (95% CI, 4.7-8.5 months) and 13.4 months (8.9-17.3 months), respectively. We identified unique transcriptomic landscapes associated with each RECIST category of radiographic treatment response. In CR and durable PR, IGHG1 expression was enriched. IGHG1high tumors were associated with improved OS (P = 0.045) and were concurrently enriched with B cells and follicular helper T cells, indicating IGHG1 as a promising marker for lymphocytic infiltration and robust response to chemo-immunotherapy. Pretreatment tissue sampling in mTNBC treated with CNP reveals transcriptomic signatures that may predict radiographic responses to chemo-immunotherapy.",

    "title": "Xaluritamig, a STEAP1 × CD3 XmAb 2+1 Immune Therapy for Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer: Results from Dose Exploration in a First-in-Human Study.",
    "abstract": "Xaluritamig (AMG 509) is a six-transmembrane epithelial antigen of the prostate 1 (STEAP1)-targeted T-cell engager designed to facilitate lysis of STEAP1-expressing cancer cells, such as those in advanced prostate cancer. This first-in-human study reports monotherapy dose exploration for patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), primarily taxane pretreated. Ninety-seven patients received ≥1 intravenous dose ranging from 0.001 to 2.0 mg weekly or every 2 weeks. MTD was identified as 1.5 mg i.v. weekly via a 3-step dose. The most common treatment-related adverse events were cytokine release syndrome (CRS; 72%), fatigue (45%), and myalgia (34%). CRS occurred primarily during cycle 1 and improved with premedication and step dosing. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and RECIST responses across cohorts were encouraging [49% PSA50; 24% objective response rate (ORR)], with greater frequency at target doses ≥0.75 mg (59% PSA50; 41% ORR). Xaluritamig is a novel immunotherapy for prostate cancer that has shown encouraging results supporting further development. Xaluritamig demonstrated encouraging responses (PSA and RECIST) compared with historical established treatments for patients with late-line mCRPC. This study provides proof of concept for T-cell engagers as a potential treatment for prostate cancer, validates STEAP1 as a target, and supports further clinical investigation of xaluritamig in prostate cancer.

In total, 355 FDA-approved cancer drug indications with 841 special designations were identified (2012-2022). Trial, epidemiology, and price data were collected from FDA labels, the Global Burden of Disease study, and Medicare and Medicaid. The association between efficacy outcomes and indications' number of special designations were compared in meta-analyses. Median development times were 7.3, 7.8, and 5.4 months (P = .027) for drugs with 0 to 1, 2 to 3, and 4 to 5 special designations, respectively. Multiple special designations were associated with higher biotechnological and clinical innovation. Median patient enrollment in trials were 615, 471, 398, 168, 104, and 120 (P < .001) for indications with 0 to 5 special designations. Drugs for rare diseases supported by open-label phase 1/2 trials of single-arm design were granted more special designations. Hazard ratios for overall survival (0.80 vs 0.73 vs 0.73 vs 0.69 vs 0.56 vs 0.52; P = .003) and progression-free survival (0.70 vs 0.61 vs 0.59 vs 0.44 vs 0.37 vs 0.67; P < .001) substantially declined while tumor response increased with more special designations. Mean monthly prices increased for drugs with 0 to 4 but not 5 special designations ($21 596 vs $14 753 vs $32 410 vs $41 240 vs $38 703 vs $19 184). Multiple special designations are associated with faster clinical development and greater benefits for patients with unmet needs but also with nonrobust trial evidence and a tendency toward higher drug prices.",

    "abstract": "To investigate the efficacy, safety, and biomarkers of systemic chemotherapy with oxaliplatin, leucovorin, and 5-fluorouracil (FOLFOX) in combination with lenvatinib and toripalimab as the first-line treatment for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with extrahepatic metastasis. In this biomolecular exploratory, phase II trial, eligible patients underwent the triple combination therapy of lenvatinib, toripalimab, plus FOLFOX chemotherapy. Primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) rate at 6 months by RECIST v1.1. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) of tumor biopsy samples was performed for exploratory biomarker analyses. Between November 19, 2019, and July 4, 2021, 30 patients were enrolled. The primary endpoint was a 6-month PFS rate of 66.7%, with a median PFS of 9.73 months [95% confidence interval (CI), 2.89-16.58]. The median overall survival (OS) was 14.63 months (95% CI, 11.77-17.50), with an objective response rate of 43.3%. Twenty-four (80.0%) patients exhibited high-risk features, among whom the median OS and PFS were 13.7 months (95% CI, 9.24-18.16) and 8.3 months (95% CI, 3.02-13.58), respectively. The most common adverse events were neutropenia, and increased aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase levels. Exploratory analyses of snRNA-seq profiles suggested that patients with higher abundance of tumor-infiltrating immune cells were more likely to benefit from this combination. In addition, two subtypes of hepatocytes (AKR1C2+ and CFHR4+ malignant hepatocytes) were associated with reduced clinical benefits. FOLFOX chemotherapy in combination with lenvatinib and toripalimab showed promising antitumor activity with manageable toxicities in advanced HCC with extrahepatic metastasis. AKR1C2+ and CFHR4+ hepatocyte subtypes may be predictive biomarkers of resistance to the combination therapy.",

A retrospective review was performed of patients with localized iCCA treated with SIRT at a single institution. Overall survival (OS), local tumor response, progression-free survival (PFS), and toxicity were collected. Stratified analysis was performed based on surgical resection. Predictor analysis of OS was performed using the Fine-Grey regression analysis model with patients bridged to surgery regarded as competing events. A total of 28 consecutive patients with localized iCCA were treated with a total of 38 sessions of SIRT (17 segmental, 13 lobar, and 8 combined deliveries) and a mean dominant target dose per session of 238.4 ± 130.0 Gy. The cumulative radiologic response rate was 16/28 (57.1%) with a median PFS of 265 days. Median survival time (MST) was 22.9 months for the entire cohort with 1-year and 3-year survival of 78.4% and 45.1%, respectively. Ten patients (34.5%) were downstaged to surgical intervention (7 resection, 3 transplant) and showed longer OS (p = 0.027).

In this study, we aimed to investigate the safety and efficacy of the albumin binder-conjugated FAP-targeted radiopharmaceutical, 177Lu-EB-FAPI (177Lu-LNC1004), in patients with metastatic radioiodine-refractory thyroid cancer (mRAIR-TC). This open-label, non-randomized, first-in-human, dose-escalation, investigator-initiated trial had a 3+3 design and involved a 6-week 177Lu-LNC1004 treatment cycle in patients with mRAIR-TC at 2.22 GBq initially, with subsequent cohorts receiving an incremental 50% dose increase until dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) was observed. 177Lu-LNC1004 administration was well tolerated, with no life-threatening adverse events observed. No patients experienced DLT in Group A (2.22 GBq/cycle). One patient experienced grade 4 thrombocytopenia in Group B (3.33 GBq/cycle); hence, another three patients were enrolled, none of whom experienced DLT. Two patients experienced grade 3 and 4 hematotoxicity in Group C (4.99 GBq/cycle). The mean whole-body effective dose was 0.17 ± 0.04 mSv/MBq. Intense 177Lu-LNC1004 uptake and prolonged tumor retention resulted in high mean absorbed tumor doses (8.50 ± 12.36 Gy/GBq). The mean effective half-lives for the whole-body and tumor lesions were 90.20 ± 7.68 and 92.46 ± 9.66 hours, respectively. According to RECIST, partial response, stable disease, and progressive disease were observed in 3 (25%), 7 (58%), and 2 (17%) patients, respectively. The objective response and disease control rates were 25% and 83%, respectively. FAP-targeted radioligand therapy with 177Lu-LNC1004 at 3.33 GBq/cycle was well tolerated in patients with advanced mRAIR-TC, with high radiation dose delivery to the tumor lesions, encouraging therapeutic efficacy, and acceptable side effects.",

    "abstract": "Immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting PD-1 or CTLA-4 individually have shown substantial clinical benefits in the treatment of malignancies. We aimed to assess the safety and antitumour activity of cadonilimab monotherapy, a bispecific PD-1/CTLA-4 antibody, in patients with advanced solid tumours. This multicentre, open-label, phase 1b/2 trial was conducted across 30 hospitals in China. Patients aged 18 years or older with histologically or cytologically confirmed, unresectable advanced solid tumours, unsuccessful completion of at least one previous systemic therapy, and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1 were eligible for inclusion. Patients who had previously received anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or anti-CTLA-4 treatment were not eligible for inclusion. In the dose escalation phase of phase 1b, patients received intravenous cadonilimab at 6 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks. In the dose expansion phase of phase 1b, cadonilimab at 6 mg/kg and a fixed dose of 450 mg were given intravenously every 2 weeks. In phase 2, cadonilimab at 6 mg/kg was administered intravenously every 2 weeks in three cohorts: patients with cervical cancer, oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma, and hepatocellular carcinoma. The primary endpoints were the safety of cadonilimab in phase 1b and objective response rate in phase 2, based on the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), version 1.1. The safety analysis was done in all patients who received at least one dose of cadonilimab. Antitumour activity was assessed in the full analysis set for the cervical cancer cohort, and in all patients with measurable disease at baseline and who received at least one dose of cadonilimab in the oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma and hepatocellular carcinoma cohorts. The study is registered on ClinicalTrial.gov, NCT03852251, and closed to new participants; follow-up has been completed. Between Jan 18, 2019, and Jan 8, 2021, 240 patients (83 [43 male and 40 female] in phase 1b and 157 in phase 2) were enrolled. Phase 2 enrolled 111 female patients with cervical cancer, 22 patients with oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (15 male and seven female), and 24 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (17 male and seven female). During dose escalation, no dose-limiting toxicities occurred. Grade 3-4 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 67 (28%) of 240 patients; the most frequent grade 3 or worse treatment-related adverse events were anaemia (seven [3%]), increased lipase (four [2%]), decreased bodyweight (three [1%]), decreased appetite (four [2%]), decreased neutrophil count (three [1%]), and infusion-related reaction (two [1%]). 17 (7%) patients discontinued treatment due to treatment-related adverse events. 54 (23%) of 240 patients reported serious treatment-related adverse events, including five patients who died (one due to myocardial infarction; cause unknown for four). In phase 2, in the cervical cancer cohort, with a median follow-up of 14·6 months (IQR 13·1-17·5), the objective response rate was 32·3% (32 of 99; 95% CI 23·3-42·5). In the oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma cohort, with a median follow-up of 17·9 months (IQR 4·0-15·1), the objective response rate was 18·2% (four of 22; 95% CI 5·2-40·3). In the hepatocellular carcinoma cohort, with a median follow-up of 19·6 months (IQR 8·7-19·8), the objective response rate was 16·7% (four of 24; 95% CI 4·7-37·4).

Eligible Japanese patients (HLA-A*02:01 or *02:06, NY-ESO-1-positive tumor expression) received cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m2 on days -3 and -2 (induction period) followed by a single dose of 5×109 (±30%) TBI-1301 cells as a divided infusion on days 0 and 1 (treatment period). Primary endpoints were safety-related (phase I) and efficacy-related [objective response rate (ORR) by RECIST v1.1/immune-related RECIST (irRECIST); phase II]. Safety- and efficacy-related secondary endpoints were considered in both phase I/II parts. For the full analysis set (N = 8; phase I, n = 3; phase II, n = 5), the ORR was 50.0% (95% confidence interval, 15.7-84.3) with best overall partial response in four of eight patients according to RECIST v1.1/irRECIST. All patients experienced adverse events and seven of eight patients (87.5%) had adverse drug reactions, but no deaths were attributed to adverse events. Cytokine release syndrome occurred in four of eight patients (50.0%), but all cases recovered with prespecified treatment. Immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome, replication-competent retrovirus, and lymphocyte clonality were absent.

This retrospective study included 150 and 214 patients with HCC who received combination therapy in training and validation cohorts. The medical images and AFP levels obtained at baseline and 6th week were collected. AFP response stratification: partial response (PR): AFP% ≥ 75% decline; stable disease (SD): AFP% < 75% decline and  ≤ 10% elevation; progressive disease (PD): AFP% > 10% elevation. The alpha-RECIST was: PR: RECIST 1.1-PR or AFP-PR; PD: AFP-PD or RECIST 1.1-PD and does not satisfy AFP-PR; SD: neither PR nor PD. OS was compared using Kaplan-Meier curves. The predictive ability of various criteria was evaluated using the concordance index and time-dependent area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve. RECIST 1.1 achieved significant OS stratification (p = 0.020) for AFP < 20 ng/mL. For AFP ≥ 20 ng/mL, alpha-RECIST showed better performance than RECIST 1.1, mRECIST, and AFP response according to C-index (0.73 vs 0.66 vs 0.68 vs 0.69).

    "abstract": "Tumors activate protein kinase R (PKR)-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK, also called EIF2AK3) in response to hypoxia and nutrient deprivation as a stress-mitigation strategy. Here, we tested the hypothesis that inhibiting PERK with HC-5404 enhances the antitumor efficacy of standard-of-care VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (VEGFR-TKI). HC-5404 was characterized as a potent and selective PERK inhibitor, with favorable in vivo properties. Multiple renal cell carcinoma (RCC) tumor models were then cotreated with both HC-5404 and VEGFR-TKI in vivo, measuring tumor volume across time and evaluating tumor response by protein analysis and IHC. VEGFR-TKI including axitinib, cabozantinib, lenvatinib, and sunitinib induce PERK activation in 786-O RCC xenografts. Cotreatment with HC-5404 inhibited PERK in tumors and significantly increased antitumor effects of VEGFR-TKI across multiple RCC models, resulting in tumor stasis or regression. Analysis of tumor sections revealed that HC-5404 enhanced the antiangiogenic effects of axitinib and lenvatinib by inhibiting both new vasculature and mature tumor blood vessels. Xenografts that progress on axitinib monotherapy remain sensitive to the combination treatment, resulting in ∼20% tumor regression in the combination group. When tested across a panel of 18 RCC patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models, the combination induced greater antitumor effects relative to monotherapies. In this single animal study, nine out of 18 models responded with ≥50% tumor regression from baseline in the combination group. By disrupting an adaptive stress response evoked by VEGFR-TKI, HC-5404 presents a clinical opportunity to improve the antitumor effects of well-established standard-of-care therapies in RCC.",

    "abstract": "An accurate and noninvasive assessment of tumor response following treatment other than traditional anatomical imaging techniques is essential. Deuterium magnetic resonance spectroscopic (MRS) imaging has been demonstrated as an alternative for cancer metabolic imaging by high-field MRI using deuterium-labeled molecules. The study aim was to use 2H tissue labeling and deuterium MRI at clinical field strength for tumor visualization and assessment of three anticancer therapies in pancreatic cancer model mice. MIA PaCa-2 pancreatic carcinoma and C26 colorectal carcinoma models of BALB/c-nu mice was prepared, and repeated deuterium MRI was performed during the first 10 days of free drinking of 30% D2O to track 2H distribution in tissues. 2H accumulation in the tumor after irradiation, bevacizumab administration, or gemcitabine administration was also measured in MIA PaCa-2-bearing mice. Confirmatory proton MRI, ex vivo metabolic hyperpolarization 13C-MRS, and histopathology were performed. The mouse's whole-body distribution of 2H was visible 1 day after drinking, and the signal intensity increased daily. Although the tumor size did not change 1 and 3 days after irradiation, the amount of 2H decreased significantly. The 2H image intensity of the tumor also significantly decreased after the administration of bevacizumab or gemcitabine. Metabolic hyperpolarization 13C-MRS, proton MRI, and 2H-NMR spectroscopy confirmed the efficacy of the anticancer treatments. Deuterium MRI at 1.5T proved feasible to track 2H distribution throughout mouse tissues during D2O administration and revealed a higher 2H accumulation in the tumor xenografts. This research demonstrated a promising successful method for preliminary assessment of radiotherapy and chemotherapy of cancer.",

Intriguingly, SHP2 has also been described as a critical regulator of the tumor microenvironment. Based on this evidence SHP2 is considered a multifaceted target in cancer, spurring the notion that the development of direct inhibitors of SHP2 would provide the twofold benefit of tumor intrinsic and extrinsic inhibition. In this review, we will discuss the role of SHP2 in cancer and the tumor microenvironment, and the clinical strategies in which SHP2 inhibitors are leveraged as combination agents to improve therapeutic response. The SHP2 phosphatase functions as a pleiotropic factor, and its inhibition not only hinders tumor growth but also reshapes the tumor microenvironment. Although their single-agent activity may be limited, SHP2 inhibitors hold the potential of being key combination agents to enhance the depth and the durability of tumor response to therapy.",

Purpose To develop and validate a predictive model for identifying proliferative HCCs using CT imaging features and to compare therapeutic outcomes between predicted proliferative and nonproliferative HCCs after cTACE according to this model. Materials and Methods This retrospective multicenter study included adults with HCC who underwent liver resection or cTACE between August 2013 and December 2020. A CT-based predictive model for identifying proliferative HCCs was developed and externally validated in a cohort that underwent resection. Diagnostic performance was calculated for the model. Thereafter, patients in the cTACE cohort were stratified into groups with predicted proliferative or nonproliferative HCCs according to the model. The primary outcome was overall survival (OS), and the secondary outcomes were tumor response rate and progression-free survival (PFS). These were compared between the two groups with use of the χ",

The single-arm, phase 2 RAGNAR study was conducted at 156 investigative centres (hospitals or oncology practices that are qualified oncology study centres) across 15 countries. The study consisted of four cohorts based on tumour histology and patient age; the results reported in this Article are for the primary cohort of the study, defined as the Broad Panel Cohort, which was histology-agnostic. We recruited patients aged 12 years or older with advanced or metastatic tumours of any histology (except urothelial cancer) with predefined FGFR1-4 alterations (mutations or fusions according to local or central testing). Eligible patients had disease progression on at least one previous line of systemic therapy and no alternative standard therapy available to them, and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-1 (or equivalent for adolescents aged 12-17 years). Patients received once-daily oral erdafitinib (8 mg/day with provision for pharmacodynamically guided up-titration to 9 mg/day) on a continuous 21-day cycle until disease progression or intolerable toxicity. The primary endpoint was objective response rate by independent review committee according to Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST), version 1.1, or Response Assessment In Neuro-Oncology (RANO). The primary analysis was conducted on the treated population of the Broad Panel Cohort. This ongoing study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT04083976. Patients were recruited between Dec 5, 2019, and Feb 15, 2022. Of 217 patients treated with erdafitinib, 97 (45%) patients were female and 120 (55%) were male. The data cutoff was Aug 15, 2022. At a median follow-up of 17·9 months (IQR 13·6-23·9), an objective response was observed in 64 (30% [95% CI 24-36]) of 217 patients across 16 distinct tumour types. The most common grade 3 or higher treatment-emergent adverse events related to erdafitinib were stomatitis (25 [12%]), palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome (12 [6%]), and hyperphosphataemia (11 [5%]). The most commonly occurring serious treatment-related adverse events (grade 3 or higher) were stomatitis in four (2%) patients and diarrhoea in two (1%). There were no treatment-related deaths. RAGNAR results show clinical benefit for erdafitinib in the tumour-agnostic setting in patients with advanced solid tumours with susceptible FGFR alterations who have exhausted other treatment options. These results support the continued development of FGFR inhibitors in patients with advanced solid tumours. Janssen Research & Development.",

    "abstract": "Determinants of treatment outcomes to chemotherapy-based regimens in metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) remain ill-defined. Our aim was to examine tissue-based correlates of treatment response and resistance using matched baseline and on-treatment biopsies collected from patients with PDA treated in the first-line metastatic setting. Patients with treatment-naïve metastatic PDA were enrolled in a Phase II trial (NCT02077881) investigating gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel in combination with indoximod, an orally administered small-molecule inhibitor of the IDO pathway. Baseline and on-treatment biopsies (week 8) of metastatic lesions (88% liver) were collected from a cohort of responders (N = 8) and non-responders (N = 8) based on RECIST v1.1 and examined by multiplex IHC and mRNA sequencing. Treatment altered the transcriptional profile of metastatic lesions with a decrease in tumor cell proliferation independent of treatment response. The antiproliferative response was seen in both basal and classical PDA subtypes. PDA subtype was not associated with survival outcomes; instead, genes involved in immune activation distinguished responders from non-responders. Tumor response was associated with an increase in CD3+ and CD8+ T-cell infiltrates into metastatic lesions. A composite of decreased tumor proliferation in response to treatment and increased CD8 T-cell infiltration in metastatic lesions identified responders and associated with a favorable survival outcome. Our findings suggest that inhibiting cancer cell proliferation alone in PDA is insufficient to produce tumor responses and support a role for tumor-extrinsic mechanisms, such as CD8+ T cells, which combine with the cancer cell proliferation index to define treatment outcomes.",

    "abstract": "To compare liver metastases changes in CT assessed by radiologists using RECIST 1.1 and with aided simultaneous deep learning-based volumetric lesion changes analysis. A total of 86 abdominal CT studies from 43 patients (prior and current scans) of abdominal CT scans of patients with 1041 liver metastases (mean = 12.1, std = 11.9, range 1-49) were analyzed. Two radiologists performed readings of all pairs; conventional with RECIST 1.1 and with computer-aided assessment. For computer-aided reading, we used a novel simultaneous multi-channel 3D R2U-Net classifier trained and validated on other scans. The reference was established by having an expert radiologist validate the computed lesion detection and segmentation. The results were then verified and modified as needed by another independent radiologist. The primary outcome measure was the disease status assessment with the conventional and the computer-aided readings with respect to the reference. For conventional and computer-aided reading, there was a difference in disease status classification in 40 out of 86 (46.51%) and 10 out of 86 (27.9%) CT studies with respect to the reference, respectively. Computer-aided reading improved conventional reading in 30 CT studies by 34.5% for two readers (23.2% and 46.51%) with respect to the reference standard. The main reason for the difference between the two readings was lesion volume differences (p = 0.01). AI-based computer-aided analysis of liver metastases may improve the accuracy of the evaluation of neoplastic liver disease status. AI may aid radiologists to improve the accuracy of evaluating changes over time in metastasis of the liver. • Classification of liver metastasis changes improved significantly in one-third of the cases with an automatically generated comprehensive lesion and lesion changes report. • Simultaneous deep learning changes detection and volumetric assessment may improve the evaluation of liver metastases temporal changes potentially improving disease management.",

    "abstract": "Glioblastoma (GBM) is a highly vascularized tumor with few treatment options after disease recurrence. Here, we report the efficacy and safety of anlotinib hydrochloride plus temozolomide in patients with recurrent GBM. Patients with first definite postsurgical progression of histologically confirmed GBM preceded by standard radiotherapy and temozolomide chemotherapy were eligible for inclusion. All patients received temozolomide (150-200 mg/m2, orally, every day (QD) d1-5/4 wk) and anlotinib (10 mg, orally, QD, d1-14/3 wk) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed 6-month progression-free survival (PFS) rate by the Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) criteria. Twenty-one patients were enrolled between May 2020 and July 2021, with a median age of 55 (range 27-68) years old. According to the Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) criteria, tumor response occurred in 17 patients, of which 9 patients had a complete response, and the objective response rate was 81.0% [95% confidence interval (CI), 62.6-99.3]. The disease control rate was 95.2% (95% CI, 76.2-99.9), with three additional patients achieving a stable disease without tumor progression. The median PFS was 7.3 months (95% CI, 4.9-9.7), and the 6-month PFS rate was 61.9% (95% CI, 39.3-84.6). The median overall survival was 16.9 months (95% CI, 7.8-26.0). The most common adverse events were leukocytopenia (66.7%), thrombocytopenia (38.1%), and hypertriglyceridemia (38.1%). Five patients had nine grade 3 adverse events, with a 23.8% incidence rate. Two patients discontinued therapy due to ischemic stroke (grade 3) and wound dehiscence (grade 1), respectively. No grade 4 or treatment-related deaths occurred in this study.

This retrospective study evaluated outcomes in treatment-naïve patients who received chemoembolization as first-line treatment for intermediate-stage infiltrative HCC between 2002 and 2022. Of the 2029 treatment-naïve patients who received chemoembolization as first-line treatment for intermediate-stage HCC, 244 (12%) were identified as having the infiltrative type. After excluding two patients lost to follow-up, 242 patients were evaluated. Median post-chemoembolization overall survival (OS) was 16 months. Multivariable Cox analysis identified four factors predictive of OS: Child-Pugh class B (hazard ratio [HR], 1.84; p = 0.001), maximal tumor size ≥ 10 cm (HR, 1.67; p < 0.001), tumor number ≥ 4 (HR, 1.42; p = 0.037), and bilobar tumor involvement (HR, 1.64; p = 0.003). These four factors were used to create pretreatment prediction models, with risk scores of 0-1, 2-4, and 5-7 defined as low, intermediate, and high risk, respectively. Median OS times in these three groups were 34, 18, and 8 months, respectively (p < 0.001). The objective tumor response rate following chemoembolization was 53%.

This phase I/IIa pilot trial evaluated preliminary efficacy and safety of combination of radioembolization with yttrium-90 microspheres (Y90-radioembolization) and durvalumab in patients with locally advanced unresectable HCC. Patients with Child-Pugh score ≤ 7 and locally advanced HCC, defined as Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage B HCC or BCLC-C disease without extrahepatic metastases, received Y90-radioembolization followed by intravenous durvalumab 1,500 mg 7 to 14 days after Y90-radioembolization and every 4 weeks thereafter. Primary endpoint was time to progression (TTP) assessed by modified RECIST (mRECIST). Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), objective response rate (ORR) determined by mRECIST, and safety. All 24 patients enrolled received Y90-radioembolization and 23 received at least one dose of durvalumab. Median follow-up duration was 19.0 months (range, 2.2-24.2). Median TTP was 15.2 months [95% confidence interval (CI), 6.1-not estimated]. Median OS was not reached and 18-month OS rate was 58.3% (95% CI, 36.4-75.0).

    "abstract": "In the evolving molecular treatment landscape of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC), the identification of druggable alterations is pivotal to achieve the best therapeutic opportunity for each patient. Because the number of actionable targets is expanding, there is the need to timely detect their presence or emergence to guide the choice of different available treatment options. Liquid biopsy, through the analysis of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), has proven safe and effective as a complementary method to address cancer evolution while overcoming the limitations of tissue biopsy. Even though data are accumulating regarding the potential for ctDNA-guided treatments applied to targeted agents, still major gaps in knowledge exist as for their application to different areas of the continuum of care. In this review, we recapitulate how ctDNA information could be exploited to drive different targeted treatment strategies in mCRC patients, by refining molecular selection before treatment by addressing tumor heterogeneity beyond tumor tissue biopsy; longitudinally monitoring early-tumor response and resistance mechanisms to targeted agents, potentially leading to tailored, molecular-driven, therapeutic options; guiding the molecular triage towards rechallenge strategies with anti-EGFR agents, suggesting the best time for retreatment; and providing opportunities for an \"enhanced rechallenge\" through additional treatments or combos aimed at overcoming acquired resistance. Besides, we discuss future perspectives concerning the potential role of ctDNA to fine-tune investigational strategies such as immuno-oncology.",

    "abstract": "Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have revolutionized the management of advanced melanoma (AM). However, data on ICI effectiveness have largely been restricted to clinical trials, thereby excluding patients with co-existing malignancies. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the most prevalent adult leukemia and is associated with increased risk of melanoma. CLL alters systemic immunity and can induce T-cell exhaustion, which may limit the efficacy of ICIs in patients with CLL. We, therefore, sought to examine the efficacy of ICI in patients with these co-occurring diagnoses. In this international multicenter study, a retrospective review of clinical databases identified patients with concomitant diagnoses of CLL and AM treated with ICI (US-MD Anderson Cancer Center, N = 24; US-Mayo Clinic, N = 15; AUS, N = 19). Objective response rates (ORRs), assessed by RECIST v1.1, and survival outcomes [overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS)] among patients with CLL and AM were assessed. Clinical factors associated with improved ORR and survival were explored. Additionally, ORR and survival outcomes were compared between the Australian CLL/AM cohort and a control cohort of 148 Australian patients with AM alone. Between 1997 and 2020, 58 patients with concomitant CLL and AM were treated with ICI. ORRs were comparable between AUS-CLL/AM and AM control cohorts (53% versus 48%, P = 0.81). PFS and OS from ICI initiation were also comparable between cohorts. Among CLL/AM patients, a majority were untreated for their CLL (64%) at the time of ICI. Patients with prior history of chemoimmunotherapy treatment for CLL (19%) had significantly reduced ORRs, PFS, and OS. Our case series of patients with concomitant CLL and melanoma demonstrate frequent, durable clinical responses to ICI. However, those with prior chemoimmunotherapy treatment for CLL had significantly worse outcomes. We found that CLL disease course is largely unchanged by treatment with ICI.",

    "title": "Integrating On-Treatment Modified Glasgow Prognostic Score and Imaging to Predict Response and Outcomes in Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma.",
    "abstract": "In the era of immuno-oncology, imaging alone seems to be insufficient to capture treatment responses, as patients with stable disease treated with immunotherapy have a wide range of clinical outcomes. There is an unmet need for complementary (ideally cost-efficient) markers that enable assessment of therapy response and outcomes in conjunction with imaging. To examine whether longitudinal changes in the modified Glasgow prognostic score (mGPS), which is based on C-reactive protein and albumin, can predict responses and outcomes in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC). This post hoc analysis, conducted from October 2022 to April 2023, evaluated the prognostic and predictive performance of on-treatment mGPS in patients with mRCC being treated with atezolizumab (plus bevacizumab) or sunitinib in 2 randomized clinical trials: the phase 3 IMmotion151 study (discovery cohort) and the phase 2 IMmotion150 study (validation cohort). Outcomes were investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), version 1.1 and overall survival (OS) for survival analyses. To compare the prognostic value of the on-treatment mGPS with radiologic staging, we used RECIST assessed by the Independent Review Committee (IRC-RECIST) to ensure high data quality. Of the 915 patients with mRCC in the IMmotion151 discovery cohort, baseline mGPS was available for 861 patients and on-treatment mGPS for 691. The IMmotion150 validation cohort included 305 patients with mRCC, and on-treatment mGPS could be evaluated for 199. In the IMmotion150 study, on-treatment mGPS predicted outcomes as early as 6 weeks following therapy initiation, thereby opening a window for early therapy adjustments. In both clinical trials, on-treatment mGPS provided valuable prognostic information regardless of imaging-assessed treatment response at first staging. Of note, in the disease control subgroup, on-treatment mGPS exhibited superior and independent prognostic information compared with IRC-RECIST (available for 611 patients; C-index, 0.651 [95% CI, 0.588-0.714] for the mGPS during treatment vs 0.574 [95% CI, 0.528-0.619] for IRC-RECIST). These data support the concept of integrating on-treatment mGPS for more holistic and patient-centered therapy monitoring in addition to radiologic staging to improve clinical care at a low cost for patients with mRCC.",

    "abstract": "To report the safety and efficacy of ipatasertib (AKT inhibitor) combined with rucaparib (PARP inhibitor) in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) previously treated with second-generation androgen receptor inhibitors. In this two-part phase Ib trial (NCT03840200), patients with advanced prostate, breast, or ovarian cancer received ipatasertib (300 or 400 mg daily) plus rucaparib (400 or 600 mg twice daily) to assess safety and identify a recommended phase II dose (RP2D). A part 1 dose-escalation phase was followed by a part 2 dose-expansion phase in which only patients with mCRPC received the RP2D. The primary efficacy endpoint was prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response (≥50% reduction) in patients with mCRPC. Patients were not selected on the basis of tumor mutational status. Fifty-one patients were enrolled (part 1 = 21; part 2 = 30). Ipatasertib 400 mg daily plus rucaparib 400 mg twice daily was the selected RP2D, received by 37 patients with mCRPC. Grade 3/4 adverse events occurred in 46% (17/37) of patients, with one grade 4 adverse event (anemia, deemed related to rucaparib) and no deaths. Adverse events leading to treatment modification occurred in 70% (26/37). The PSA response rate was 26% (9/35), and the objective response rate per Response Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 was 10% (2/21). Median radiographic progression-free survival per Prostate Cancer Working Group 3 criteria was 5.8 months [95% confidence interval (CI), 4.0-8.1], and median overall survival was 13.3 months (95% CI, 10.9-not evaluable). Ipatasertib plus rucaparib was manageable with dose modification but did not demonstrate synergistic or additive antitumor activity in previously treated patients with mCRPC.",

    "abstract": "On January 19, 2023, the FDA granted accelerated approval to tucatinib in combination with trastuzumab for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic RAS wild-type, HER2-positive colorectal cancer who have received prior treatment with fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan. Approval was based on the pooled analysis of patients receiving tucatinib in combination with trastuzumab in MOUNTAINEER (NCT03043313), an open-label, multicenter trial. The primary endpoint was overall response rate (ORR) by RECIST 1.1 as per blinded central review committee (BIRC) assessment. The main secondary endpoint was duration of response (DOR) per BIRC assessment. Eighty-four eligible patients received the combination tucatinib and trastuzumab. With a median follow-up of 16 months, the ORR was 38% [95% confidence interval (CI): 28-49] and median DOR was 12.4 months (95% CI: 8.5-20.5); 81% of responders had a response lasting more than 6 months. The most common adverse reactions observed in at least 20% of patients receiving tucatinib in combination with trastuzumab were diarrhea, fatigue, rash, nausea, abdominal pain, infusion-related reactions, and fever. FDA concluded that the magnitude of ORR and durable responses observed in patients treated with tucatinib in combination with trastuzumab in the MOUNTAINEER trial are clinically meaningful, particularly in the context of a disease with estimated survival of 6-7 months with available therapy. This is the first approval for the subset of patients with HER2-positive colorectal cancer. This article summarizes the FDA's thought process and review of the data supporting this accelerated approval.",

    "abstract": "At metastatic stage, treatment of adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) relies in first line on mitotane therapy, combination of mitotane with locoregional therapies or cisplatin-based chemotherapy according to initial presentation. In second line, ESMO-EURACAN recommendations favour enrolment of patients in clinical trials investigating experimental therapies. However, the benefit of this approach remains unknown. The aim of our retrospective study was to analyse the inclusion and outcomes of all patients of the French cohort ENDOCAN-COMETE included in early clinical trials between 2009 and 2019. Of the 141 patients for whom a local or national multidisciplinary tumour board recommended, as first choice, to look for clinical trial, 27 patients (19%) were enroled in 30 early clinical trials. Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 3.02 months (95% confidence interval [95% CI]; 2.3-4.6) and median overall survival (OS) was 10.2 months (95% CI; 7.13-16.3) while the best response, evaluable in 28 of 30 trial participants according to RECIST 1.1 criteria, was partial response for 3 patients (11%) stable disease for 14 patients (50%) and progressive disease for 11 patients (39%), resulting in a disease control rate of 61%. Median growth modulation index (GMI) in our cohort was 1.32, with a significantly prolonged PFS in 52% of the patients compared to the previous line. The Royal Marsden Hospital (RMH) prognostic score was not associated with OS in this cohort. Our study suggests that patients with metastatic ACC benefit from inclusion in early clinical trials in second line. As recommended, if a clinical trial is available, it should be the first choice for suitable patients.",

    "abstract": "MET inhibitors have recently demonstrated clinical activity in patients with MET exon 14 (METex14)-skipping non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC); however, data with longer follow-up and in larger populations are needed to further optimize therapeutic approaches. To assess the long-term efficacy and safety of tepotinib, a potent and highly selective MET inhibitor, in patients with METex14-skipping NSCLC in the VISION study. The VISION phase 2 nonrandomized clinical trial was a multicohort, open-label, multicenter study that enrolled patients with METex14-skipping advanced/metastatic NSCLC (cohorts A and C) from September 2016 to May 2021. Cohort C (>18 months' follow-up) was an independent cohort, designed to confirm findings from cohort A (>35 months' follow-up). Data cutoff was November 20, 2022. Patients received tepotinib, 500 mg (450 mg active moiety), once daily. The primary end point was objective response by independent review committee (RECIST v1.1). Secondary end points included duration of response (DOR), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and safety. Cohorts A and C included 313 patients (50.8% female, 33.9% Asian; median [range] age, 72 [41-94] years). The objective response rate (ORR) was 51.4% (95% CI, 45.8%-57.1%) with a median (m)DOR of 18.0 (95% CI, 12.4-46.4) months. In cohort C (n = 161), an ORR of 55.9% (95% CI, 47.9%-63.7%) with an mDOR of 20.8 (95% CI, 12.6-not estimable [NE]) months was reported across treatment lines, comparable to cohort A (n = 152). In treatment-naive patients (cohorts A and C; n = 164), ORR was 57.3% (95% CI, 49.4%-65.0%) and mDOR was 46.4 (95% CI, 13.8-NE) months. In previously treated patients (n = 149), ORR was 45.0% (95% CI, 36.8%-53.3%) and mDOR was 12.6 (95% CI, 9.5-18.5) months. Peripheral edema, the most common treatment-related adverse event, occurred in 210 patients (67.1%) (35 [11.2%] experienced grade ≥3 events). The findings from cohort C in this nonrandomized clinical trial supported the results from original cohort A. Overall, the long-term outcomes of VISION demonstrated robust and durable clinical activity following treatment with tepotinib, particularly in the treatment-naive setting, in the largest known clinical trial of patients with METex14-skipping NSCLC, supporting the global approvals of tepotinib and enabling clinicians to implement this therapeutic approach for such patients.

However, a proportion of patients with dMMR/MSI mCRC exhibit resistance to ICI. Identification of tools predicting MSI mCRC patient response to ICI is required for the design of future strategies further improving this therapy. We combined high-throughput DNA and RNA sequencing of tumors from 116 patients with MSI mCRC treated with anti-programmed cell death protein 1 ± anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 of the NIPICOL phase II trial (C1, NCT03350126, discovery set) and the ImmunoMSI prospective cohort (C2, validation set). The DNA/RNA predictors whose status was significantly associated with ICI status of response in C1 were subsequently validated in C2. Primary endpoint was progression-free survival by immune RECIST (iRECIST) (iPFS). Analyses showed no impact of previously suggested DNA/RNA indicators of resistance to ICI, e.g. MSIsensor score, tumor mutational burden, or specific cellular and molecular tumoral contingents. By contrast, iPFS under ICI was shown in C1 and C2 to depend both on a multiplex MSI signature involving the mutations of 19 microsatellites hazard ratio cohort C2 (HR iPFS in patients with MSI mCRC can be predicted by simply analyzing the mutational status of DNA microsatellite-containing genes in epithelial tumor cells together with non-epithelial TGFB-related desmoplastic RNA markers.",

    "abstract": "Strategies to implement estrogen therapy for advanced estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer are underdeveloped. Preclinical data suggest that cycling treatment with 17β-estradiol followed by estrogen deprivation can control tumor growth long-term. Postmenopausal women with advanced ER+/HER2- breast cancer with recurrence or progression on ≥ 1 antiestrogen or aromatase inhibitor (AI)-based therapy were eligible. Patients received 17β-estradiol (2 mg orally, three times a day) for 8 weeks followed by AI (physician's choice) for 16 weeks, alternating treatments on an 8-week/16-week schedule until disease progression. Patients then optionally received continuous single-agent treatment until a second instance of disease progression. Endpoints included 24-week clinical benefit and objective response per RECIST, and tumor genetic alterations. Of 19 evaluable patients, clinical benefit rate was 42.1% [95% confidence interval (CI), 23.1%-63.9%] and objective response rate (ORR) was 15.8% (95% CI, 5.7%-37.9%). One patient experienced a grade 3 adverse event related to 17β-estradiol. Among patients who received continuous single-agent treatment until a second instance of disease progression, clinical benefit was observed in 5 of 12 (41.7%) cases. Tumor ER (ESR1) mutations were found by whole-exome profiling in 4 of 7 (57.1%) versus 2 of 9 (22.2%) patients who did versus did not experience clinical benefit from alternating 17β-estradiol/AI therapy. The only two patients to experience objective responses to initial 17β-estradiol had tumor ESR1 mutations. Alternating 17β-estradiol/AI therapy may be a promising treatment for endocrine-refractory ER+ breast cancer, including following progression on CDK4/6 inhibitors or everolimus. Further study is warranted to determine whether the antitumor activity of 17β-estradiol differs according to ESR1 mutation status.",

    "abstract": "IFN signaling in the tumor microenvironment is a critical determinant of both response and resistance of cancer to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI). We hypothesized that distinct patterns of IFN signaling in melanoma are associated with clinical response or resistance to ICIs. Two tissue microarrays containing samples from 97 patients with metastatic melanoma who received nivolumab, pembrolizumab, or a combination of ipilimumab and nivolumab at Yale New Haven Hospital between 2011 and 2017 were randomized into discovery and validation cohorts. Samples were stained and visualized using multiplexed immunofluorescence microscopy for STAT1, STAT1 phosphorylated at Y701 (pSTAT1Y701), and PD-L1, and signals were quantified using the automated quantitative analysis method of quantitative immunofluorescence. Treatment response was assessed using RECIST, and overall survival was analyzed. For in vitro studies, human melanoma cell lines were stimulated with IFNγ and IFNβ, and Western blotting was performed. Pretreatment STAT1 levels were higher in responders to ICIs [complete response/partial response/stable disease (SD) for > 6 months] than in nonresponders (SD < 6 months/progressive disease). Higher pretreatment STAT1 levels were associated with improved survival after ICIs in both the discovery and validation cohorts. Western blot analysis of human melanoma cell lines stimulated with IFN demonstrated distinct patterns of upregulation of STAT1 compared with pSTAT1Y701 and PD-L1. When combining STAT1 and PD-L1 markers, patients with STAT1highPD-L1low tumors had improved survival compared with those with STAT1lowPD-L1high tumors. STAT1 may better predict melanoma response to ICIs than current strategies, and combined STAT1 and PD-L1 biomarkers may provide insight into IFN-responsive versus IFN-resistant states.",

Nevertheless, based on limited published data, the outcome of patients with MSI/dMMR pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) seems poorer when compared to other malignancies. This multi-institutional analysis sought to assess the efficacy and tolerability of ICIs in a large real-world cohort of patients with MSI/dMMR PDAC. We retrospectively collected data from patients with MSI/dMMR advanced PDAC treated with ICIs in 16 centers. Progression-free survival and overall survival were calculated from the start of treatment, and we report objective response and disease control rates according to RECIST V1.1. Thirty-one MSI/dMMR advanced PDAC patients were identified. Twenty-five patients received single-agent anti-PD-1 antibodies, three patients received the combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab and three patients received immunotherapy in combination with chemotherapy. Among 31 evaluable patients, 15 (48.4%) had an objective response (three complete responses and 12 partial responses), and six (19.4%) had stable disease. With a median follow-up of 18 months, the median progression-free survival (PFS) was 26.7 months and the median overall survival (OS) was not reached. Disease control rates (DCRs) among patients with only one line of prior therapy (N = 17) was 76.5%. Grade 3-4 treatment-related adverse events were not observed. This retrospective analysis suggests that ICIs are effective and well tolerated in patients with MSI/dMMR advanced PDAC. Hence, our work supports the use of PD-1 inhibition in this group of patients with high unmet medical need.",

To assess antitumor activity and safety of intraperitoneal (IP) olvimulogene nanivacirepvec (Olvi-Vec) virotherapy and platinum-based chemotherapy with or without bevacizumab in patients with PRROC. This open-label, nonrandomized multisite phase 2 VIRO-15 clinical trial enrolled patients with PRROC with disease progression following their last prior line of therapy from September 2016 to September 2019. Data cutoff was on March 31, 2022, and data were analyzed between April 2022 and September 2022. Olvi-Vec was administered via a temporary IP dialysis catheter as 2 consecutive daily doses (3 × 109 pfu/d) followed by platinum-doublet chemotherapy with or without bevacizumab. Primary outcomes were objective response rate (ORR) via Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) and cancer antigen 125 (CA-125) assay, and progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary outcomes included duration of response (DOR), disease control rate (DCR), safety, and overall survival (OS). Twenty-seven heavily pretreated patients with platinum-resistant (n = 14) or platinum-refractory (n = 13) ovarian cancer were enrolled. The median (range) age was 62 (35-78) years. The median (range) prior lines of therapy were 4 (2-9). All patients completed both Olvi-Vec infusions and chemotherapy. Median follow-up duration was 47.0 months (95% CI, 35.9 months to NA). Overall, ORR by RECIST 1.1 was 54% (95% CI, 33%-74%), with a DOR of 7.6 months (95% CI, 3.7-9.6 months). The DCR was 88% (21/24). The ORR by CA-125 was 85% (95% CI, 65%-96%). Median PFS by RECIST 1.1 was 11.0 months (95% CI, 6.7-13.0 months), and the PFS 6-month rate was 77%. Median PFS was 10.0 months (95% CI, 6.4-NA months) in the platinum-resistant group and 11.4 months (95% CI, 4.3-13.2 months) in the platinum-refractory group. The median OS was 15.7 months (95% CI, 12.3-23.8 months) in all patients, with a median OS of 18.5 months (95% CI, 11.3-23.8 months) in the platinum-resistant group and 14.7 months (95% CI, 10.8-33.6 months) in the platinum-refractory group. Most frequent treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) (any grade, grade 3) were pyrexia (63.0%, 3.7%, respectively) and abdominal pain (51.9%, 7.4%, respectively). There were no grade 4 TRAEs, and no treatment-related discontinuations or deaths. In this phase 2 nonrandomized clinical trial, Olvi-Vec followed by platinum-based chemotherapy with or without bevacizumab as immunochemotherapy demonstrated promising ORR and PFS with a manageable safety profile in patients with PRROC.

Median OS (mOS) on first-line platinum-based therapy without immunotherapy was 17.4 months [95% confidence interval (CI), 14.9-19.5 months].

In a subset of patients treated with ICI in the second-line or later setting, median RECIST PFS (2.5 months; 95% CI, 2.2-2.8) and median real-world PFS based on imaging reports (2.2 months; 95% CI, 1.7-2.6) were similar. In exploratory analysis of the impact of tumor mutational burden (TMB) on survival on ICI treatment in the second-line or higher setting, TMB z-score harmonized across gene panels was associated with improved OS (univariable HR, 0.85; P = 0.03; n = 247 patients). The GENIE BPC cohort provides comprehensive clinicogenomic data for patients with NSCLC, which can improve understanding of real-world patient outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Adaptive therapies that alternate between drug applications and drug-free vacations can exploit competition between sensitive and resistant cells to maximize the time to progression. However, optimal dosing schedules depend on the properties of metastases, which are often not directly measurable in clinical practice. Here, we proposed a framework for estimating features of metastases through tumor response dynamics during the first adaptive therapy treatment cycle. Longitudinal prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels in 16 patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer undergoing adaptive androgen deprivation treatment were analyzed to investigate relationships between cycle dynamics and clinical variables such as Gleason score, the change in the number of metastases over a cycle, and the total number of cycles over the course of treatment. The first cycle of adaptive therapy, which consists of a response period (applying therapy until 50% PSA reduction), and a regrowth period (removing treatment until reaching initial PSA levels), delineated several features of the computational metastatic system: larger metastases had longer cycles; a higher proportion of drug-resistant cells slowed the cycles; and a faster cell turnover rate sped up drug response time and slowed regrowth time. The number of metastases did not affect cycle times, as response dynamics were dominated by the largest tumors rather than the aggregate. In addition, systems with higher intermetastasis heterogeneity responded better to continuous therapy and correlated with dynamics from patients with high or low Gleason scores. Conversely, systems with higher intrametastasis heterogeneity responded better to adaptive therapy and correlated with dynamics from patients with intermediate Gleason scores. Multiscale mathematical modeling combined with biomarker dynamics during adaptive therapy helps identify underlying features of metastatic cancer to inform treatment decisions.",

Furthermore, there is a paucity of real-world data on the use of ICIs in PWH and cancer. This retrospective study included PWH treated with anti-PD-1- or anti-PD-L1-based therapies for advanced cancers. Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). Objective response rates (ORRs) were measured per RECIST 1.1 or other tumor-specific criteria, whenever feasible. Restricted mean survival time (RMST) was used to compare OS and PFS between matched PWH and PWOH with metastatic NSCLC (mNSCLC). Among 390 PWH, median age was 58 years, 85% (n = 331) were males, 36% (n = 138) were Black; 70% (n = 274) received anti-PD-1/anti-PD-L1 monotherapy.

Patients with untreated, operable sinonasal tumours with selected histotypes (squamous cell carcinoma, intestinal-type adenocarcinoma, sinonasal undifferentiated and neuroendocrine carcinoma, olfactory neuroblastoma) were enrolled in a single-arm, phase II, multicenter clinical trial. Patients were treated with up to 5 ICT cycles, whose regimen was selected according to histotype, followed either by curative chemo-RT for pts with ≥80% reduction of initial tumour diameter or surgery and adjuvant (chemo)RT. Photon and/or proton/carbon ion-based RT was employed according to the disease site and stage. Primary end-point was 5-year progression-free survival (PFS), secondary end-points were overall survival (OS), ICT objective response rate (ORR) per RECIST 1.1 and safety. Thirty-five patients were evaluable for primary end-point. Fourteen patients (40%) were treated with definitive (CT)RT and 20 (57%) underwent surgery. Five-year PFS was 38% (95% confidence interval [CI], 21-69), with a median PFS of 26 months. Five-year OS was 46% (95% CI, 28-75), with a median OS of 36 months.

Local ablative therapies may augment systemic responses to immunotherapy. We evaluated circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) as a biomarker of response in patients treated on a trial combining immunotherapy with local cryotherapy for advanced STS. We enrolled 30 patients with unresectable or metastatic STS to a phase II clinical trial. Patients received ipilimumab and nivolumab for four doses followed by nivolumab alone with cryoablation performed between cycles 1 and 2. The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR) by 14 weeks. Personalized ctDNA analysis using bespoke panels was performed on blood samples collected prior to each immunotherapy cycle. ctDNA was detected in at least one sample for 96% of patients. Pretreatment ctDNA allele fraction was negatively associated with treatment response, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). ctDNA increased in 90% of patients from pretreatment to postcryotherapy, and patients with a subsequent decrease in ctDNA or undetectable ctDNA after cryotherapy had significantly better PFS. Of the 27 evaluable patients, the ORR was 4% by RECIST and 11% by irRECIST. Median PFS and OS were 2.7 and 12.0 months, respectively. No new safety signals were observed. ctDNA represents a promising biomarker for monitoring response to treatment in patients with advanced STS, warranting future prospective studies.

    "abstract": "The study investigated tumor burden dynamics on computed tomography (CT) scans in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) during first-line pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy, to provide imaging markers for overall survival (OS). The study included 133 patients treated with first-line pembrolizumab plus platinum-doublet chemotherapy. Serial CT scans during therapy were assessed for tumor burden dynamics during therapy, which were studied for the association with OS. There were 67 responders, with overall response rate of 50%. The tumor burden change at the best overall response ranged from - 100.0% to + 132.1% (median of - 30%). Higher response rates were associated with younger age (p < 0.001) and higher programmed cell death-1 (PD-L1) expression levels (p = 0.01). Eighty-three patients (62%) showed tumor burden below the baseline burden throughout therapy. Using an 8-week landmark analysis, OS was longer in patients with tumor burden below the baseline burden in the first 8 weeks than in those who experienced ≥ 0% increase (median OS: 26.8 vs. 7.6 months, hazard ratio (HR): 0.36, p < 0.001). Tumor burden remained below their baseline throughout therapy was associated with significantly reduced hazards of death (HR: 0.72, p = 0.03) in the extended Cox models, after adjusting for other clinical variables. Pseudoprogression was noted in only one patient (0.8%). Tumor burden staying below the baseline burden throughout the therapy was predictive of prolonged overall survival in patients with advanced NSCLC treated with first-line pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy, and may be used as a practical marker for therapeutic decisions in this widely used combination regimen. The analysis of tumor burden dynamics on serial CT scans in reference to the baseline burden can provide an additional objective guide for treatment decision making in patients treated with first-line pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy for their advanced NSCLC. • Tumor burden remaining below baseline burden during therapy predicted longer survival during first-line pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy. • Pseudoprogression was noted in 0.8%, demonstrating the rarity of the phenomenon. • Tumor burden dynamics may serve as an objective marker for treatment benefit to guide treatment decisions during first-line pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy.",

    "abstract": "Current surgical policy recommends comprehensive excision of tumorous calcifications in breast cancer patients following neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) regardless of MRI outcomes, despite MRI defining tumor response superior to mammography. The current study examines MRI prediction of response in tumors with vs without calcifications, using post-NAC surgical pathology as the standard of reference. Retrospective analysis of 114 NAC patients between 2011 and 2018 including demographics, mammography, 3 T-MRI, and pathology compared two sub-groups: without (n = 62) or with (n = 52) mammographic calcifications. In the calcification cohort, the mammographic extent of calcifications and MRI enhancement overlapped. MRI prediction of response to NAC was correlated with pathology. Two-tailed paired T and Fisher's exact tests and Cohen's kappa coefficient were applied for analysis. There was no significant difference between the two sub-groups regarding demographics. Tumors demonstrated equivalent features regarding size, lymph node involvement, and DCIS component. ER-negative/HER2-positive tumors more commonly exhibited calcifications (33% n = 17 calcified vs 13% n = 8 non-calcified; p < 0.05); triple negative pathology rarely calcified (6% n = 3 calcified vs 33% n = 20 non-calcified; p < 0.05). NME was more common with calcifications (62% n = 32 calcified vs 29% n = 18 non-calcified; p < 0.05) and mass enhancement without (90% n = 56 non-calcified vs 81% n = 42 calcified; p < 0.05). Both groups responded similarly to NAC (pCR = 37% non-calcified vs 38% calcified); response on MRI equally correlated with pathology (69% both subgroups; p = 0.988). We propose utilizing post-NAC MRI findings rather than mammography in planning surgery, as MRI prediction is independent of the presence or absence of calcifications. Prospective studies to evaluate this approach are warranted. • No difference was found in demographic, clinical, pathology, or imaging characteristics between patients with or without tumoral calcifications on mammography prior to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. • Residual mammographic calcifications are inadequate predictors of residual invasive disease. MRI accurately recognized complete response and correctly correlated with post-treatment surgical pathology in 69% of patients, regardless of the presence or absence of mammographic calcifications. • We propose utilizing post-NAC MRI findings rather than mammography in planning post-NAC surgery, as MRI prediction of response is independent of the presence or absence of calcifications.",

We reviewed 78 pathologically proven MIBC patients who underwent MMT including transurethral resection and chemoradiotherapy, followed by partial or radical cystectomy. Treatment response was assessed through histologic evaluation of cystectomy specimens. Two radiologists categorized the index lesions of pretherapeutic MRI according to the 5-point VI-RADS score. The associations of VI-RADS score with the therapeutic effect of MMT were analyzed. The diagnostic performance of VI-RADS scores with a cut-off VI-RADS scores  ≤ 2 or ≤ 3 for predicting pathologic complete response to MMT (MMT-CR) was evaluated. MMT-CR was achieved in 2 (100%) of VI-RADS score 1 (n = 2), 16 (84%) of score 2 (n = 19), 12 (86%) of score 3 (n = 14), 7 (64%) of score 4 (n = 11), and 14 (44%) of score 5 (n = 32). VI-RADS score was inversely associated with the incidence of MMT-CR (p = 0.00049). The cut-off VI-RADS score  ≤ 2 and  ≤ 3 could predict the favorable therapeutic outcome of MMT with high specificity (0.89 with 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.71-0.98 and 0.82 with 95% CI: 0.62-0.94, respectively) and high positive predictive value (0.86 with 95% CI: 0.64-0.97 and 0.86 with 95% CI: 0.70-0.95, respectively). VI-RADS score may serve as an imaging marker in MIBC patients for predicting the therapeutic outcome of MMT. Muscle-invasive bladder cancer patients with a lower Vesical Imaging-Reporting and Data System score can be a good candidate for bladder-sparing treatment incorporating multimodal treatment. • Vesical Imaging-Reporting and Data System (VI-RADS) score was potentially valuable for classifying pathologic tumor response in patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer. • The likelihood of achieving complete response of multimodal treatment (MMT) decreased with increasing VI-RADS score. • VI-RADS score could serve as an imaging marker that optimizes patient selection for MMT.",

    "abstract": "Predicting checkpoint inhibitors treatment outcomes in melanoma is a relevant task, due to the unpredictable and potentially fatal toxicity and high costs for society. However, accurate biomarkers for treatment outcomes are lacking. Radiomics are a technique to quantitatively capture tumour characteristics on readily available computed tomography (CT) imaging. The purpose of this study was to investigate the added value of radiomics for predicting clinical benefit from checkpoint inhibitors in melanoma in a large, multicenter cohort. Patients who received first-line anti-PD1±anti-CTLA4 treatment for advanced cutaneous melanoma were retrospectively identified from nine participating hospitals. For every patient, up to five representative lesions were segmented on baseline CT, and radiomics features were extracted. A machine learning pipeline was trained on the radiomics features to predict clinical benefit, defined as stable disease for more than 6 months or response per RECIST 1.1 criteria. This approach was evaluated using a leave-one-centre-out cross validation and compared to a model based on previously discovered clinical predictors. Lastly, a combination model was built on the radiomics and clinical model. A total of 620 patients were included, of which 59.2% experienced clinical benefit. The radiomics model achieved an area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.607 [95% CI, 0.562-0.652], lower than that of the clinical model (AUROC=0.646 [95% CI, 0.600-0.692]). The combination model yielded no improvement over the clinical model in terms of discrimination (AUROC=0.636 [95% CI, 0.592-0.680]) or calibration. The output of the radiomics model was significantly correlated with three out of five input variables of the clinical model (p < 0.001). The radiomics model achieved a moderate predictive value of clinical benefit, which was statistically significant. However, a radiomics approach was unable to add value to a simpler clinical model, most likely due to the overlap in predictive information learned by both models. Future research should focus on the application of deep learning, spectral CT-derived radiomics, and a multimodal approach for accurately predicting benefit to checkpoint inhibitor treatment in advanced melanoma.",

A total of 138 patients were enrolled; among them, 60 patients underwent neoadjuvant therapy. R0 resection was achieved in 103 patients (74.6%). The R0 resection rates were 88.7% (47/53), 52.4% (11/21), and 0.0% (0/4) for resectable, borderline resectable, and unresectable disease, respectively, in 78 patients who underwent upfront surgery. Meanwhile, the rates were 90.9% (20/22), 76.7% (23/30), and 25.0% (2/8) for resectable, borderline resectable, and unresectable PDAC, respectively, in patients who received neoadjuvant therapy. The area under curve of high-resolution CT in predicting R0 resection was 0.784, with sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 87.4% (90/103), 48.6% (17/35), and 77.5% (107/138), respectively. Tumor response was significantly associated with the R0 resection after neoadjuvant therapy (odds ratio [OR] = 38.99, p = 0.016). An 80-kVp thin-section pancreatic CT has excellent diagnostic performance in assessing PDAC resectability, enabling R0 resection rates of 88.7% and 90.9% for patients with resectable PDAC who underwent upfront surgery and patients with resectable PDAC after neoadjuvant therapy, respectively. • The margin-negative (R0) resection rates were 88.7% (47/53), 52.4% (11/21), and 0.0% (0/4) for resectable, borderline resectable, and unresectable pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), respectively, on 80-kVp thin-section pancreatic CT in the 78 patients who underwent upfront surgery. • Among the 60 patients who underwent neoadjuvant therapy, the R0 rates were 90.9% (20/22), 76.7% (23/30), and 25.0% (2/8) for resectable, borderline resectable, and unresectable PDAC, respectively. • Tumor response, along with the resectability status on pancreatic CT, was significantly associated with the R0 resection rate after neoadjuvant therapy.",

    "abstract": "To investigate the predictive performance of the deep learning radiomics (DLR) model integrating pretreatment ultrasound imaging features and clinical characteristics for evaluating therapeutic response after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in patients with breast cancer. A total of 603 patients who underwent NAC were retrospectively included between January 2018 and June 2021 from three different institutions. Four different deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) were trained by pretreatment ultrasound images using annotated training dataset (n = 420) and validated in a testing cohort (n = 183). Comparing the predictive performance of these models, the best one was selected for image-only model structure. Furthermore, the integrated DLR model was constructed based on the image-only model combined with independent clinical-pathologic variables. Areas under the curve (AUCs) of these models and two radiologists were compared by using the DeLong method. As the optimal basic model, Resnet50 achieved an AUC and accuracy of 0.879 and 82.5% in the validation set. The integrated DLR model, yielding the highest classification performance in predicting response to NAC (AUC 0.962 and 0.939 in the training and validation cohort), outperformed the image-only model and the clinical model and also performed better than two radiologists' prediction (all p < 0.05). In addition, predictive efficacy of the radiologists was improved under the assistance of the DLR model significantly. The pretreatment US-based DLR model could hold promise as a clinical guidance for predicting NAC response of patients with breast cancer, thereby providing benefit of timely treatment strategy adjustment to potential poor NAC responders. • Multicenter retrospective study showed that deep learning radiomics (DLR) model based on pretreatment ultrasound image and clinical parameter achieved satisfactory prediction of tumor response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in breast cancer. • The integrated DLR model could become an effective tool to guide clinicians in identifying potential poor pathological responders before chemotherapy. • The predictive efficacy of the radiologists was improved under the assistance of the DLR model.",

This study combined epacadostat with pembrolizumab, which has modest activity in select sarcoma subtypes. This phase II study enrolled patients with advanced sarcoma into five cohorts including (i) undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (UPS)/myxofibrosarcoma, (ii) liposarcoma (LPS), (iii) leiomyosarcoma (LMS), (iv) vascular sarcoma, including angiosarcoma and epithelioid hemangioendothelioma (EHE), and (v) other subtypes. Patients received epacadostat 100 mg twice daily plus pembrolizumab at 200 mg/dose every 3 weeks. The primary endpoint was best objective response rate (ORR), defined as complete response (CR) and partial response (PR), at 24 weeks by RECIST v.1.1. Thirty patients were enrolled [60% male; median age 54 years (range, 24-78)]. The best ORR at 24 weeks was 3.3% [PR, n = 1 (leiomyosarcoma); two-sided 95% CI, 0.1%-17.2%]. The median PFS was 7.6 weeks (two-sided 95% CI, 6.9-26.7). Treatment was well tolerated. Grade 3 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 23% (n = 7) of patients. In paired pre- and post-treatment tumor samples, no association was found between treatment and PD-L1 or IDO1 tumor expression or IDO-pathway-related gene expression by RNA sequencing. No significant changes in serum tryptophan or kynurenine levels were observed after baseline. Combination epacadostat and pembrolizumab was well tolerated and showed limited antitumor activity in sarcoma. Correlative analyses suggested that inadequate IDO1 inhibition was achieved.",

    "abstract": "About half of patients with metastatic uveal melanoma present with isolated liver metastasis, in whom the median survival is 6-12 months. The few systemic treatment options available only moderately prolong survival. Isolated hepatic perfusion (IHP) with melphalan is a regional treatment option, but prospective efficacy and safety data are lacking. In this multicenter, randomized, open-label, phase III trial, patients with previously untreated isolated liver metastases from uveal melanoma were randomly assigned to receive a one-time treatment with IHP with melphalan or best alternative care (control group). The primary end point was overall survival at 24 months. Here, we report the secondary outcomes of response according to RECIST 1.1 criteria, progression-free survival (PFS), hepatic PFS (hPFS), and safety. Ninety-three patients were randomly assigned, and 87 patients were assigned to either IHP (n = 43) or a control group receiving the investigator's choice of treatment (n = 44). In the control group, 49% received chemotherapy, 39% immune checkpoint inhibitors, and 9% locoregional treatment other than IHP. In an intention-to-treat analysis, the overall response rates (ORRs) were 40% versus 4.5% in the IHP and control groups, respectively ( IHP treatment resulted in superior ORR, hPFS, and PFS compared with best alternative care in previously untreated patients with isolated liver metastases from primary uveal melanoma.",

    "abstract": "On the basis of preclinical evidence of epigenetic contribution to sensitivity and resistance to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI), we hypothesized that guadecitabine (hypomethylating agent) and atezolizumab [anti-programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1)] together would potentiate a clinical response in patients with metastatic urothelial carcinoma (UC) unresponsive to initial immune checkpoint blockade therapy. We designed a single arm phase II study (NCT03179943) with a safety run-in to identify the recommended phase II dose of the combination therapy of guadecitabine and atezolizumab. Patients with recurrent/advanced UC who had previously progressed on ICI therapy with programmed cell death protein 1 or PD-L1 targeting agents were eligible. Preplanned correlative analysis was performed to characterize peripheral immune dynamics and global DNA methylation, transcriptome, and immune infiltration dynamics of patient tumors. Safety run-in enrolled 6 patients and phase II enrolled 15 patients before the trial was closed for futility. No dose-limiting toxicity was observed. Four patients, with best response of stable disease (SD), exhibited extended tumor control (8-11 months) and survival (>14 months). Correlative analysis revealed lack of DNA demethylation in tumors after 2 cycles of treatment. Increased peripheral immune activation and immune infiltration in tumors after treatment correlated with progression-free survival and SD. Furthermore, high IL6 and IL8 levels in the patients' plasma was associated with short survival. No RECIST responses were observed after combination therapy in this trial. Although we could not detect the anticipated tumor-intrinsic effects of guadecitabine, the addition of hypomethylating agent to ICI therapy induced immune activation in a few patients, which associated with longer patient survival.",

    "abstract": "There is ongoing controversy about the recommended dose of cabazitaxel in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). This multicenter phase II open-label, randomized, parallel-group study compared 3-weekly cabazitaxel at 25 mg/m2 (conventional arm A) with cabazitaxel therapeutic drug monitoring (experimental arm B) in mCRPC. The primary objective was to improve the clinical feasibility rate (CFR), defined as the absence of grade 4 neutropenia or thrombocytopenia, any thrombocytopenia with bleeding, febrile neutropenia, severe nonhematologic toxicity, withdrawal for cabazitaxel-related toxicity, or death. A total of 60 patients had to be randomized to detect a difference in CFR of 35% (power 80%, two-sided alpha 10%). A total of 40 patients were randomized to arm A and 33 patients to arm B. CFR was 69.4% in arm A and 64.3% in arm B (P = 0.79). Week-12 PSA response was 38.5% in both arms. A radiological response by RECIST v.1.1 was seen in 3 (9.7%) patients in arm A versus 6 (23.1%) patients in arm B (P = 0.28), disease progression was higher in arm A compared with arm B (61.3% vs. 30.8%, P = 0.05). Median progression-free survival was longer in arm B compared with arm A (9.5 vs. 4.4 months; HR = 0.46; P = 0.005). Median overall survival was higher in arm B compared with arm A (16.2 vs. 7.3 months; HR = 0.33; P < 0.0001). Pharmacokinetic-guided dosing of cabazitaxel in patients with mCRPC is feasible and improves clinical outcome due to individual dose escalations in 55% of patients.",

    "abstract": "We conducted a phase II trial evaluating the efficacy of VEGFR inhibitor axitinib and PD-L1 inhibitor avelumab in patients with recurrent/metastatic adenoid cystic carcinoma (R/M ACC). Eligible patients had R/M ACC with progression within 6 months before enrollment. Treatment consisted of axitinib and avelumab. The primary end point was objective response rate (ORR) per RECIST 1.1; secondary end points included progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and toxicity. Simon's optimal two-stage design tested the null hypothesis of ORR ≤5% versus ORR ≥20% at 6 months; ≥4 responses in 29 patients would reject the null hypothesis. Forty patients enrolled from July 2019 to June 2021; 28 were evaluable for efficacy (six screen failures; six evaluable for safety only). The confirmed ORR was 18% (95% CI, 6.1 to 36.9); there was one unconfirmed partial response (PR). Two patients achieved PR after 6 months; thus, the ORR at 6 months was 14%. The median follow-up time for surviving patients was 22 months (95% CI, 16.6 to 39.1 months). The median PFS was 7.3 months (95% CI, 3.7 to 11.2 months), 6-month PFS rate was 57% (95% CI, 41 to 78), and median OS was 16.6 months (95% CI, 12.4 to not reached months). Most common treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) included fatigue (62%), hypertension (32%), and diarrhea (32%). Ten (29%) patients had serious TRAEs, all grade 3; four patients (12%) discontinued avelumab, and nine patients (26%) underwent axitinib dose reduction. The study reached its primary end point with ≥4 PRs in 28 evaluable patients (confirmed ORR of 18%). The potential added benefit of avelumab to axitinib in ACC requires further investigation.",

    "abstract": "Aurora A kinase (AURKA) activation, related in part to AURKA amplification and variants, is associated with downregulation of estrogen receptor (ER) α expression, endocrine resistance, and implicated in cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitor (CDK 4/6i) resistance. Alisertib, a selective AURKA inhibitor, upregulates ERα and restores endocrine sensitivity in preclinical metastatic breast cancer (MBC) models. The safety and preliminary efficacy of alisertib was demonstrated in early-phase trials; however, its activity in CDK 4/6i-resistant MBC is unknown. To assess the effect of adding fulvestrant to alisertib on objective tumor response rates (ORRs) in endocrine-resistant MBC. This phase 2 randomized clinical trial was conducted through the Translational Breast Cancer Research Consortium, which enrolled participants from July 2017 to November 2019. Postmenopausal women with endocrine-resistant, ERBB2 (formerly HER2)-negative MBC who were previously treated with fulvestrant were eligible. Stratification factors included prior treatment with CDK 4/6i, baseline metastatic tumor ERα level measurement (<10%, ≥10%), and primary or secondary endocrine resistance. Among 114 preregistered patients, 96 (84.2%) registered and 91 (79.8%) were evaluable for the primary end point. Data analysis began after January 10, 2022.

Improvement in ORR in arm 2 of at least 20% greater than arm 1 when the expected ORR for arm 1 was 20%. All 91 evaluable patients (mean [SD] age, 58.5 [11.3] years; 1 American Indian/Alaskan Native [1.1%], 2 Asian [2.2%], 6 Black/African American [6.6%], 5 Hispanic [5.5%], and 79 [86.8%] White individuals; arm 1, 46 [50.5%]; arm 2, 45 [49.5%]) had received prior treatment with CDK 4/6i. The ORR was 19.6%; (90% CI, 10.6%-31.7%) for arm 1 and 20.0% (90% CI, 10.9%-32.3%) for arm 2. In arm 1, the 24-week clinical benefit rate and median progression-free survival time were 41.3% (90% CI, 29.0%-54.5%) and 5.6 months (95% CI, 3.9-10.0), respectively, and in arm 2 they were 28.9% (90% CI, 18.0%-42.0%) and 5.4 months (95% CI, 3.9-7.8), respectively. The most common grade 3 or higher adverse events attributed to alisertib were neutropenia (41.8%) and anemia (13.2%). Reasons for discontinuing treatment were disease progression (arm 1, 38 [82.6%]; arm 2, 31 [68.9%]) and toxic effects or refusal (arm 1, 5 [10.9%]; arm 2, 12 [26.7%]). This randomized clinical trial found that adding fulvestrant to treatment with alisertib did not increase ORR or PFS; however, promising clinical activity was observed with alisertib monotherapy among patients with endocrine-resistant and CDK 4/6i-resistant MBC.

In this Article, we report patient-reported outcomes (PROs) from KEYNOTE-826. KEYNOTE-826 is a multicentre, randomised, phase 3 trial in 151 cancer treatment centres in 19 countries. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older with persistent, recurrent, or metastatic cervical cancer not previously treated with systemic chemotherapy (previous radiosensitising chemotherapy was allowed) and not amenable to curative treatment and had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) centrally by means of an interactive voice response system in a double-blind manner to receive either pembrolizumab 200 mg or placebo every 3 weeks intravenously for up to 35 cycles plus chemotherapy (paclitaxel 175 mg/m Between Nov 20, 2018, and Jan 31, 2020, of 883 patients screened, 617 were randomly assigned (pembrolizumab group, n=308; placebo group, n=309). 587 (95%) of 617 patients received at least one dose of study treatment and completed at least one post-baseline PRO assessment and were therefore included in the PRO analyses (pembrolizumab group, n=290; placebo group, n=297). Median follow-up was 22·0 months (IQR 19·1-24·4). At week 30, QLQ-C30 completion was 199 (69%) of 290 patients in the pembrolizumab group and 168 (57%) of 297 patients in the placebo group; compliance was 199 (94%) of 211 and 168 (90%) of 186, respectively. The least squares mean change in QLQ-C30 GHS-QoL score from baseline to week 30 was -0·3 points (95% CI -3·1 to 2·6) in the pembrolizumab group and -1·3 points (-4·2 to 1·7) in the placebo group, with a between-group difference in least squares mean change of 1·0 point (95% CI -2·7 to 4·7). Median time to true deterioration in GHS-QoL was not reached (NR; 95% CI 13·4 months-NR) in the pembrolizumab group and 12·9 months (6·6-NR) in the placebo group (hazard ratio 0·84 [95% CI 0·65-1·09]). 122 (42%) of 290 patients in the pembrolizumab group versus 85 (29%) of 297 in the placebo group had improved GHS-QoL at any time during the study (p=0·0003). Addition of pembrolizumab to chemotherapy with or without bevacizumab did not negatively affect health-related quality of life. Along with the efficacy and safety results already reported from KEYNOTE-826, these data support the benefit of pembrolizumab and the value of immunotherapy in patients with recurrent, persistent, or metastatic cervical cancer.

Median progression-free survival was 23·3 months (95% CI 20·8-27·7) in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab group and 9·2 months (6·0-11·0) in the sunitinib group (stratified hazard ratio [HR] 0·42 [95% CI 0·34-0·52]). Median overall survival follow-up was 33·7 months (IQR 27·4-36·9) in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab group and 33·4 months (26·7-36·8) in the sunitinib group. Overall survival was improved with lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab (median not reached [95% CI 41·5-not estimable]) versus sunitinib (median not reached [38·4-not estimable]; HR 0·72 [95% CI 0·55-0·93]). Efficacy benefits of lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab over sunitinib were durable and clinically meaningful with extended follow-up. These results support the use of lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab as a first-line therapy for patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma. Eisai and Merck Sharp & Dohme.",

    "abstract": "Cyclin D/CDK4/6 is critical in controlling the G1 to S checkpoint. CCND, the gene encoding cyclin D, is known to be amplified in a variety of solid tumors. Palbociclib is an oral CDK4/6 inhibitor, approved in advanced breast cancer in combination with endocrine therapy. We explored the efficacy of palbociclib in patients with nonbreast solid tumors containing an amplification in CCND1, 2, or 3. Patients with tumors containing a CCND1, 2, or 3 amplification and expression of the retinoblastoma protein were assigned to subprotocol Z1B and received palbociclib 125 mg once daily for 21 days of a 28-day cycle. Tumor response was assessed every two cycles. Forty patients were assigned to subprotocol Z1B; 4 patients had outside assays identifying the CCND1, 2, or 3 amplification and were not confirmed centrally; 3 were ineligible and 2 were not treated (1 untreated patient was also ineligible), leaving 32 evaluable patients for this analysis. There were no partial responses; 12 patients (37.5%) had stable disease as best response. There were seven deaths on study, all during cycle 1 and attributable to disease progression. Median progression-free survival was 1.8 months. The most common toxicities were leukopenia (n = 21, 55%) and neutropenia (n = 19, 50%); neutropenia was the most common grade 3/4 event (n = 12, 32%). Palbociclib was not effective at treating nonbreast solid tumors with a CCND1, 2, or 3 amplification in this cohort. These data do not support further investigation of single-agent palbociclib in tumors with CCND1, 2, or 3 amplification.",

    "abstract": "The efficacy of cetuximab is poor in metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Cetuximab initiates natural killer (NK) cell-mediated antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, with resultant recruitment of immune cells and suppression of antitumor immunity. We hypothesized that adding an immune-checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) could overcome this and lead to an enhanced antitumor response. A phase II study of cetuximab and durvalumab in metastatic HNSCC was conducted. Eligible patients had measurable disease. Patients who had received both cetuximab and an ICI were excluded. The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR) by RECIST 1.1 at 6 months. As of April 2022, 35 patients enrolled, of whom 33 received at least 1 dose of durvalumab and were included in the response analysis. Eleven patients (33%) had received prior platinum-based chemotherapy, 10 an ICI (30%), and 1 patient (3%) cetuximab. ORR was 39% (13/33) with a median duration of response of 8.6 months [95% confidence interval (CI): 6.5-16.8]. Median progression-free and overall survivals were 5.8 months (95% CI: 3.7-14.1) and 9.6 months (95% CI: 4.8-16.3), respectively. There were 16 grade 3 treatment-related adverse events (TRAE) and one grade 4 TRAE, with no treatment-related deaths. Overall and progression-free survival did not correlate with PD-L1 status. NK cell cytotoxic activity was increased by cetuximab and further increased with the addition of durvalumab in responders. The combination of cetuximab and durvalumab demonstrated durable activity with a tolerable safety profile in metastatic HNSCC and warrants further investigation.",

    "abstract": "Previous reports showed limited efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors as single-agent treatment for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation or ALK/ROS1 fusion. We aimed at evaluating the efficacy and safety of immune checkpoint inhibitor combined with chemotherapy and bevacizumab (when eligible) in this patient subgroup. We conducted a French national open-label multicentre non-randomised non-comparative phase II study in patients with stage IIIB/IV NSCLC, oncogenic addiction (EGFR mutation or ALK/ROS1 fusion), with disease progression after tyrosine kinase inhibitor and no prior chemotherapy. Patients received platinum, pemetrexed, atezolizumab, bevacizumab (PPAB cohort) or, if not eligible to bevacizumab, platinum-pemetrexed-atezolizumab (PPA cohort). The primary end-point was the objective response rate (RECIST v1.1) after 12 weeks, evaluated by blind independent central review. 71 patients were included in PPAB cohort and 78 in PPA cohort (mean age, 60.4/66.1 years; women 69.0%/51.3%; EGFR mutation, 87.3%/89.7%; ALK rearrangement, 12.7%/5.1%; ROS1 fusion, 0%/6.4%, respectively). After 12 weeks, objective response rate was 58.2% (90% confidence interval [CI], 47.4-68.4) in PPAB cohort and 46.5% (90% CI, 36.3-56.9) in PPA cohort. Median progression-free survival and overall survival were 7.3 (95% CI 6.9-9.0) months and 17.2 (95% CI 13.7-NA) months in PPAB cohort and 7.2 (95% CI 5.7-9.2) months and 16.8 (95% CI 13.5-NA) months in PPA cohort, respectively. Grade 3-4 adverse events occurred in 69.1% of patients in PPAB cohort and 51.4% in PPA cohort; Grade 3-4 atezolizumab-related adverse events occurred in 27.9% and 15.3%, respectively.

The feasibility of a second maintenance course of PARPi was unknown. Phase II trial with two entry points (EP1, EP2). Patients were recruited prior to rechallenge platinum. Patients with relapsed, gBRCAm-HGSOC were enrolled at EP1 if they were PARPi-naïve. Patients enrolled at EP2 had received their first course of olaparib prior to trial entry. EP1 patients were retreated with olaparib after RECIST complete/partial response (CR/PR) to platinum. EP2 patients were retreated with olaparib ± cediranib after RECIST CR/PR/stable disease to platinum and according to the platinum-free interval. Co-primary outcomes were the proportion of patients who received a second course of olaparib and the proportion who received olaparib retreatment for ≥6 months. Functional homologous recombination deficiency (HRD), somatic copy-number alteration (SCNA), and BRCAm reversions were investigated in tumor and liquid biopsies. Twenty-seven patients were treated (EP1 = 17, EP2 = 10), and 19 were evaluable. Twelve patients (63%) received a second course of olaparib and 4 received olaparib retreatment for ≥6 months. Common grade ≥2 adverse events during olaparib retreatment were anemia, nausea, and fatigue. No cases of MDS/AML occurred. Mean duration of olaparib treatment and retreatment differed (12.1 months vs. 4.4 months; P < 0.001). Functional HRD and SCNA did not predict PFS. A BRCA2 reversion mutation was detected in a post-olaparib liquid biopsy. A second course of olaparib can be safely administered to women with gBRCAm-HGSOC but is only modestly efficacious.

    "abstract": "We aimed to construct machine learning (ML) radiomics models to predict response to lenvatinib monotherapy for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Patients with HCC receiving lenvatinib monotherapy at three institutions were retrospectively identified and assigned to training and external validation cohorts. Tumor response after initiation of lenvatinib was evaluated. Radiomics features were extracted from contrast-enhanced CT images. The K-means clustering algorithm was used to distinguish radiomics-based subtypes. Ten ML radiomics models were constructed and internally validated by 10-fold cross-validation. These models were subsequently verified in an external validation cohort. A total of 109 patients were identified for analysis, namely, 74 in the training cohort and 35 in the external validation cohort. Thirty-two patients showed partial response, 33 showed stable disease, and 44 showed progressive disease. The overall response rate (ORR) was 29.4%, and the disease control rate was 59.6%. A total of 224 radiomics features were extracted, and 25 significant features were identified for further analysis. Two distant radiomics-based subtypes were identified by K-means clustering, and subtype 1 was associated with a higher ORR and longer progression-free survival (PFS). Among the 10 ML algorithms, AutoGluon displayed the highest predictive performance (AUC = 0.97), which was relatively stable in the validation cohort (AUC = 0.93). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that responders had a better overall survival [HR = 0.21; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.12-0.36; P < 0.001] and PFS (HR = 0.14; 95% CI: 0.09-0.22; P < 0.001) than nonresponders. Valuable ML radiomics models were constructed, with favorable performance in predicting the response to lenvatinib monotherapy for unresectable HCC.",

Vigil is a novel autologous tumor cell therapy expressing bi-shRNA furin/GMCSF plasmid, which previously demonstrated monotherapy activity in advanced ES. Herein we report safety and evidence of benefit to Vigil for ES as potential treatment. In this pilot trial, eligible patients with recurrent or refractory ES who failed initial standard-of-care therapy received treatment with temozolomide (TEM) 100 mg/m2/day oral and irinotecan (IRI) 50 mg/m2/day oral, Days 1 to 5, in combination with Vigil (1 × 106-107 cells/mL/day intradermal, Day 15), every 21 days (Vigil/TEM/IRI).

We aimed to identify genomic and transcriptomic factors associated with structural responses to RAI treatment of metastatic thyroid cancer, which occur infrequently, and to test whether high MAPK pathway output was associated with RAI refractoriness. Exceptional response to RAI was defined as reduction of tumor volume based on RECIST v1.1. We performed a retrospective case-control study of genomic and transcriptomic characteristics of exceptional responders (ER; n = 8) versus nonresponders (NR; n = 16) matched by histologic type and stage at presentation on a 1:2 ratio. ER are enriched for mutations that activate MAPK through RAF dimerization (RAS, class 2 BRAF, RTK fusions), whereas NR are associated with BRAFV600E, which signals as a monomer and is unresponsive to negative feedback. ER have a lower MAPK transcriptional output and a higher thyroid differentiation score (TDS) than NR (P < 0.05). NR are enriched for 1q-gain (P < 0.05) and mutations of genes regulating mRNA splicing and the PI3K pathway. BRAFV600E tumors with 1q-gain have a lower TDS than BRAFV600E/1q-quiet tumors and transcriptomic signatures associated with metastatic propensity. ER tumors have a lower MAPK output and higher TDS than NR, whereas NR have a high frequency of BRAFV600E and 1q-gain. Molecular profiling of thyroid cancers and further functional validation of the key findings discriminating ER from NR may help predict response to RAI therapy.",

    "abstract": "The objective of the study is to propose the immunotherapy progression decision (iPD) score, a practical tool based on patient features that are available at the first evaluation of immunotherapy treatment, to help oncologists decide whether to continue the treatment or switch rapidly to another therapeutic line when facing a progressive disease patient at the first evaluation. This retrospective study included 107 patients with progressive disease at first evaluation according to RECIST 1.1. Clinical, radiological, and biological data at baseline and first evaluation were analyzed. An external validation set consisting of 31 patients with similar baseline characteristics was used for the validation of the score. Variables were analyzed in a univariate study. The iPD score was constructed using only independent variables, each considered as a worsening factor for the survival of patients. The patients were stratified in three groups: good prognosis (GP), poor prognosis (PP), and critical prognosis (CP). Each group showed significantly different survivals (GP: 11.4, PP: 4.4, CP: 2.3 months median overall survival, P < 0.001, log-rank test). Moreover, the iPD score was able to detect the pseudoprogressors better than other scores. On the validation set, CP patients had significantly worse survival than PP and GP patients (P < 0.05, log-rank test). The iPD score provides oncologists with a new evaluation, computable at first progression, to decide whether treatment should be continued (for the GP group), or immediately changed for the PP and CP groups. Further validation on larger cohorts is needed to prove its efficacy in clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) is an aggressive malignancy with limited treatments. Delta-like ligand 3 (DLL3) is aberrantly expressed in most SCLC. Tarlatamab (AMG 757), a bispecific T-cell engager molecule, binds both DLL3 and CD3 leading to T-cellb-mediated tumor lysis. Herein, we report phase I results of tarlatamab in patients with SCLC. This study evaluated tarlatamab in patients with relapsed/refractory SCLC. The primary end point was safety. Secondary end points included antitumor activity by modified RECIST 1.1, overall survival, and pharmacokinetics. By July 19, 2022, 107 patients received tarlatamab in dose exploration (0.003 to 100 mg; n = 73) and expansion (100 mg; n = 34) cohorts. Median prior lines of anticancer therapy were 2 (range, 1-6); 49.5% received antiprogrammed death-1/programmed death ligand-1 therapy. Any-grade treatment-related adverse events occurred in 97 patients (90.7%) and grade b % 3 in 33 patients (30.8%). One patient (1%) had grade 5 pneumonitis. Cytokine release syndrome was the most common treatment-related adverse event, occurring in 56 patients (52%) including grade 3 in one patient (1%). Maximum tolerated dose was not reached. Objective response rate was 23.4% (95% CI, 15.7 to 32.5) including two complete and 23 partial responses. The median duration of response was 12.3 months (95% CI, 6.6 to 14.9). The disease control rate was 51.4% (95% CI, 41.5 to 61.2). The median progression-free survival and overall survival were 3.7 months (95% CI, 2.1 to 5.4) and 13.2 months (95% CI, 10.5 to not reached), respectively. Exploratory analysis suggests that selecting for increased DLL3 expression can result in increased clinical benefit. In patients with heavily pretreated SCLC, tarlatamab demonstrated manageable safety with encouraging response durability. Further evaluation of this promising molecule is ongoing.",

In this first-in-human phase I study, patients with advanced solid tumors or lymphomas received milademetan orally once daily as extended/continuous (days 1-21 or 1-28 every 28 days) or intermittent (days 1-7, or days 1-3 and 15-17 every 28 days) schedules. The primary objective was to determine the recommended phase II dose and schedule. Secondary objectives included tumor response according to standard evaluation criteria. Predefined analyses by tumor type were performed. Safety and efficacy analyses included all patients who received milademetan. Between July 2013 and August 2018, 107 patients were enrolled and received milademetan. The most common grade 3/4 drug-related adverse events were thrombocytopenia (29.0%), neutropenia (15.0%), and anemia (13.1%). Respective rates at the recommended dose and schedule (260 mg once daily on days 1-3 and 15-17 every 28 days, ie, 3/14 days) were 15.0%, 5.0%, and 0%. Across all cohorts (N = 107), the disease control rate was 45.8% (95% CI, 36.1 to 55.7) and median progression-free survival was 4.0 months (95% CI, 3.4 to 5.7).

An intermittent dosing schedule of 3/14 days of milademetan mitigates dose-limiting hematologic abnormalities while maintaining efficacy. Notable single-agent activity with milademetan in dedifferentiated liposarcomas has prompted a randomized phase III trial (MANTRA).",

    "abstract": "Model-based tumor growth inhibition (TGI) metrics are increasingly incorporated into go/no-go decisions in early clinical studies. To apply this methodology to new investigational combinations requires independent evaluation of TGI metrics in recently completed Phase III trials of effective immunotherapy. Data were extracted from IMpower150, a positive, randomized, Phase III study of first-line therapy in 1,202 patients with non-small cell lung cancer. We resampled baseline characteristics and longitudinal sum of longest diameters of tumor lesions of patients from both arms, atezolizumab+ bevacizumab+chemotherapy (ABCP) versus BCP, to mimic Phase Ib/II studies of 15 to 40 patients/arm with 6 to 24 weeks follow-up. TGI metrics were estimated using a bi-exponential TGI model. Effect sizes were calculated as TGI metrics geometric mean ratio (GMR), objective response rate (ORR) difference (d), and progression-free survival (PFS), hazard ratio (HR) between arms. Correct and incorrect go decisions were evaluated as the probability to achieve desired effect sizes in ABCP versus BCP and BCP versus BCP, respectively, across 500 replicated subsamples for each design. For 40 patients/24 weeks follow-up, correct go decisions based on probability tumor growth rate (KG) GMR <0.90, dORR >0.10, and PFS HR <0.70 were 83%, 69%, and 58% with incorrect go decision rates of 4%, 12%, and 11%, respectively. For other designs, the ranking did not change with TGI metrics consistently overperforming RECIST endpoints. The predicted overall survival (OS) HR was around 0.80 in most of the scenarios investigated. Model-based estimate of KG GMR is an exploratory endpoint that informs early clinical decisions for combination studies.",

The Delta_Model (AUC 0.92) had a better predictive ability than the Pre_Model (AUC 0.78) and Post_Model (AUC 0.76) and was better than AJCC staging (AUC 0.52) and RECIST 1.1 criteria (AUC 0.52). The Combined_Model (pre, post, and delta features) had the best predictive performance (AUC 0.95). Whole-tumor texture analysis of multisequence MRI can well predict pCR status after neoadjuvant RT and targeted therapy in STS patients, with better performance than RECIST 1.1 and AJCC staging. • MRI multisequence texture analysis could predict the efficacy of neoadjuvant RT and targeted therapy for STS patients. • Texture features showed incremental value beyond routine clinical factors. • The Combined_Model with features at multiple time points showed the best performance.",

    "abstract": "To compare four previously published methods for rectal tumor response evaluation after chemoradiotherapy on MRI. Twenty-two radiologists (5 rectal MRI experts, 17 general/abdominal radiologists) retrospectively reviewed the post-chemoradiotherapy MRIs of 90 patients, scanned at 10 centers (with non-standardized protocols). They applied four response methods; two based on T2W-MRI only (MRI tumor regression grade (mrTRG); split-scar sign), and two based on T2W-MRI+DWI (modified-mrTRG; DWI-patterns). Image quality was graded using a 0-6-point score (including slice thickness and in-plane resolution; sequence angulation; DWI b-values, signal-to-noise, and artefacts); scores < 4 were classified below average. Mixed model linear regression was used to calculate average sensitivity/specificity/accuracy to predict a complete response (versus residual tumor) and assess the impact of reader experience and image quality. Group interobserver agreement (IOA) was calculated using Krippendorff's alpha. Readers were asked to indicate their preferred scoring method(s). Average sensitivity/specificity/accuracy was 57%/64%/62% (mrTRG), 36%/79%/66% (split-scar), 40%/79%/67% (modified-mrTRG), and 37%/82%/68% (DWI-patterns); mrTRG showed higher sensitivity but lower specificity and accuracy (p < 0.001) compared to the other methods. IOA was lower for the split scar method (0.18 vs. 0.39-0.43). Higher reader experience had a significant positive effect on diagnostic performance and IOA (except for the split scar sign); below-average imaging quality had a significant negative effect on diagnostic performance. DWI pattern was selected as the preferred method by 73% of readers. Methods incorporating DWI showed the most favorable results when combining diagnostic performance, IOA, and reader preference. Reader experience and image quality clearly impacted diagnostic performance emphasizing the need for state-of-the-art imaging and dedicated radiologist training. • In a multireader study comparing 4 MRI methods for rectal tumor response evaluation, those incorporating DWI showed the best results when combining diagnostic performance, IOA, and reader preference. • The most preferred method (by 73% of readers) was the \"DWI patterns\" approach with an accuracy of 68%, high specificity of 82%, and group IOA of 0.43. • Reader experience level and MRI quality had an evident effect on diagnostic performance and IOA.",

This retrospective study included 61 patients with HCC who received anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibody therapy from August 1, 2020, to January 31, 2022. We compared the progression-free survival (PFS) of patients with hyper-enhanced rim+ and hyper-enhanced rim-nodules and the time to nodule progression (TTnP) of hyper-enhanced rim+ and hyper-enhanced rim- nodules. Thirty-nine patients received postoperative therapy, and 22 patients had unresectable HCC. The mean PFS was 11.8 months (95% confidence interval [CI]: 8.7-14.9) for patients with hyper-enhanced rim+ HCC nodules and 16.5 months (95% CI: 14.9-18.1) for patients with hyper-enhanced rim- HCC nodules in the surgery group (p = 0.017). The mean PFS was 9.2 months (95% CI: 3.6-14.8) for patients with hyper-enhanced rim+ HCC nodules and 17.8 months (95% CI: 14.9-20.6) for patients with hyper-enhanced rim- HCC nodules in the non-surgery group (p = 0.015). For hyper-enhanced rim+ HCC nodules, TTnP for each nodule exceeding the specified threshold was 10.1 months, whereas that for hyper-enhanced rim- HCC nodules was 17.6 months (p = 0 .018).

This phase I study evaluated the safety, efficacy, and pharmocodynamics of androgen deprivation with the gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist triptorelin combined with nivolumab in male patients with melanoma resistant to anti-PD-1. Adult male patients with advanced melanoma who progressed under anti-PD-1 containing regimens received triptorelin 3.75 mg every 4 weeks, nivolumab 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks, and bicalutamide 50 mg once daily during the first 28 days. Tumor response was first assessed after 3 months; adverse events (AE) were monitored throughout the study. T-cell receptor excision circles (TREC), a biomarker of thymus activity, were explored throughout the study. Of 14 patients, 4 were locally advanced and 10 had distant metastases. There were no grade 4 or 5 AEs. Five grade three AEs were reported in 4 patients. According to RECIST v1.1, best overall response was partial response (PR) in one patient with a pancreas metastasis, stable disease (SD) in 5 patients, and progressive disease in 8 patients. According to iRECIST, a second PR occurred after an initial pseudoprogression, TRECs increased in 2 patients, one with PR who also had an increase in TILs, and the second with SD.

Long-term follow-up is necessary to confirm durability of response and identify further safety concerns. In KEYNOTE-045, patients with metastatic UC that progressed on platinum-containing chemotherapy were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive pembrolizumab or investigator's choice of paclitaxel, docetaxel, or vinflunine. Primary endpoints were progression-free survival per RECIST version 1.1 by blinded independent central review (BICR) and overall survival. In KEYNOTE-052, cisplatin-ineligible patients with metastatic UC received first-line pembrolizumab. The primary endpoint was objective response rate per RECIST version 1.1 by BICR. A total of 542 patients (pembrolizumab, n = 270; chemotherapy, n = 272) were randomly assigned in KEYNOTE-045. The median follow-up was 62.9 months (range 58.6-70.9 months; data cut-off 1 October 2020). At 48 months, overall survival rates were 16.7% for pembrolizumab and 10.1% for chemotherapy; progression-free survival rates were 9.5% and 2.7%, respectively. The median duration of response (DOR) was 29.7 months (range 1.6+ to 60.5+ months) for pembrolizumab and 4.4 months (range 1.4+ to 63.1+ months) for chemotherapy; 36-month DOR rates were 44.4% and 28.3%, respectively.

    "abstract": "PARP inhibitors have become the standard-of-care treatment for homologous recombination deficient (HRD) high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC). However, not all HRD tumors respond to PARPi. Biomarkers to predict response are needed. [18F]FluorThanatrace ([18F]FTT) is a PARPi-analog PET radiotracer that noninvasively measures PARP-1 expression. Herein, we evaluate [18F]FTT as a biomarker to predict response to PARPi in patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models and subjects with HRD HGSOC. In PDX models, [18F]FTT-PET was performed before and after PARPi (olaparib), ataxia-telangiectasia inhibitor (ATRi), or both (PARPi-ATRi). Changes in [18F]FTT were correlated with tumor volume changes. Subjects were imaged with [18F]FTT-PET at baseline and after ∼1 week of PARPi. Changes in [18F]FTT-PET uptake were compared with changes in tumor size (RECISTv1.1), CA-125, and progression-free survival (PFS). A decrease in [18F]FTT tumor uptake after PARPi correlated with response to PARPi, or PARPi-ATRi treatment in PARPi-resistant PDX models (r = 0.77-0.81). In subjects (n = 11), percent difference in [18F]FTT-PET after ∼7 days of PARPi compared with baseline correlated with best RECIST response (P = 0.01), best CA-125 response (P = 0.033), and PFS (P = 0.027). All subjects with >50% reduction in [18F]FTT uptake had >6-month PFS and >50% reduction in CA-125. Utilizing only baseline [18F]FTT uptake did not predict such responses. The decline in [18F]FTT uptake shortly after PARPi initiation provides a measure of drug-target engagement and shows promise as a biomarker to guide PARPi therapies in this pilot study. These results support additional preclinical mechanistic and clinical studies in subjects receiving PARPi ± combination therapy. See related commentary by Liu and Zamarin, p. 1384.",

    "abstract": "In patients with RAS wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer, depth of response (DpR) has gained importance as a novel end-point in clinical trials. We investigated the overall DpR, as well as the prognostic and predictive impact of DpR to induction therapy (six cycles of 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin [FU/FA], oxaliplatin [FOLFOX] and panitumumab [Pmab]) on consecutive maintenance therapy (FU/FA plus Pmab or FU/FA alone) in patients treated within the PanaMa trial. Central radiological assessment was performed according to RECIST 1.1. DpR was defined as percentage change in tumour diameter within defined time intervals (induction therapy, maintenance therapy, total course of therapy). For prognostic and predictive analyses, median DpR (</≥) served as threshold. Out of 248 patients receiving maintenance therapy, 211 were evaluable for DpR analyses (FU/FA + Pmab, n = 106; FU/FA alone, n = 105). The overall DpR in all patients was 56.5%. DpR of induction therapy (42.5%) accounted for the largest proportion (75.2%) of the overall DpR. While greater DpR to induction therapy was significantly associated with prolonged PFS (HR 0.70, 95% CI 0.52-0.93, p = 0.013) and OS (HR 0.38, 95% CI 0.28-0.51, p < 0.001), there was no significant correlation of DpR and maintenance treatment arm. In the PanaMa trial, the overall DpR was similar to DpR achieved by other epidermal growth factor receptor-based regimens. DpR to induction therapy accounted for three quarters of the total tumour shrinkage potentially suggesting that FOLFOX plus Pmab can be de-escalated following induction without substantially compromising efficacy. DpR to induction therapy was prognostic but not predictive for efficacy of consecutive maintenance therapy. NCT01991873.",

    "abstract": "Watchful waiting (WW) can be considered for patients with metastatic clear-cell renal cell carcinoma (mccRCC) with good or intermediate prognosis, especially those with <2 International Metastatic RCC Database Consortium criteria and ≤2 metastatic sites [referred to as watch and wait (\"W&W\") criteria]. The IMaging PAtients for Cancer drug SelecTion-Renal Cell Carcinoma study objective was to assess the predictive value of [18F]FDG PET/CT and [89Zr]Zr-DFO-girentuximab PET/CT for WW duration in patients with mccRCC. Between February 2015 and March 2018, 48 patients were enrolled, including 40 evaluable patients with good (n = 14) and intermediate (n = 26) prognosis. Baseline contrast-enhanced CT, [18F]FDG and [89Zr]Zr-DFO-girentuximab PET/CT were performed. Primary endpoint was the time to disease progression warranting systemic treatment. Maximum standardized uptake values (SUVmax) were measured using lesions on CT images coregistered to PET/CT. High and low uptake groups were defined on the basis of median geometric mean SUVmax of RECIST-measurable lesions across patients. The median WW time was 16.1 months [95% confidence interval (CI): 9.0-31.7]. The median WW period was shorter in patients with high [18F]FDG tumor uptake than those with low uptake (9.0 vs. 36.2 months; HR, 5.6; 95% CI: 2.4-14.7; P < 0.001). Patients with high [89Zr]Zr-DFO-girentuximab tumor uptake had a median WW period of 9.3 versus 21.3 months with low uptake (HR, 1.7; 95% CI: 0.9-3.3; P = 0.13). Patients with \"W&W criteria\" had a longer median WW period of 21.3 compared with patients without: 9.3 months (HR, 1.9; 95% CI: 0.9-3.9; Pone-sided = 0.034). Adding [18F]FDG uptake to the \"W&W criteria\" improved the prediction of WW duration (P < 0.001); whereas [89Zr]Zr-DFO-girentuximab did not (P = 0.53). In patients with good- or intermediate-risk mccRCC, low [18F]FDG uptake is associated with prolonged WW. This study shows the predictive value of the \"W&W criteria\" for WW duration and shows the potential of [18F]FDG-PET/CT to further improve this.",

    "abstract": "Nonclinical studies suggest that the combination of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase and programmed cell death 1/programmed cell death-ligand 1 inhibitors has enhanced antitumor activity; however, the patient populations that may benefit from this combination have not been identified. To evaluate whether the combination of avelumab and talazoparib is effective in patients with pathogenic BRCA1/2 or ATM alterations, regardless of tumor type. In this pan-cancer tumor-agnostic phase 2b nonrandomized controlled trial, patients with advanced BRCA1/2-altered or ATM-altered solid tumors were enrolled into 2 respective parallel cohorts. The study was conducted from July 2, 2018, to April 12, 2020, at 42 institutions in 9 countries. Patients received 800 mg of avelumab every 2 weeks and 1 mg of talazoparib once daily. The primary end point was confirmed objective response (OR) per RECIST 1.1 by blinded independent central review. A total of 200 patients (median [range] age, 59.0 [26.0-89.0] years; 132 [66.0%] women; 15 [7.5%] Asian, 11 [5.5%] African American, and 154 [77.0%] White participants) were enrolled: 159 (79.5%) in the BRCA1/2 cohort and 41 (20.5%) in the ATM cohort. The confirmed OR rate was 26.4% (42 patients, including 9 complete responses [5.7%]) in the BRCA1/2 cohort and 4.9% (2 patients) in the ATM cohort. In the BRCA1/2 cohort, responses were more frequent (OR rate, 30.3%; 95% CI, 22.2%-39.3%, including 8 complete responses [6.7%]) and more durable (median duration of response: 10.9 months [95% CI, 6.2 months to not estimable]) in tumor types associated with increased heritable cancer risk (ie, BRCA1/2-associated cancer types, such as ovarian, breast, prostate, and pancreatic cancers) and in uterine leiomyosarcoma (objective response in 3 of 3 patients and with ongoing responses greater than 24 months) compared with non-BRCA-associated cancer types. Responses in the BRCA1/2 cohort were numerically higher for patients with tumor mutational burden of 10 or more mutations per megabase (mut/Mb) vs less than 10 mut/Mb. The combination was well tolerated, with no new safety signals identified. In this phase 2b nonrandomized controlled trial, neither the BRCA1/2 nor ATM cohort met the prespecified OR rate of 40%. Antitumor activity for the combination of avelumab and talazoparib in patients with BRCA1/2 alterations was observed in some patients with BRCA1/2-associated tumor types and uterine leiomyosarcoma; benefit was minimal in non-BRCA-associated cancer types.

    "abstract": "To establish an effective dynamic nomogram combining magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings of primary tumor and regional lymph nodes with tumor stage for the pretreatment prediction of induction chemotherapy (IC) response in locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma (LANPC). A total of 498 LANPC patients (372 in the training and 126 in the validation cohort) with MRI information were enrolled. All patients were classified as \"favorable responders\" and \"unfavorable responders\" according to tumor response to IC. A nomogram for IC response was built based on the results of the logistic regression model. Also, the Cox regression analysis was used to identify the independent prognostic factors of disease-free survival (DFS). After two cycles of IC, 340 patients were classified as \"favorable responders\" and 158 patients as \"unfavorable responders.\" Calibration curves revealed satisfactory agreement between the predicted and the observed probabilities. The nomogram achieved an AUC of 0.855 (95% CI, 0.781-0.930) for predicting IC response, which outperformed TNM staging (AUC, 0.661; 95% CI 0.565-0.758) and the MRI feature-based model alone (AUC, 0.744; 95% CI 0.650-0.839) in the validation cohort. The nomogram was used to categorize patients into high- and low-response groups. An online dynamic model was built ( https://nomogram-for-icresponse-prediction.shinyapps.io/DynNomapp/ ) to facilitate the application of the nomogram. In the Cox multivariate analysis, clinical stage, tumor necrosis, EBV DNA levels, and cervical lymph node numbers were independently associated with DFS. The comprehensive nomogram incorporating MRI features and tumor stage could assist physicians in predicting IC response and formulating personalized treatment strategies for LANPC patients. • The nomogram can predict IC response in endemic LANPC. • The nomogram combining tumor stage with MRI-based tumor features showed very good predictive performance. • The nomogram was transformed into a web-based dynamic model to optimize clinical application.",

    "abstract": "We evaluated the activity of AZD8205, a B7-H4-directed antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) bearing a novel topoisomerase I inhibitor (TOP1i) payload, alone and in combination with the PARP1-selective inhibitor AZD5305, in preclinical models. IHC and deep-learning-based image analysis algorithms were used to assess prevalence and intratumoral heterogeneity of B7-H4 expression in human tumors. Several TOP1i-ADCs, prepared with Val-Ala or Gly-Gly-Phe-Gly peptide linkers, with or without a PEG8 spacer, were compared in biophysical, in vivo efficacy, and rat toxicology studies. AZD8205 mechanism of action and efficacy studies were conducted in human cancer cell line and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models. Evaluation of IHC-staining density on a per-cell basis revealed a range of heterogeneous B7-H4 expression across patient tumors. This informed selection of bystander-capable Val-Ala-PEG8-TOP1i payload AZ14170133 and development of AZD8205, which demonstrated improved stability, efficacy, and safety compared with other linker-payload ADCs. In a study of 26 PDX tumors, single administration of 3.5 mg/kg AZD8205 provided a 69% overall response rate, according to modified RECIST criteria, which correlated with homologous recombination repair (HRR) deficiency (HRD) and elevated levels of B7-H4 in HRR-proficient models. Addition of AZD5305 sensitized very low B7-H4-expressing tumors to AZD8205 treatment, independent of HRD status and in models representing clinically relevant mechanisms of PARPi resistance. These data provide evidence for the potential utility of AZD8205 for treatment of B7-H4-expressing tumors and support the rationale for an ongoing phase 1 clinical study (NCT05123482).

    "abstract": "Currently, guidelines for PET with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG-PET) interpretation for assessment of therapy response in oncology primarily involve visual evaluation of FDG-PET/CT scans. However, quantitative measurements of the metabolic activity in tumors may be even more useful in evaluating response to treatment. Guidelines based on such measurements, including the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Criteria and PET Response Criteria in Solid Tumors, have been proposed. However, more rigorous analysis of response criteria based on FDG-PET measurements is needed to adopt regular use in practice. Well-defined boundaries of repeatability and reproducibility of quantitative measurements to discriminate noise from true signal changes are a needed initial step. An extension of the meta-analysis from de Langen and colleagues (2012) of the test-retest repeatability of quantitative FDG-PET measurements, including mean, maximum, and peak standardized uptake values (SUVmax, SUVmean, and SUVpeak, respectively), was performed. Data from 11 studies in the literature were used to estimate the relationship between the variance in test-retest measurements with uptake level and various study-level, patient-level, and lesion-level characteristics. Test-retest repeatability of percentage fluctuations for all three types of SUV measurement (max, mean, and peak) improved with higher FDG uptake levels. Repeatability in all three SUV measurements varied for different lesion locations. Worse repeatability in SUVmean was also associated with higher tumor volumes. On the basis of these results, recommendations regarding SUV measurements for assessing minimal detectable changes based on repeatability and reproducibility are proposed. These should be applied to differentiate between response categories for a future set of FDG-PET-based criteria that assess clinically significant changes in tumor response.",

We present the results for a phase II trial of combination nivolumab and temozolomide in patients with advanced NEN along with results of immune changes in peripheral blood. NCT03728361 is a nonrandomized, phase II study of nivolumab and temozolomide in patients with NEN. The primary endpoint was response rate using RECIST 1.1. Secondary endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and safety. Immune profiling was performed by mass cytometry to evaluate the effect on peripheral blood immune cell subsets. Among all 28 patients with NEN, the confirmed response rate was 9/28 [32.1%, 95% confidence interval (CI): 15.9-52.4]. Of 11 patients with lung NEN, the response rate was 64% (n = 7); there was a significant difference in responses by primary tumor location (lung vs. others, P = 0.020). The median PFS was 8.8 months (95% CI: 3.9-11.1 months), and median OS was 32.3 months (95% CI: 20.7-not reached months). Exploratory blood immune cell profiling revealed an increase in circulating CD8+ T cells (27.9% ± 13.4% vs. 31.7% ± 14.6%, P = 0.03) and a decrease in CD4+ T cells (59.6% ± 13.1% vs. 56.5% ± 13.0%, P = 0.001) after 2 weeks of treatment.

Approval was based on FIGHT-202 (NCT02924376), a multicenter open-label single-arm trial. Efficacy was based on 107 patients with locally advanced unresectable or metastatic cholangiocarcinoma whose disease had progressed on or after at least one prior therapy and had an FGFR2 gene fusion or rearrangement. Patients received pemigatinib, 13.5 mg orally, once daily for 14 consecutive days, followed by 7 days off therapy. Safety was based on a total of 466 patients, 146 of whom had cholangiocarcinoma and received the recommended dose. Efficacy endpoints were overall response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DOR) determined by an independent review committee using RECIST 1.1. ORR was 36% (95% confidence interval: 27-45). Median DOR was 9.1 months.

Extensive cross-talk between ER, PI3K, and RTK/RAS/CTNNB1 pathways leads to both ligand-dependent and ligand-independent ER transcriptional activity as well as upregulation of cyclin D1 which, in complex with cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 (CDK4 and CDK6), is a critical regulator of cell cycle progression and a key mediator of resistance to hormonal therapy. We hypothesized that the combination of the aromatase inhibitor letrozole and CDK4/6 inhibitor abemaciclib would demonstrate promising activity in this setting. We conducted a phase II, two-stage study of letrozole/abemaciclib in recurrent ER-positive EC. Eligibility criteria included measurable disease, no limit on prior therapies, and all EC histologies; prior hormonal therapy was allowed. Primary end points were objective response rate by RECIST 1.1 and progression-free survival (PFS) rate at 6 months.

This pilot study investigated ONCOS-102 (oncolytic adenovirus expressing GM-CSF) plus anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD)-1 therapy in anti-PD-1-resistant melanoma. Patients with advanced melanoma progressing after prior PD-1 blockade received intratumoral ONCOS-102 either as priming with 3 doses (3 × 1011 viral particles) during Week 1 [Part 1 (sequential treatment)] or as 4-dose priming and 8 booster doses every 3 weeks [Part 2 (combination treatment)]. From Week 3, all patients received pembrolizumab every 3 weeks (≤8 doses). The primary endpoint was safety. Objective response rate (ORR), progression-free survival, and immunologic activation in repeat biopsies were also investigated. In 21 patients (Part 1, n = 9; Part 2, n = 12) ONCOS-102 plus pembrolizumab was well tolerated: most adverse events (AE) were mild/moderate in severity. Pyrexia (43%), chills (43%), and nausea (28%) were the most common ONCOS-102-related AEs. There were no dose-limiting toxicities. ORR was 35% [response evaluation in solid tumors (RECIST) 1.1, irRECIST]. Reduction in size of ≥1 non-injected lesions observed in 53% patients indicated a systemic effect. In injected tumors, persistent immune-related gene expression and T-cell infiltration were associated with clinical benefit. Viral persistence and efficacy in injected and non-injected lesions without additional toxicity supported Part 2 dosing regimen in future studies. ONCOS-102 plus pembrolizumab was well tolerated and led to objective responses in patients with anti-PD-1-resistant advanced melanoma. ONCOS-102 promoted T-cell infiltration, particularly cytotoxic CD8+ T cells, which persisted at Week 9, driving clinical benefit. Further investigation of ONCOS-102 plus PD-1 blockade is warranted.

    "abstract": "Ovarian cancer is the most lethal gynecologic cancer and intrinsically resistant to checkpoint immunotherapies. We sought to augment innate immunity, building on previous work with IFNs and monocytes. Preclinical experiments were designed to define the mechanisms of cancer cell death mediated by the combination of IFNs α and γ with monocytes. We translated these preclinical findings into a phase I trial of autologous IFN-activated monocytes administered intraperitoneally to platinum-resistant or -refractory ovarian cancer patients. IFN-treated monocytes induced caspase 8-dependent apoptosis by the proapoptotic TRAIL and mediated by the death receptors 4 and 5 (DR4 and DR5, respectively) on cancer cells. Therapy was well tolerated with evidence of clinical activity, as 2 of 9 evaluable patients had a partial response by RECIST criteria, and 1 additional patient had a CA-125 response. Upregulation of monocyte-produced TRAIL and cytokines was confirmed in peripheral blood. Long-term responders had alterations in innate and adaptive immune compartments. Given the mechanism of cancer cell death, and the acceptable tolerability of the clinical regimen, this platform presents a possibility for future combination therapies to augment anticancer immunity.

    "abstract": "A DNA repair deficiency (DRD) phenotype exists within a subset of metastatic urothelial carcinomas (mUC) predicting benefit from platinum-based chemotherapy. We tested switch maintenance therapy with the poly ADP-ribose polymerase inhibitor rucaparib, following chemotherapy, for DRD biomarker-positive mUC. DRD biomarker-positive mUC patients, within 10 weeks of chemotherapy, and without cancer progression, were randomly assigned (1:1) to maintenance rucaparib 600 mg twice a day orally, or placebo, until disease progression. The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS). Statistical analysis targeted a hazard ratio of 0.5 with a 20% one-sided α for this signal-seeking trial. PFS (RECIST 1.1) was compared between trial arms, by intention to treat, within a Cox model. Out of 248 patients, 74 (29.8%) were DRD biomarker-positive and 40 were randomly assigned. A total of 12 (60%) and 20 (100%) PFS events occurred in the rucaparib and placebo arms, respectively (median follow-up was 94.6 weeks in those still alive). Median PFS was 35.3 weeks (80% CI, 11.7 to 35.6) with rucaparib and 15.1 weeks (80% CI, 11.9 to 22.6) with placebo (hazard ratio, 0.53; 80% CI, 0.30 to 0.92; one-sided  Maintenance rucaparib, following platinum-based chemotherapy, extended PFS in DRD biomarker-selected patients with mUC and was tolerable.

    "abstract": "Effective treatments are needed for melanoma that progresses on inhibitors of programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) or its ligand (PD-L1). We conducted the phase II LEAP-004 study to evaluate the combination of the multikinase inhibitor lenvatinib and the PD-1 inhibitor pembrolizumab in this population (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03776136). Eligible patients with unresectable stage III-IV melanoma with confirmed progressive disease (PD) within 12 weeks of the last dose of a PD-1/L1 inhibitor given alone or with other therapies, including cytotoxic T-cell lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) inhibitors, received lenvatinib 20 mg orally once daily plus ≤ 35 doses of pembrolizumab 200 mg intravenously once every 3 weeks until PD or unacceptable toxicity. The primary end point was objective response rate (ORR) per RECIST, version 1.1, by independent central review. A total of 103 patients were enrolled and treated. The median study follow-up was 15.3 months. ORR in the total population was 21.4% (95% CI, 13.9 to 30.5), with three (2.9%) complete responses and 19 (18.4%) partial responses. The median duration of response was 8.3 months (range, 3.2-15.9+). ORR was 33.3% in the 30 patients with PD on prior anti-PD-1 plus anti-CTLA-4 therapy. The median progression-free survival and overall survival in the total population were 4.2 months (95% CI, 3.8 to 7.1) and 14.0 months (95% CI, 10.8 to not reached), respectively. Grade 3-5 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 47 (45.6%) patients, most commonly hypertension (21.4%); one patient died from a treatment-related event (decreased platelet count). Lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab provides clinically meaningful, durable responses in patients with advanced melanoma with confirmed PD on prior PD-1/L1 inhibitor-based therapy, including those with PD on anti-PD-1 plus anti-CTLA-4 therapy. The safety profile was as expected. These data support lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab as a potential regimen for this population of high unmet need.",

    "abstract": "We aimed to investigate the optimal radiologic method to determine Milan criteria (MC) for the prediction of recurrence in patients who underwent locoregional treatment (LRT) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and subsequent liver transplantation (LT). This retrospective study included 121 HCC patients who underwent LRT and had both liver dynamic CT and MRI. They were classified with MC using four cross combinations of two imaging modalities (CT and MRI) and two diagnostic criteria (modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [mRECIST] and Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System treatment response algorithm [LI-RADS TRA]). Competing risk regression was performed to analyze the time to recurrence after LT. The predictive abilities of the four methods for recurrence were evaluated using the time-dependent area under the curve (AUC). Competing risk regression analyses found that beyond MC determined by MRI with mRECIST was independently associated with recurrence (hazard ratio, 6.926; p = 0.001). With mRECIST, MRI showed significantly higher AUCs than CT at 3 years and 5 years after LT (0.597 vs. 0.756, p = 0.012 at 3 years; and 0.588 vs. 0.733, p = 0.024 at 5 years). Using the pathologic reference standard, MRI with LI-RADS TRA showed higher sensitivity (61.5%) than CT with LI-RADS TRA (30.8%, p < 0.001) or MRI with mRECIST (38.5%, p < 0.001). MRI with mRECIST was the optimal radiologic method to determine MC for the prediction of post-LT recurrence in HCC patients with prior LRT. • MRI with modified RECIST (mRECIST) is the optimal preoperative method to determine Milan criteria for the prediction of post-transplant HCC recurrence in patients with prior locoregional treatment. • With mRECIST, MRI was better than CT for the prediction of post-transplant recurrence.",

    "abstract": "Background At least 10% of all patients with knee osteoarthritis (OA) undergo treatment with injectable corticosteroids or hyaluronic acid (HA). Although both have been shown to help with symptomatic pain relief, their long-term effects on knee OA progression remain inconclusive. Purpose To investigate the association between intra-articular knee injections, specifically corticosteroids and HA, and OA progression using a detailed whole-joint semiquantitative MRI evaluation and clinical outcomes for a period of 2 years. Materials and Methods This secondary analysis uses data from the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI), a multicenter, longitudinal, prospective study (February 2004 to January 2015). Participants who received a reported injection of corticosteroid or HA and propensity-score-matched controls (on age, sex, body mass index [calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared], and clinical variables) were analyzed. Using the Whole-Organ MRI Score (WORMS) system for cartilage, bone marrow lesions, and meniscus, 3-T MRI performed at the time of injection, 2 years prior, and 2 years after were semiquantitatively graded. Postinjection progression was quantified using WORMS difference between time of injection and the 2-year follow-up. Associations with injection type were analyzed using repeated measures of analysis of covariance. Results There were 210 participants analyzed (mean age, 64 years ± 7.9 years [SD]; 126 female participants). Corticosteroids were associated with greater WORMS progression compared with controls (mean difference, 0.39; 95% CI: 0.05, 0.75; ",

    "abstract": "To characterize MRI changes of brain metastases (BM) following laser interstitial thermal therapy (LITT), particularly in lesions exhibiting durable response or early progression. Longitudinal scans from patients with LITT-treated BM were retrospectively analyzed. Treatment response was categorized as durable response, long-term disease control (i.e., stable at 1 year), stable disease < 1 year, or progression < 1 year. Volumetric and diffusion MRI changes after LITT were analyzed for each subregion (contrast-enhancing, central non-enhancing, whole lesion). Volumetric changes were modeled with bi-exponential fits in responding lesions and progressors. 295 MRI scans from 47 lesions across 42 patients (57.8 ± 14.3 years old, males:females 21:21) were analyzed. Overall, the post-LITT scan showed a lesion enlargement (p < 0.0001 for all subregions), more pronounced in the contrast-enhancing (CE) component (median = +77%, p < 0.0001), and a reduction in the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) (p < 0.001), especially in the central non-CE component (median = -224 × 10 BM typically exhibit an early volume increase with diffusion restriction after LITT. Responders then show bi-exponential shrinkage with gradual diffusion increase. Progression can usually be detected only after 3-4 months, because earlier radiographic patterns may overlap with responding lesions. Question Laser interstitial thermal therapy (LITT) is an emerging local treatment for brain metastases, but the radiographic patterns following this treatment have not been thoroughly described. Findings Responding lesions showed a typical radiographic pattern with early volumetric enlargement and diffusion restriction (not exclusive of responders), followed by a bi-exponential shrinkage and diffusion elevation. Clinical relevance Being aware of the typical radiographic changes in brain metastases responding to LITT is informative for the interpretation of follow-up images. Early volumetric and diffusion changes (< 3-4 months) do not appear to be reliable markers to predict treatment success.",

    "title": "Personalized risk-adapted models in prostate cancer during active surveillance using MRI-a narrative review.",
    "abstract": "The presence of histologically defined prostate cancer (PCa) is common and rises with age. Nevertheless, histological evidence of PCa does not always lead to clinically evident or life-threatening disease, and we know that PSA-based population screening can find twice the prevalence of PCa than would present via clinical routes. The PROTECT study randomized men diagnosed through PSA screening, to surgery, radiotherapy, or active monitoring. At 15 years, PCa-related deaths ranged from 2.1% in the surgery group to 2.9% in the active monitoring group, while the risk of death from other causes was 22%. Modern PCa diagnosis uses MRI to determine who needs a biopsy and how it is done. Multiparametric MRI can selectively detect PCa of higher grade and volume, which is more likely to be associated with progression, metastases, and death, and hence to benefit from treatment. MRI and MRI-targeted biopsies are recommended prior to enrolment in active surveillance (AS) programs for accurate risk classification. The UCLH AS cohort based on per-cause MRI evaluations has shown baseline Gleason grade and MRI index lesion visibility to be strong predictors of progression to treatment. Serial evaluation with MRI has been codified with the PRECISE recommendations to support MRI-based monitoring during AS. AS recommendations have extended to certain favorable-intermediate risk cancers. The Movember International Consensus Meeting has determined a dynamic risk-stratified AS approach to be the highest-ranked research priority. We review the impact of MRI on AS from patient selection to risk stratification, and the development of MRI-led personalized AS protocols. KEY POINTS: Question Standardized protocols are not able to address the heterogeneity of men on active surveillance for PCa and are burdened by unnecessary examinations. Findings MRI can improve the selection of men for active surveillance, predict time to treatment, and risk-stratify patients at risk of progression. Clinical relevance MRI-led risk-adapted protocols may reduce the burden of active surveillance on patients, improve adherence, and reduce healthcare costs.",

In this longitudinal retrospective multicentre cohort study patients with histopathologically confirmed adult-type diffuse glioma and at least two years survival after diagnosis in 2009-2010 were included. Progression was determined by the treating physician or during the multidisciplinary team meeting and defined as the moment a change in treatment or follow-up was required. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients that showed an increase of abnormalities on both contrast-enhanced T1-weighted (CET1w) and T2w/T2w-FLAIR at the time of progression. Chi-square testing was performed to analyse the relationship between the detection of progression on both scan sequences, with calculating the Phi coefficient to determine the degree of association. One hundred eight consecutive patients were included (58 male; 53 grade 2, 21 grade 3, 34 grade 4). Progression was present in 82 patients and was determined on both CET1w and T2w/T2w-FLAIR images in 59 patients (72.0%). In 20 patients (24.4%), progression was determined based solely on T2w/T2w-FLAIR abnormalities. Only three patients showed progression exclusively on CET1w (3.7%). There was a strong positive significant relationship between the detection of progression on both scan types (p < 0.001; Phi = 0.467). An increase in CET1w abnormalities was generally accompanied by an increase in T2w/T2w-FLAIR abnormalities, raising the question of whether routine administration of GBCA is always necessary for long-term survivors of glioma. Question Long-term survivors with glioma undergo many contrast-enhanced MRI scans, which involve a patient, financial, and environmental burden. Findings In almost all patients, an increase in T2w/T2w-FLAIR abnormalities was present at the time of tumour progression, mostly but not always accompanying contrast-enhancing findings. Clinical relevance T2w/T2-FLAIR MRI seems to detect glioma progression in long-term surviving patients similar to contrast-enhanced T1w MRI, raising the question of whether the routine administration of GBCA is necessary and justified in patients under long-term surveillance of glioma.",

However, the longitudinal atrophy pattern of PSP and potential differences in change rates among PSP phenotypic spectrum remain unclear. This study aims to investigate the longitudinal changes of MRPI measurements and explore their potential role in PSP phenotype progression monitoring. Thirty-six patients with PSP-Richardson's syndrome (PSP-RS), 21 patients with variant PSP (vPSP), and 21 healthy controls (HCs) with longitudinal MRI and clinical follow-up were enrolled. Midbrain-based morphometric measurements and the corresponding annual percentage changes (APCs) were measured and further used to evaluate the associations with disease progression. Significant differences in midbrain-based morphometric biomarkers were observed both at baseline and longitudinal trajectories between PSP and HC groups, but no significant differences were found between PSP-RS and vPSP subgroups. Baseline comprehensive measurements were significantly associated with the baseline PSP rating scale (PSPrs) in all PSP and PSP phenotypes. The APC of MRPI was significantly associated with the APC of PSPrs in all PSP (r = 0.267, p = 0.046) and the PSP-RS subgroup (r = 0.386, p = 0.020). This study characterizes the longitudinal atrophy trajectory of PSP phenotypes and the significant associations between morphometric measurements and disease severity. Dissecting the causal associations among core 4R-tau, dopamine, and subsequent atrophy trajectories may enhance the application of these biomarkers for phenotype attribution. Questions The use of midbrain-based MRPI measurements to assess the longitudinal prognosis of the PSP phenotype remains uncertain. Findings Significant differences in midbrain-based morphometric biomarkers were observed both at baseline and longitudinal trajectories between PSP and health control groups. Clinical relevance Midbrain-based morphometric measurements hold promise as potential radiological biomarkers for monitoring PSP disease progression and assessment.",

This study aimed to confirm that follow-up high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (hrMRI) provided essential values in predicting subsequent cerebral ischemic events in patients with ICAS. Patients with moderate to severe stenosis in the middle cerebral artery (MCA) defined by magnetic resonance (MRA) or computed tomography angiography (CTA) were recruited from three centers retrospectively. Detailed plaque composition was analyzed on baseline and follow-up hrMRI. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was used to identify the key risk factors for predicting subsequent ischemic events. Among 152 patients, a total of 86 patients with MCA atherosclerotic stenosis underwent follow-up hrMRI exams and ipsilateral cerebral ischemic events occurred in 12 patients during a 1-year follow-up. Analyses showed the predictors of ischemic events were age (adjusted Hazard ratio (HR) = 0.942; 95% Confidence Interval (CI), [0.903, 0.983]; p = 0.006), progression of plaque burden (HR = 3.818; 95% CI [1.117, 13.051]; p = 0.033), vessel expansion (HR = 5.173; 95% CI [1.077, 24.838]; p = 0.040) and enhancement ratio progression (HR = 6.144; 95% CI [1.480, 25.511]; p = 0.012).

Question Can longitude high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (hrMRI) help clinicians observe intracranial plaque evolution? Findings Compared with the baseline exam, intracranial plaque evolution distinguished by follow-up hrMRI exam showed a higher accuracy in predicting subsequent ischemic events.

A single center prospectively collected cohort of 150 patients with primary spontaneous ICH were imaged with computed tomography perfusion within 6 h from onset (T0), at 24 h (T1) and at 7 days (T7). Perihematomal cerebral blood flow (pCBF) was measured in the manually outlined perihematomal low-density area and categorized into ischemic (< 20 mL/100 g/min), oligemic (20-39.9 mL/100 g/min), normal (40-55 mL/100 g/min) and hyperemic (> 55 mL/100 g/min). pCBF values were ischemic in 20.7%, oligemic 47.3%, normal in 17.3%, and hyperemic in 14.7% of patients at T0. All patients with T0 ischemia remained ischemic at T7, normal and hyperemic patients at T0 maintained good perfusion values at T7, whereas 46.5% of oligemic patients at T0 developed delayed perihematomal ischemia. In patients with T0 perihematomal oligemia, the risk of conversion into delayed ischemia at T7 was higher in those with pCBF < 30 mL/100 g/min (p < 0.001). A total of 42.7% patients had perihematomal ischemia at T7 and this profile correlated with poor outcome, regardless of baseline perfusion status. Our findings suggest that perihematomal oligemia may not represent a benign entity and indicate that delayed perihematomal ischemia is common and associated with unfavorable outcome. Question The natural history and longitudinal evolution of perihematomal oligemia over time in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) remains to be established. Findings Conversion of baseline perihematomal oligemia into ischemia occurs in 46.5% of oligemic ICH patients at 7 days, where a total of 42.7% patients were ischemic.

This retrospective study included consecutive patients ages < 23 years with MASLD who underwent serial MR elastography (MRE) and/or MR fat fraction (FF) examinations between 09/2009 and 11/2022. Outcomes of MASLD were defined based on maximum ratio values. A relative change ≥ 19% in liver stiffness measures (LSM) and an absolute change ≥ 5% for liver FF were considered clinically meaningful. Random intercept models characterized the yearly rate of change in LSM (kilopascals per year) and FF (percentage per year). One hundred twenty-one patients (87 males, mean age at baseline: 12 ± 3 [SD] years) underwent 297 MRE examinations. The mean interval between the first and last MRE was 34 (± 24) months (range: 1-120 months). Among the 114 patients with serial LSM, 33% (38/114) showed progression, 46% (53/114) remained stable, and 21% (23/114) showed regression.

However, the processes of cancer initiation and the normal-precancer-cancer progression within a non-cancerous tissue context remain poorly understood. This is, in part, due to the scarcity of early-stage clinical samples or suitable models to study early cancer. In this Review, we introduce clinical samples and model systems, such as autochthonous mice and organoid-derived or stem cell-derived models that allow longitudinal analysis of early cancer development. We also present the emerging techniques and computational tools that enhance our understanding of cancer initiation and early progression, including direct imaging, lineage tracing, single-cell and spatial multi-omics, and artificial intelligence models. Together, these models and techniques facilitate a more comprehensive understanding of the poorly characterized early malignant transformation cascade, holding great potential to unveil key drivers and early biomarkers for cancer development. Finally, we discuss how these new insights can potentially be translated into mechanism-based strategies for early cancer detection and prevention.",

Imaging has increased diagnostic discrimination in the evaluation of FLDs. International guidelines have stated the role of radiologists in the diagnosis and management of FLDs, in the context of the interdisciplinary discussion. Chest computed tomography (CT) with high-resolution technique is recommended to correctly recognise signs, patterns, and distribution of individual FLDs. Radiologists may be the first to recognise the presence of previously unknown interstitial lung abnormalities (ILAs) in various settings.

    "title": "Quantitative CT Evaluation of Emphysema Progression over 10 Years in the COPDGene Study.",
    "abstract": "Background Long-term studies of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) can evaluate emphysema progression. Adjustment for differences in equipment and scanning protocols of individual CT examinations have not been studied extensively. Purpose To evaluate emphysema progression in current and former smokers in the COPDGene cohort over three imaging points obtained at 5-year intervals accounting for individual CT parameters. Materials and Methods Current and former cigarette smokers enrolled between 2008 and 2011 from the COPDGene study were prospectively followed for 10 years between 2008 and 2020. Extent of emphysema as adjusted lung density (ALD) from quantitative CT was measured at baseline and at 5- and 10-year follow-up. Linear mixed models adjusted for CT technical characteristics were constructed to evaluate emphysema progression. Mean annual changes in ALD over consecutive 5-year study periods were estimated by smoking status and baseline emphysema. Results Of 8431 participants at baseline (mean age, 60 years ± 9 [SD]; 3905 female participants), 4913 were at 5-year follow-up and 1544 participants were at 10-year follow-up. There were 4134 (49%) participants who were current smokers, and 4449 (53%) participants had more than trace emphysema at baseline. Current smokers with more than trace emphysema showed the largest decline in ALD, with mean annual decreases of 1.4 g/L (95% CI: 1.2, 1.5) in the first 5 years and 0.9 g/L (95% CI: 0.7, 1.2) in the second 5 years. Accounting for CT noise, field of view, and scanner model improved model fit for estimation of emphysema progression (",

    "abstract": "Interstitial lung disease (ILD) impacts mortality in antisynthetase syndrome (ASyS). Computed tomographic (CT) patterns and evolution in ASyS ILD are not well described. We report longitudinal CT patterns in ASyS-ILD and their impact on survival. This is a monocentric retrospective study of 47 patients with ASyS-ILD. Longitudinal CT patterns and fibrosis severity (severity of radiographic features indicating fibrosis) were analyzed by two radiologists in consensus. The association between imaging features and survival was examined using univariate Cox regression analysis. In total, 211 CT scans were analyzed with an average of 4 ± 2 CT scans/patient with a median follow-up of 79 months in 47 patients. Non-fibrotic patterns were present initially in 63.8% (n = 30) of patients, while fibrotic patterns occurred in 36.2% (n = 17). The initial non-fibrotic patterns/abnormalities resolved in 23.3% (n = 7), evolved in 6.7% (n = 2), persisted in 13.3% (n = 4), and progressed in 56.7% (n = 17), while initial fibrotic patterns persisted in 82.4% (n = 14) and progressed in 17.6% (n = 3). Radiographic progression of ILD (progression in CT pattern or increased fibrosis severity) occurred in 53.2% (n = 25) of patients. Advanced age and radiographic progression were associated with decreased survival (all p < 0.05). The presence of ground-glass opacities (GGO) and predominant lower lung distribution of abnormalities on initial CTs were associated with increased survival (all p < 0.05). Progression occurred in 56.7% of ASyS-ILD patients presenting with non-fibrotic patterns. Fibrotic patterns tended to persist. Age and radiographic progression were associated with reduced survival while the initial presence of GGO and predominant lower lobe distribution were associated with increased survival. • In ASyS-ILD, initial non-fibrotic patterns such as OP, cNSIP, or OP-cNSIP tended to progress to fNSIP. • Fibrotic patterns such as fNSIP or UIP in ASyS-ILD tended to persist without pattern changes. • GGO and lower lung predominance on initial CT were associated with better survival while advanced baseline age and radiographic ILD progression during follow-up were associated with decreased survival.",

    "title": "Diabetes-associated thigh muscle degeneration mediates knee osteoarthritis-related outcomes: results from a longitudinal cohort study.",
    "abstract": "We examined the association between diabetes mellitus (DM) and longitudinal MRI biomarkers for thigh muscle degeneration in patients with knee osteoarthritis (KOA) and their mediatory role in worsening KOA-related symptoms. The Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI) participants with radiographic KOA (Kellgren-Lawrence grade ≥ 2) were included. Thighs and corresponding knees of KOA patients with versus without self-reported DM were matched for potential confounders using propensity score (PS) matching. We developed and used a validated deep learning method for longitudinal thigh segmentation. We assessed the association of DM with 4-year longitudinal muscle degeneration in biomarkers of muscle cross-sectional area (CSA) and contractile percentage (non-fat CSA/total CSA). We further investigated whether DM is associated with 9-year risk of KOA radiographic progression, knee replacement (KR), and symptoms worsening. Finally, we evaluated whether the DM-KOA worsening association is mediated through preceding muscle degeneration. After PS matching, 698 thighs/knees were included (185:513 with:without DM; average ± SD age:64 ± 8-years; female/male:1.4). Baseline DM was associated with a decreased contractile percent of total thigh muscles and quadriceps (mean difference, 95%CI -0.16%/year, -0.25 to -0.07, and -0.21%/year, -0.33 to -0.08). DM was also associated with an increased risk of worsening KOA-related symptoms (hazard ratio, 95%CI 1.70, 1.18-2.46) but not radiographic progression or KR. The decrease in quadriceps contractile percent partially mediated the increased risk of symptoms worsening in patients with DM. Baseline DM is associated with thigh muscle degeneration and KOA-related symptoms worsening. As a potentially modifiable risk factor, DM-associated longitudinal thigh muscle degeneration may partially mediate the symptoms worsening in patients with DM and coexisting KOA. • Diabetes mellitus (DM) is associated with worsening knee osteoarthritis (KOA)-related symptoms. • As a potentially modifiable factor, DM-associated thigh muscle (quadriceps) degeneration partially mediates the worsening of KOA-related symptoms.",

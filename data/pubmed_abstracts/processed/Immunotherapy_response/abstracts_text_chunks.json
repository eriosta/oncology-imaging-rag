Retrospective single-center study of consecutive metastatic melanoma and renal cell carcinoma (RCC) patients undergoing first-line ICI treatment.. The iodine concentration measurement time points include prior to initiation of therapy (baseline [BL]), after initiation (follow-up [FU1]), and either time point nearest to 12 months or at time of progression (final follow-up [FFU]).. Target lesion DECT-based whole-volume tumor normalized iodine concentration average (NICave) and size measurements were obtained.. Reference standard was individual lesion FFU status categorized as responders or nonresponders per RECIST 1.1..",

This retrospective study included 107 patients with progressive disease at first evaluation according to RECIST 1.1..

Clinical experience with immune checkpoint modulators shows that editing immune system function can be effective in various solid tumors.. Equally, novel immune-related phenomena accompany this novel therapeutic paradigm.. These effects of immunotherapy challenge the association of tumor size with response or progression and include risks and adverse events that present new demands for imaging to guide treatment decisions.. Emerging and evolving approaches to immunotherapy highlight further key issues for imaging evaluation, such as dissociated response following local administration of immune checkpoint modulators, pseudoprogression due to immune infiltration in the tumor environment, and premature death due to hyperprogression..",

41085394,Feasibility of Auditing Preoperative Breast MRI for Extent-of-Disease Evaluation Using the BI-RADS v2025 Manual.,Radiology,2025,"Background The forthcoming Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) version 2025 (hereafter, v2025) manual recommends auditing breast MRI examinations performed to evaluate the extent of disease in women newly diagnosed with breast cancer. Purpose To investigate the feasibility of this recommended audit using preoperative breast MRI examinations performed over 2 years, report the calculated metrics, and identify any clinical or imaging characteristics associated with improved MRI performance metrics. Materials and Methods Consecutive breast MRI examinations performed from January 2021 to December 2022 at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center were retrospectively reviewed, excluding screening, diagnostic, neoadjuvant chemotherapy response, and nondiagnostic or incomplete preoperative MRI examinations. Recommended audit calculations were performed as described in the BI-RADS v2025 manual: abnormal interpretation rate (AIR) (percentage of positive preoperative MRI examinations), positive predictive value of biopsies recommended (PPV2) (percentage of all distinct BI-RADS category 4 or 5 findings, not examinations, with a tissue diagnosis of cancer at image-guided biopsy), positive predictive value of biopsies performed (PPV3) (percentage of BI-RADS category 4 or 5 findings, not examinations, with preoperative image-guided biopsy revealing a tissue diagnosis of cancer), and additional cancer detection rate (ACDR) (number of additional malignant lesions diagnosed beyond the primary cancer per 1000 MRI examinations). Total time collecting data and performing calculations was recorded. Characteristics of benign and malignant BI-RADS 4 or 5 lesions were compared using the Wilcoxon rank sum test and Fisher exact test. Logistic regression was used to determine characteristics associated with malignancy. Results A total of 1533 preoperative MRI examinations were included (median patient age, 54.6 years; IQR, 45.5-65.2 years; all female), with 464 MRI examinations revealing 609 suspicious breast findings. Subsequent image-guided biopsy for 432 of these findings revealed 139 malignancies. The overall AIR was 30.3% (95% CI: 28.0, 32.6), overall PPV2 was 22.8% (95% CI: 19.5, 26.1), overall PPV3 was 32.2% (95% CI: 27.8, 36.6), and overall ACDR was 90.7 per 1000 examinations (95% CI: 74.3, 107.1). Seven radiologists spent a combined total of 141 hours collecting data and performing audit calculations. Older patient age (odds ratio, 1.04; 95% CI: 1.02, 1.05; ",2506
41055500,How I Do It: CT-guided Percutaneous Transthoracic Lung Biopsy.,Radiology,2025,"Imaging of the chest for screening or evaluation of lung pathology is one of the most commonly performed radiologic studies. The identification and confirmation of persistent pulmonary nodules, masses, or consolidations on cross-sectional imaging studies warrants additional diagnostic testing to determine the exact pathologic abnormality. Diagnostic work-up may include sputum cytologic examination, thoracentesis, transbronchial aspiration, or percutaneous transthoracic lung biopsy (PTLB). Due to advances in imaging and medical technology, CT-guided core needle biopsy has largely replaced fluoroscopic-guided fine-needle aspiration in PTLB. The goals of PTLB are to accurately target lung lesions of varying sizes, morphologic characteristics, and locations while obtaining adequate samples for histologic diagnosis, microbiologic assessment, and molecular profiling of tumors. Commonly performed by general, thoracic, or interventional radiologists, PTLB must be executed with precision and efficiency to meet these objectives. Potential complications can be life-threatening and require prompt recognition and management. Therefore, all radiologists performing PTLB should be well versed in the principles, techniques, and latest developments in the field to provide safe, effective, and efficient care to their patients. At our institution, the interventional radiology team performs all PTLB procedures and are well equipped to perform CT-guided lung biopsies, adhering closely to the principles outlined in this article.",1531
41055497,Comparison of 10-year Survival Outcomes between CT Surveillance and Surgery for Ground-Glass Nodules.,Radiology,2025,"Background The debate over whether to manage pulmonary ground-glass nodules (GGNs) that increase in size during surveillance with continued follow-up or surgery poses challenges in clinical practice. Purpose To provide evidence-based insights into the long-term survival and appropriateness of surveillance for GGNs, particularly those that increase in size during follow-up. Materials and Methods In this prospective study, patients with GGNs detected at CT examinations between March 2005 and December 2013 were included at the National Cancer Center, China, and followed up until May 2024. The primary analysis compared overall survival (OS) between the surveillance and surgery groups among all individuals with GGNs, stable GGNs, and GGNs that increased in size. The secondary outcome was recurrence-free survival, confirmed with either pathologic findings or clinical-radiologic consensus. Cost and duration of surgery were also analyzed. Propensity score matching was used to balance baseline characteristics when comparing outcomes between groups. Multivariable Cox proportional hazard models were used to determine adjusted hazard ratios and 95% CIs. Results A total of 1003 GGNs in 684 individuals (median age, 56 years; IQR, 49-62 years; 434 female) were evaluated; among them, 40 individuals had dominant GGNs that developed solid components, whereas 644 individuals maintained their status as GGNs. Of these, 207 (32.1%) underwent surgery. There was no evidence of a difference observed in 10-year OS between surveillance and surgery groups (94.7% [95% CI: 92.2, 97.2] vs 97.6% [95% CI: 95.3, 100], respectively; ",1626
41055493,Imaging Features and Diagnostic Performance of US in Nonmass Lesions with Varying Clinical Indications.,Radiology,2025,"Background The diagnostic performance of breast US for nonmass lesions (NML) is not well validated. Purpose To evaluate and compare the imaging features and diagnostic performance of US for NMLs across clinical indications. Materials and Methods This retrospective study included NMLs that underwent US-guided biopsy from January 2014 to February 2021. Lesions were also classified by their clinical indications as screening, diagnostic: work-up (DWU), or diagnostic: current breast cancer (DCBC). Logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with malignancy. The positive predictive values (PPVs) of imaging features and areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUCs) of the clinical Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS)-based assessments were calculated and compared between clinical indication groups using the Fisher exact or χ",876
41025989,Colorectal Cancer and Advanced Adenoma after Single CT Colonography or Biennial FIT Screening in the SAVE Randomized Controlled Trial.,Radiology,2025,"Background A 5-year screening interval for CT colonography (CTC) and a 2-year screening interval for fecal immunochemical tests (FITs) have been recommended on the basis of the natural history of colorectal cancer (CRC). Purpose To assess whether the recommended 5-year interval for screening CTC is appropriate and whether CTC is associated with earlier diagnosis relative to biennial FIT screening. Materials and Methods This secondary analysis of the SAVE randomized controlled trial was conducted between March 2012 and March 2018; 14 981 participants aged 54-65 years were randomly assigned to groups undergoing a single CTC examination or three biennial FITs for CRC screening. After the trial period ended, all participants aged younger than 70 years were invited to undergo biennial FIT. The incidence rates of CRC and advanced adenoma (AdA) until December 31, 2021 (mean, 8.4 years of follow-up), in the 1286 participants who underwent CTC and 6027 participants who underwent at least one trial FIT were compared using Cox regression models adjusted for age, sex, and socioeconomic status. Results In the CTC arm, one interval CRC was observed during the 5 years following CTC, and no cancers were detected thereafter. Overall, nine CRC cases were diagnosed in the CTC arm and 58 in the FIT arm, with no statistically significant difference in CRC incidence rates between the two groups (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.73 [95% CI: 0.36, 1.47]; ",1447
40985829,Molecular Breast Imaging and Digital Breast Tomosynthesis for Dense Breast Screening: The Density MATTERS Trial.,Radiology,2025,"Background Molecular breast imaging (MBI) relies on the functional uptake of a radiotracer, technetium 99m sestamibi, to reveal cancers that are occult on mammograms due to breast density. Purpose To assess the performance of screening MBI as a supplement to digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) in women with dense breasts. Materials and Methods In this prospective, multiyear, multicenter trial from five sites, women with dense breasts were prospectively enrolled from 2017 to 2022 and underwent two annual screening rounds of DBT and MBI to assess the incremental cancer detection rate (CDR, reported as cancers per 1000 screenings) of supplemental MBI and to compare other performance metrics of DBT and MBI. Results A total of 2978 participants were included. Participants had a mean age of 56.8 years ± 9.3 (SD) and a mean lifetime Tyrer-Cuzick risk of 12.0% ± 7.9 (SD). At year 1, the CDR was 5.0‰ (15 of 2978 participants) with DBT and 11.8‰ (35 of 2978 participants) with DBT plus prevalence screening MBI (incremental CDR, 6.7‰ [95% CI: 4.2, 10.6]; ",1058
40976009,Comparative analysis of FES-PET/CT and FDG-PET/CT in patients with ER-positive metastatic invasive lobular breast cancer.,"European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",2025,"Detection of metastatic invasive lobular carcinoma (mILC) with standard imaging is challenging. 2-[18F]Fluoro-2-deoxyglucose (FDG) PET/CT is commonly used in the work-up of metastatic breast cancer (MBC), but may be suboptimal for mILC. 16α-[18F]Fluoro-17β-estradiol (FES) PET/CT measures estrogen receptor (ER) expression, which is generally high in mILC. To assess whether FES-PET/CT outperforms FDG-PET/CT, we compared the detection rate of both scans to identify mILC, in patients who were enrolled in the prospective IMPACT-MBC study. Patients with newly diagnosed ER-positive mILC underwent baseline FDG-PET/CT, FES-PET/CT, diagnostic computed tomography (CT), bone scintigraphy, and a biopsy of a metastasis. The number of metastases visible on FDG-PET/CT or FES-PET/CT was compared to all metastases identified with any imaging modality. Results were analyzed at patient and lesion level. Twenty-six out of 200 patients had ER-positive mILC and were included in this sub-analysis. Mean number of metastases per patient was 34 (2-77) with FDG-PET/CT and 33 (0-88) with FES-PET/CT. In 12 patients (46 %), more metastases were visible on FDG-PET/CT than FES-PET/CT, in 12 patients, this was the reverse. Out of 1101 metastases detected with all imaging modalities, 889 metastases were detected with FDG-PET/CT and 859 with FES-PET/CT, resulting in a detection rate of 81 % (95 % CI 78 - 83) and 78 % (95 % CI 76 - 80), respectively. Two patients had a negative FES-PET/CT, while no patients had a negative FDG-PET/CT. FES-PET/CT and FDG-PET/CT have a similar detection rate in mILC, and FDG-PET/CT should be used for first-step imaging. However, as more metastases are visible on FES-PET/CT in a considerable part of mILC patients, in case of doubt, an additional FES-PET/CT should be considered.",1801
40974865,Acupuncture effect on brain default mode network connectivity in breast cancer patients with hot flashes: A randomized controlled trial.,"European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",2025,"To use functional MRI to assess the effect of acupuncture on brain resting-state functional connectivity in breast cancer patients with hot flashes. A total of 24 breast cancer patients experiencing hot flashes (BC-HF) underwent 5 weeks of acupuncture treatment and follow-up at 4-6 months after therapy. The control groups included 35 patients with breast cancer without hot flashes (BC-NF) and 30 healthy controls respectively. Functional connectivity (FC) within the brain default mode network (DMN) was assessed using resting-state functional MRI at baseline and after treatment. The primary outcome was the change in the hot flash composite score (HFCS), and secondary outcomes included sleep quality and quality of life. Acupuncture significantly improved HFCS (-3.87; 95 % CI, -2.21 to -7.32; p < 0.001) and enhanced FC between the right temporal gyrus and angular area (p = 0.001) as well as the medial prefrontal cortex (p = 0.009). At 4-6 months follow-up, BC-HF group maintained 45.4 % improvement in hot flashes syndrome. No significant changes were observed in the sleep quality or quality of life. A strong correlation was found between increased FC and a reduction in HFCS only in a subgroup of patients who responded positively to acupuncture (r = 0.726, p = 0.001). This study provided the first evidence that acupuncture can enhance brain connectivity within the DMN and significantly alleviate the long-term clinical outcome of HF in breast cancer patients. These findings underscore the potential of acupuncture as a viable nonpharmacological option for managing vasomotor symptoms.",1602
40956165,External Test of a Deep Learning Algorithm for Pulmonary Nodule Malignancy Risk Stratification Using European Screening Data.,Radiology,2025,"Background Low-dose CT screening reduces lung cancer-related deaths but has high rates of false-positive findings. A deep learning (DL) algorithm could improve nodule risk stratification but requires robust external testing. Purpose To externally test a DL algorithm for nodule malignancy risk estimation using pooled data from three large European lung cancer screening trials. Materials and Methods In this retrospective study, a DL algorithm trained on National Lung Screening Trial data was externally tested using baseline CT scans from the Danish Lung Cancer Screening Trial, the Multicentric Italian Lung Detection trial, and the Dutch-Belgian Lung Cancer Screening Trial. Performance was assessed across the pooled cohort and two subsets: subset A, including indeterminate nodules (5-15 mm); and subset B, including cancers size-matched to benign nodules (1:2 ratio). Performance, including the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), was compared with the Pan-Canadian Early Detection of Lung Cancer (PanCan) model. Results The pooled cohort included 4146 participants (median age, 58 years; 78% male participants; median smoking history, 38 pack-years) with 7614 benign and 180 malignant nodules. The DL algorithm achieved AUCs of 0.98, 0.96, and 0.94 for cancers diagnosed within 1 year, 2 years, and throughout screening, respectively, compared with 0.98, 0.94, and 0.93 (",1406
40956163,Radiologist's Guide to the Ninth Edition TNM Staging System for Quantitative and Qualitative Assessment of Pleural Mesothelioma.,Radiology,2025,"Pleural mesothelioma is a highly lethal, rare thoracic malignant neoplasm arising from mesothelial cells. Previous versions of the clinical TNM staging classification have relied on a qualitative radiologic assessment of tumor invasion. However, these qualitative assessments have not proved practical to implement, with poor interobserver agreement and lack of prognostic significance. The updated ninth edition of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer TNM staging system for pleural mesothelioma, jointly published by the American Joint Committee on Cancer and Union for International Cancer Control, proposes key evidence-based changes. The ninth edition incorporates quantitative measurements of pleural tumor and fissural thickness in the T descriptors for pleural mesothelioma and removes the qualitative descriptors that cannot be reliably detected on CT scans, such as endothoracic fascia, lung parenchymal invasion, and nontransmural diaphragm invasion or involvement. This article explains the rationale behind these changes and provides a practical guide to the ninth edition of the TNM staging system in clinical practice.",1155
40956160,False-Positive Recall and False-Positive Biopsy Rates in Mammography Screening: A TOSYMA Trial Subanalysis.,Radiology,2025,"Background False-positive results may negatively affect participants and diminish the efficiency of mammography screening programs. Purpose To assess whether the higher breast cancer detection rate with digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) plus synthesized mammography (SM) compared with digital mammography (DM) in the randomized TOmosynthesis plus SYnthesized MAmmography (TOSYMA) trial comes with higher false-positive rates. Materials and Methods The TOSYMA trial was conducted from July 2018 to December 2020 in women aged 50-70 years (mean age, 57.7 years ± 5.6 [SD]), with 1:1 allocation to the DBT plus SM or DM study arm (NCT03377036). True- and false-positive recall rates, false-positive biopsy rates, and positive predictive values of recalls and biopsies performed were compared per arm. Women with false-positive findings were followed up for 24 months. The analyses were strictly exploratory. Results There were 49 762 women in the DM arm and 49 715 in the DBT plus SM arm. The recall rate was 48.6 per 1000 women screened (2416 of 49 715) with DBT plus SM and 49.9 per 1000 women screened (2483 of 49 762) with DM. The true-positive recall rate of DBT plus SM (8.4 per 1000 women screened; 416 of 49 715) was higher than that of DM (6.2 per 1000 women screened; 306 of 49 762), a difference of 2.2 per 1000 women screened (CI: 0.4, 4.0). The false-positive recall rate was lower with DBT plus SM (40.2 per 1000 women screened; 2000 of 49 715) than with DM (43.7 per 1000 women screened [2177 of 49 762]; difference: -3.5 per 1000 women screened [CI: -7.8, 0.7]), particularly in the first screening round (DBT plus SM: 94.0 per 1000 women; DM: 109.6 per 1000 women screened; difference, -15.6 per 1000 women screened [CI: -31.0, -0.2]). The positive predictive value of recall was higher with DBT plus SM (17.2%; 416 of 2416 women recalled) than with DM (12.3% [306 of 2483 women recalled]; difference, 4.9% [CI: 1.5, 8.3]). The false-positive biopsy rate (7.8 per 1000 women screened; 388 of 49 715) was higher with DBT plus SM (1.8 per 1000 women screened; CI: 0.0, 3.6), and the positive predictive value of biopsies performed was 51.7% (416 of 804 women with biopsies performed; difference, 1.1%; CI: -7.9, 10.2). Interval cancers after false-positive recalls were rare (five with DBT plus SM and two with DM). Conclusion This exploratory analysis of the large randomized TOSYMA trial indicates that DBT plus SM showed lower false-positive recall rates than DM, especially in first-round screening participants. Mildly raised false-positive biopsies of DBT plus SM were compensated by more detected breast cancers. ClinicalTrial.gov identifier: NCT03377036 © RSNA, 2025 ",2688

40923882,Emphysema at Baseline Low-Dose CT Lung Cancer Screening Predicts Death from Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease and Cardiovascular Disease Up to 25 Years Later.,Radiology,2025,"Background The prognostic value of baseline visual emphysema scoring at low-dose CT (LDCT) in lung cancer screening cohorts is unknown. Purpose To determine whether a single visual emphysema score at LDCT is predictive of 25-year mortality from all causes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Materials and Methods In this prospective cohort study, asymptomatic adults aged 40-85 years with a history of smoking underwent baseline LDCT screening for lung cancer between June 2000 and December 2008. Follow-up continued until death, loss to follow-up, or December 31, 2024. Emphysema was assessed at baseline LDCT and scored from 0 (none) to 3 (severe) by one of four experienced chest radiologists. Baseline smoking history and comorbidities were self-reported. Causes of death (International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision) were obtained from the U.S. National Death Index, physicians, and family. Associations between emphysema and mortality were evaluated using adjusted Cox proportional hazards and adjusted Fine-Gray competing risks models. Results Among 9047 participants (4614 female; median age, 65 years [IQR, 61-69 years]; median pack-years of smoking, 43 [IQR, 28-64]), 2637 (29.1%) had emphysema (mild in 1908 [21.1%], moderate in 512 [5.7%], and severe in 217 [2.4%]).

40912058,The art of diagnosing rare skin tumors: Can DL-CNNs enhance dermatologists' diagnostic accuracy?,"European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",2025,"Deep learning convolutional neural networks (DL-CNN) achieved diagnostic accuracies comparable to dermatologists in controlled test environments. However, their performance in diagnosing rare skin tumors (RST) remains unclear. This study aimed to evaluate a binary DL-CNN's diagnostic performance in RST and assess the level of support for an international group of dermatologists. In a cross-sectional reader study, a market-approved binary DL-CNN (Moleanalyzer-Pro) assessed 200 dermoscopic images in a conveniance sample of histologically confirmed RST. An international panel of dermatologists rated malignancy and management across three levels: (I) dermoscopy only, (II) dermoscopy, close-up images, and metadata, (III) level-II plus DL-CNN malignancy predictions. Sensitivity, specificity, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC) for the DL-CNN versus dermatologists (level-II). Secondary outcomes included performance changes across study levels. The DL-CNN achieved a sensitivity (95 % CI) of 66.7 % (56.4 %-75.6 %), specificity of 56.4 % (47.0 %-65.3 %), and ROC-AUC of 0.634 (0.557-0.711). Dermatologists reached a significantly higher mean sensitivity (80.3 %, 77.3 %-83.4 %), specificity (65.1 %, 61.3 %-69.0 %), and ROC-AUC (0.839, 0.783-0.894; all p < 0.001). With DL-CNN predictions, dermatologists' sensitivity slightly increased (81.3 %, p = 0.032), specificity decreased (64.0 %, p = 0.036), and ROC-AUC remained unchanged. The DL-CNN could not improve dermatologists' accuracy in misclassified cases. The tested DL-CNN showed a limited diagnostic performance in diagnosing RST. While minor effects on expert decision-making were observed, overall diagnostic accuracy remained highest with full clinical context. Better training data are needed for improved DL-CNN performance in RST.",1836

40875213,Iodine Seed-Marking Protocol for Response-Guided Axillary Treatment After Systemic Therapy for Node-Positive Breast Cancer.,JAMA oncology,2025,"Most patients with clinically node-positive (cN+) breast cancer receive primary systemic treatment (PST) followed by axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) and/or locoregional radiation (RT). The necessity of axillary treatment in patients achieving nodal pathologic complete response (pCR) after PST remains uncertain. To assess oncologic outcomes of response-guided axillary treatment determined by marking the axillary lymph node with a radioactive iodine seed (MARI) in patients with cN+ breast cancer who experience pCR after PST. This cohort study was conducted at a single center including patients with breast cancer with 3 or fewer axillary lymph nodes on fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography-computed tomography who were treated according to the MARI protocol from July 2014 to December 2021. Patients with intramammary or periclavicular lymph node involvement were excluded. Median (IQR) follow-up was 49 (32-70) months. Data were analyzed from March to June 2025. After PST, the MARI-marked lymph node was excised. Patients with pCR of the MARI node (ypN0) received no further axillary treatment, whereas patients with residual disease (ypN+) received locoregional radiation therapy. The primary outcome measure was axillary recurrence rate. The secondary outcome measures were 5-year invasive disease-free survival (iDFS) and overall survival (OS). In total, 350 patients (median [IQR] age, 49 [41-56] years) were included and analyzed; of these, 135 (39%) had ypN0 and received no further axillary treatment. The remaining 215 patients with ypN+ (61%) received RT. After a median (IQR) follow-up of 49 (32-70) months, axillary recurrence rate was 0.7% (n = 1; 95% CI, 0.04%-4.1%) in patients with ypN0 and 2.3% (n = 7; 95% CI, 1.0%-5.3%) in patients with ypN+. In patients with ypN0, the 5-year iDFS was 93% (95% CI, 88%-98%) and the OS was 98% (95% CI, 95%-100%); in patients with ypN+, iDFS was 87% (95% CI, 82%-93%) and OS, 93% (95% CI, 89%-97%). This cohort study found that response-guided axillary treatment, using the MARI protocol, in patients with limited nodal disease who received PST was associated with a very low risk of axillary recurrence and should be considered to protect patients from axillary overtreatment.",2252

Materials and Methods An AI model was introduced that outputs a probability of malignancy (PoM) and a measure of its uncertainty. Eight candidate uncertainty metrics, based on one or all suspicious regions, were tested. A hybrid reading approach was proposed, with recall decisions made by the model only when predictions were deemed confident; otherwise, radiologist double reading was applied. The approach was retrospectively optimized and tested with a previously unseen set of screening examinations from July 2003 to August 2018, split 50-50. Recall and cancer detection rates were compared with standard double reading. The model's area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was compared between examinations with uncertain predictions and examinations with certain predictions. One-tailed ",1157
40818168,Identifying melanoma among benign simulators - Is there a role for deep learning convolutional neural networks? (MelSim Study).,"European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",2025,"Early detection of cutaneous melanoma (CM) is crucial for patient survival, yet avoiding overdiagnosis remains essential. Differentiating CM from benign melanoma simulators (MelSim) is challenging due to overlapping features. Deep learning convolutional neural networks (DL-CNNs) have demonstrated dermatologist-level accuracy in identifying CM. We hypothesized that support from DL-CNN could increase dermatologists' accuracy in differentiating CM from MelSim. This cross-sectional reader study analyzed the diagnostic performance of a DL-CNN and 27 dermatologists for 200 skin lesions (100 CM, 100 MelSim). The DL-CNN assigned malignancy scores ranging from 0 to 1 (> 0.5 indicating malignancy). Dermatologists assessed lesions across three levels: (I) dermoscopy only, (II) full case information (dermoscopy, close-up images, metadata), and (III) full case information plus DL-CNN scores. Primary outcomes were sensitivity, specificity, and ROC-AUC of dermatologists with or without DL-CNN-support (level-II versus -III). The DL-CNN and dermatologists in level-II showed a comparable sensitivity (95 % CI) of 90.0 % (82.6-94.5 %) and 90.1 % (86.9-93.2 %, p = 0.153), respectively. However, the DL-CNN's specificity (67.0 % (57.3-75.4 %) versus 73.2 % (69.1-77.3 %)) and ROC-AUC (0.889 (0.845-0.932) versus 0.951 (0.920-0.982)) were significantly lower than for dermatologists (all p < 0.01). When dermatologists integrated DL-CNN predictions (level-III) their sensitivity increased to 91.4 % (88.3-94.5 %, p < 0.001) without markedly changing specificity (74.2 % (70.6-77.7 %, p = 0.435)) or ROC-AUC (0.954 (0.927-0.982, p = 0.581)). Collaboration with a DL-CNN slightly improved dermatologists' diagnostic accuracy in a mixed CM and MelSim dataset, by increasing sensitivity without a loss of specificity. The DL-CNN's level of sensitivity in this difficult-to-diagnose dataset underlines the potential as an assistant diagnostic tool.",1939
40793948,Performance of Algorithms Submitted in the 2023 RSNA Screening Mammography Breast Cancer Detection AI Challenge.,Radiology,2025,"Background The 2023 RSNA Screening Mammography Breast Cancer Detection AI Challenge invited participants to develop artificial intelligence (AI) models capable of independently interpreting mammograms. Purpose To assess the performance of the submitted algorithms, explore the potential for improving performance by combining the best-performing AI algorithms, and investigate how performance was influenced by the demographic and clinical characteristics of the evaluation cohort. Materials and Methods A total of 1687 AI algorithms were submitted from November 2022 to February 2023. Of these, 1537 algorithms were assessed using an evaluation dataset from two sites-one in the United States and one in Australia. Cancer cases were identified at screening and confirmed with pathologic examination; noncancer cases were followed up for at least 1 year. Results for ensemble models of top algorithms were computed by recalling a case when any of the included algorithms indicated recall. Odds ratios (ORs) were used to investigate differences in AI performance when the dataset was stratified by clinical or demographic characteristics. Results The evaluation dataset consisted of 5415 women (median age, 59 years [IQR, 52-66 years]). Among the 1537 AI algorithms, the median recall rate, sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value (PPV) were 1.7%, 27.6%, 98.7%, and 36.9%, respectively. For the top-ranked algorithm, the recall rate, sensitivity, specificity, and PPV were 1.5%, 48.6%, 99.5%, and 64.6%, respectively. Ensemble models of the top 3 and top 10 algorithms had a sensitivity of 60.7% and 67.8%, respectively; the corresponding recall rates were 2.4% and 3.5%, and the corresponding specificities were 98.8% and 97.8%.

However, clinical trials are needed to investigate these findings. We hypothesized that an exercise program during neoadjuvant chemotherapy would improve tumor response in patients with breast cancer. Neo-train was a randomized controlled trial allocating patients with breast cancer to the usual care control (CON) group or the exercise (EX) group that received supervised high-intensity interval training and progressive resistance training 3 times weekly during 18 to 24 weeks of neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The two groups were compared on tumor size, assessed using magnetic resonance imaging as primary outcome, and secondary clinical/pathologic, biological, physical, and patient-reported outcomes. From 2021 to 2023, 102 participants were randomly assigned to the EX (n = 50) or CON (n = 52) group. We found no between-group differences in median tumor size change from baseline to presurgery (EX vs. CON -3.0 mm [95% confidence interval (CI), -8.0 to 14.0]), the proportion with radiologic complete response [EX 65% vs. CON 56%; odds ratio 1.16 (95% CI, 0.39-3.91)], or pathologic complete response [EX 59% vs. CON 56%; odds ratio 1.03 (95% CI, 0.43-2.46)]. The exercise program was associated with higher relative dose intensity, fewer dose delays, shorter hospital stays, and increased cardiorespiratory fitness, muscle strength, and level of physical activity. We found no differences in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, body composition, health-related quality of life, anxiety, depression, psychological distress, or participation in rehabilitation between groups. Although the exercise program did not affect tumor size, the positive effects on chemotherapy completion and shorter hospitalizations suggest improved treatment tolerance.",1839
40788181,Transrectal Ultrasound-Guided Prostate Biopsy with and without PSMA-PET-Targeted Prostate Biopsy for Prostate Cancer Diagnosis.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,2025,"Transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy (TRUS-GB) is associated with the underdiagnosis of prostate cancer, and prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-PET-targeted prostate biopsy (PSMA-TB) may reduce the misclassification of prostate cancer. The primary outcome of the study was the accuracy of the two methods in identifying clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa). The secondary outcomes included accuracy in identifying clinically insignificant prostate cancer (GG1) and GG3 or greater tumors, cancer detection stratified by the previous biopsy status, and the detection rate of csPCa using the combination of PSMA-TB and TRUS-GB. In this multicenter, two-arm, randomized study, biopsy-naïve patients suspected of having prostate cancer and advised to undergo prostate biopsy were randomly assigned to the PSMA-TB + TRUS-GB (combined) and TRUS-GB (control) groups. A total of 815 men were assessed for eligibility, and 727 men were randomly assigned to the PSMA-TB + TRUS-GB group or the TRUS-GB group. The detection rate of csPCa in the group subjected to the combination of PSMA-TB and TRUS-GB was significantly greater than that in the conventional TRUS-GB group (67.0% vs. 60.1%; P = 0.042). In the PSMA-TB + TRUS-GB group, the rate of csPCa detection by PSMA-TB was significantly greater than that by TRUS-GB (63.5% vs. 57.7%; P < 0.001), whereas the combined strategies achieved the highest detection rate (67.0% vs. 63.5%, P < 0.001; 67.0% vs. 57.7%, P < 0.001). The diagnostic efficacy of TRUS-GB with PSMA-TB was significantly greater than that of TRUS-GB alone. If available, PSMA-TB should be performed alongside TRUS-GB in a combined manner rather than each method alone for the most accurate pathologic results.",1744

40762850,External Testing of a Deep Learning Model for Lung Cancer Risk from Low-Dose Chest CT.,Radiology,2025,"Background Sybil, an open-source deep learning model that uses low-dose CT (LDCT) for lung cancer prediction, requires rigorous external testing to confirm generalizability. Additionally, its utility in identifying individuals with high risk who never smoked or have light smoking histories remains unanswered. Purpose To externally test Sybil for identifying individuals with high risk for lung cancer within an Asian health checkup cohort. Materials and Methods This retrospective study analyzed LDCT scans from a single medical checkup facility in a study sample of individuals aged 50-80 years, collected between January 2004 and December 2021, with at least one follow-up scan. The predictive performance of the model for lung cancer risk over a 6-year period was assessed using the time-dependent area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). These evaluations were conducted in the overall study sample and within subgroups of patients with heavy (at least 20 pack-years) and never- or light smoking histories (ie, ever smoking [median, 2 pack-years]; ineligible for lung cancer screening per 2021 U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendations). Additionally, performance was evaluated according to the visibility of lung cancers on baseline LDCT scans. Results: Among 18 057 individuals (median age, 56 years [IQR, 52-61 years]; 11 267 male), 92 lung cancers were diagnosed (0.5%) within 6 years. Of these, 2848 had heavy smoking histories and 9943 had never- or light smoking histories, with 24 (0.8%) and 41 (0.4%) lung cancers, respectively. Sybil achieved AUCs of 0.91 for 1-year risk and 0.74 for 6-year risk. In the heavy-smoking subgroup, 1-year AUC was 0.94 (for visible lung cancers) and 6-year AUC was 0.70 (for future lung cancers). For the never- or light-smoking subgroup, Sybil had an AUC of 0.89 for visible lung cancers and 0.56 for future lung cancers. Conclusion: Sybil demonstrated excellent discriminative performance for visible lung cancers and acceptable performance for future lung cancers in Asian individuals with heavy smoking history but demonstrated poor performance for future lung cancers in a never- or light-smoking subgroup. © RSNA, 2025 ",2202

Purpose To develop an efficient, generalizable pipeline for MRI-based ovarian lesion characterization. Materials and Methods In this retrospective study, multiparametric MRI datasets of patients with ovarian lesions from a primary institution (January 2008 to January 2019) and two external institutions (January 2010 to October 2020) were analyzed. Lesions were automatically segmented using Meta's Segment Anything Model (SAM). A DenseNet-121 deep learning (DL) model incorporating both imaging and clinical data was then trained and validated externally for ovarian lesion classification. Lesions were evaluated by radiologists using the Ovarian-Adnexal Reporting and Data System for MRI and subjective assessment, classifying them as benign or malignant. The classification performances of the DL model and radiologists were compared using the DeLong test. Results The primary dataset included 534 lesions from 448 women (mean age, 52 years ± 15 [SD]) from institution A (United States), whereas the external datasets included 58 lesions from 55 women (mean age, 51 years ± 19) from institution B (United States) and 29 lesions from 29 women (mean age, 49 years ± 10) from institution C (Taiwan).

Therefore, novel markers for noninvasive molecular profiling are needed. To determine whether advanced image analysis and machine learning on routinely acquired MRI scans can help predict HCC molecular profiles, thereby allowing biomarker-guided treatment allocations. This single-center retrospective study included treatment-naive patients with HCC who underwent tumor resection or liver transplant between September 2006 and February 2022. Multiparametric contrast-enhanced MRI data were obtained, and quantitative and qualitative imaging markers were extracted from lesion and liver segmentations. Pathologic analysis of the resected samples was performed via immunohistochemistry to assess p53 loss of function; catenin beta 1 (CTNNB1) activation; forkhead box M1 activation; and programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1), phosphorylated AKT serine/threonine kinase, phosphorylated SMAD2/3, and sterol O-acyltransferase 1 expression. For each molecular profile outcome, a multivariable logistic regression model was built separately using quantitative imaging, qualitative imaging, or clinical data. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was used to evaluate model discriminatory performance, and DeLong tests were performed to compare AUCs across models trained on the different data. Seventy-five patients with T1-weighted, contrast-enhanced, dynamic MRI scans (mean age, 65.7 years ± 9.43 [SD]; 60 males) were included. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis demonstrated the good discriminatory performance of logistic regression models trained on quantitative imaging data for PD-L1, p53, and CTNNB1, with AUCs of 0.85 (95% CI: 0.74, 0.96), 0.79 (95% CI: 0.66, 0.93), and 0.7 (95% CI: 0.46, 0.93), respectively.

Oncology,2025,"This Policy Review provides recommendations for the use of PET imaging in patients with gliomas and represents a joint effort of the Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) working group for PET and the European Association for Neuro-Oncology. The initial guideline was published in 2016, and summarised the previously established clinical benefit of PET with radiolabelled glucose and amino acid tracers in patients with gliomas. Since then, numerous additional studies have been published on this topic, focusing on differential diagnosis, prediction of molecular information, and prognostication. Further studies evaluated PET for biopsy guidance and delineation of glioma extent for local therapy planning, including resection and radiotherapy. In patients undergoing treatment, PET was studied for the assessment of response to local and systemic treatments and PET-based standardised response criteria (PET RANO 1.0) were proposed. In this Policy Review, the updated recommendations are based on evidence generated from studies that validated PET findings by histomolecular findings or clinical course. This guideline further underscores the previously reported clinical value of PET imaging and the superiority of amino acid PET over glucose PET, providing a framework for the use of PET in the management of patients with gliomas. The guideline also underscores the scarcity of class 1 evidence showing that incorporating PET imaging into clinical workflows improves patient outcomes, highlighting priority areas for future clinical studies designed to address this gap.",1583

Purpose To evaluate the performance of an artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm in detecting and localizing interval cancers at screening DBT and to validate the diagnostic threshold of the algorithm by analyzing its performance across interval, true-positive, true-negative, and false-positive screening DBT examinations. Materials and Methods Screening DBT examinations performed immediately before confirmed interval cancer diagnoses between February 2011 and June 2023 at an academic institution were retrospectively analyzed by a U.S. Food and Drug Administration-cleared AI algorithm. Lesions marked by AI on DBT sections were assigned a score from 0 to 100, with the examination-level score reflecting the highest lesion score. AI-positive examinations (score ≥10) were independently reviewed by two breast imaging radiologists to determine whether AI annotations corresponded to the site of the subsequent cancer. Imaging and clinicopathologic features were compared between interval cancers detected and not detected by AI using the Wilcoxon signed rank test and Fisher exact test. Using the same threshold score, 1000 true-positive, true-negative, and false-positive screening DBT examinations were also analyzed by AI.

40712255,Evaluation of screening mammography effectiveness: The IARC recommendations of 2015 need revision.,"European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",2025,"Breast cancer screening effectiveness is measured by its ability to reduce breast cancer mortality in real world settings. A viewpoint issued by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) in 2015 considered that observational studies (cohort and case-control) are the preferred methods to evaluate the effectiveness of mammography screening. A statistical method was deemed to correct for differences in personal characteristics between women choosing to attend or to not attend screening (self-selection bias). But we showed in a systematic review of observational studies that, compared to women who never attend screening, attenders have a 45 % reduction in their risk of breast cancer death (95 % CI: 40-50 %) and a 46 % reduction (95 % CI: 42-50 %) in their risk of death from a cause other than breast cancer. Screening mammography has no known beneficial influence on causes of death other than breast cancer. If screening mammography reduced the risk of breast cancer death, one would expect a much greater percentage reduction in the risk of breast cancer death than in the risk of all-cause death. Our results suggest that screening mammography attendance is an indicator of personal characteristics associated with a lower risk of dying from any cause, including from breast cancer, which observational studies have misinterpreted as a screening effect. This paper calls into question the IARC 2015 recommendations and advocates the reinstatement of recommendations made by the IARC in 2002 which were based on the use of descriptive and comparative studies.",1581

Equivocal findings can delay the potential for salvage curative treatment or result in over- treatment with further surgery. The aims of this study were to establish if liquid biopsy (LB) of circulating tumour DNA, could be used to aid decision-making after treatment. Patients (n = 41) undergoing chemoradiotherapy (CRT) and surgical treatment had serial blood testing; pre-treatment and 10-12 weeks post-treatment, alongside imaging. PET-CT/MRIs were categorised as Cancer, Equivocal or Complete Response and true disease status was determined retrospectively. A bespoke 17-gene panel and probes targeting 5 HPV subtypes were used for next-generation sequencing in the ctDNA assay. PET-CT was equivocal in 13/27 CRT patients; sensitivity and specificity for determining true disease status was 67 % and 42 % respectively. LB performed better at determining true disease status than PET-CT post-treatment in CRT patients; sensitivity and specificity of 83 % and 95 % respectively.

Most prevalent ≥grade 3 toxicities included leukopenia (n = 80 [96%]), thrombocytopenia (n = 71 [86%]), anemia (n = 57 [69%]), and febrile neutropenia (n = 46 [55%]). Forty-eight (60%) of 80 patients with centrally reviewed PET2 were scheduled for 4×BrECADD and 32 (40%) for 6×BrECADD. Of these, 71 patients (89%) received the target number of cycles. Sixty-eight patients (82%; 95% CI, 72 to 90) achieved CR at EOC. PFS and OS estimates at 2 years were 91.5% (95% CI, 85 to 98) and 90.8% (95% CI, 84 to 98), respectively. No death was attributed to study treatment. Initially, impaired HRQoL scores improved during follow up and on average reached population reference values. PET-guided BrECADD in older patients is feasible and effective. With a PFS rate on par with that of younger patients, short duration, and limited anthracycline exposure, BrECADD is a valuable treatment option also for older patients with AS-cHL.",2076
40662973,Cancer Detection in Breast MRI Screening via Explainable AI Anomaly Detection.,Radiology,2025,"Background Artificial intelligence (AI) models hold potential to increase the accuracy and efficiency of breast MRI screening; however, existing models have not been rigorously evaluated in populations with low cancer prevalence and lack interpretability, both of which are essential for clinical adoption. Purpose To develop an explainable AI model for cancer detection at breast MRI that is effective in both high- and low-cancer-prevalence settings. Materials and Methods This retrospective study included 9738 breast MRI examinations from a single institution (2005-2022), with external testing in a publicly available multicenter dataset (221 examinations). In total, 9567 consecutive examinations were used to develop an explainable fully convolutional data description (FCDD) anomaly detection model to detect malignancies on contrast-enhanced MRI scans. Performance was evaluated in three cohorts: grouped cross-validation (for both balanced [20.0% malignant] and imbalanced [1.85% malignant] detection tasks), an internal independent test set (171 examinations), and an external dataset. Explainability was assessed through pixelwise comparisons with reference-standard malignancy annotations. Statistical significance was assessed using the Wilcoxon signed rank test. Results FCDD outperformed the benchmark binary cross-entropy (BCE) model in cross-validation for both balanced (mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC] = 0.84 ± 0.01 [SD] vs 0.81 ± 0.01; ",1491
40645032,"The correlation of liquid biopsy genomic data to radiomics in colon, pancreatic, lung and prostatic cancer patients.","European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",2025,"With the advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and precision medicine, radiomics has emerged as a promising tool in the field of oncology. Radiogenomics integrates radiomics with genomic data, potentially offering a non-invasive method for identifying biomarkers relevant to cancer therapy. Liquid biopsy (LB) has further revolutionized cancer diagnostics by detecting circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), enabling real-time molecular profiling. This study explores the integration of radiomics and LB to predict genomic alterations in solid tumors, including lung, colon, pancreatic, and prostate cancers. A retrospective study was conducted on 418 patients from the STING trial (NCT04932525), all of whom underwent both LB and CT imaging. Predictive models were developed using an XGBoost logistic classifier, with statistical analysis performed to compare tumor volumes, lesion counts, and affected organs across molecular subtypes. Performance was evaluated using area under the curve (AUC) values and cross-validation techniques. Radiomic models demonstrated moderate-to-good performance in predicting genomic alterations. KRAS mutations were best identified in pancreatic cancer (AUC=0.97), while moderate discrimination was noted in lung (AUC=0.66) and colon cancer (AUC=0.64). EGFR mutations in lung cancer were detected with an AUC of 0.74, while BRAF mutations showed good discriminatory ability in both lung (AUC=0.79) and colon cancer (AUC=0.76). In the radiomics predictive model, AR mutations in prostate cancer showed limited discrimination (AUC = 0.63). This study highlights the feasibility of integrating radiomics and LB for non-invasive genomic profiling in solid tumors, demonstrating significant potential in patient stratification and personalized oncology care. While promising, further prospective validation is required to enhance the generalizability of these models.",1891

While axillary ultrasound (AUS) is a well-established tool in the upfront surgery setting, its performance after NACT is still questioned. Here, we assess the reliability of AUS in predicting the pathological axillary status after NACT using data from the large prospective multicenter AXSANA trial. Between June 1, 2020, and May 31, 2024, 5.559 patients were enrolled in the AXSANA trial. For this analysis, patients with clinically node-positive breast cancer who underwent AUS after NACT were eligible. AUS`s sensitivity, specificity, positive (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) were analyzed using surgical staging as reference. 3840 patients were eligible for this analysis. Of these, 3428(89.3 %) patients underwent preoperative AUS after NACT, classified as unclear in 168(4.9 %), positive in 1060(30.9 %) and negative in 2200 (64.2 %). An axillary pathological complete response (pCR) was achieved in 1793(55.0 %). Nodal metastases were detected in 786 of 2200 patients (35.7 %) with an negative AUS, while 379(35.8 %) of 1060 patients with a positive AUS achieved an axillary pCR. AUS sensitivity was 46.4 %(95 % CI 43.8 %-49.0 %), specificity 78.9 %(76.9 %-80.7 %), PPV 64.2 %(61.3 %-67.1 %), and NPV 64.3 %(62.2 %-66.3 %). PPV was highest for HR+ /HER2- tumors (81.9 %, 78.9 %-85.2 %), NPV for HR-/HER2 + tumors (88.3 %, 84.2 %-91.7 %). Triple negative and HER2 + subtypes were significantly less frequently associated with false-negative AUS results than an HR+ /HER2- cancer. AUS alone does not reliably predict pathological nodal status. Axillary lymph node dissection based on positive AUS findings after NACT results in surgical overtreatment. Surgical axillary staging after NACT remains essential for the accurate assessment of axillary lymph node status in patients with initially node-positive breast cancer.",2021

Tools like LIFEx have improved the accessibility, transparency, and reproducibility of radiomic feature extraction by offering standardized, user-friendly workflows across imaging modalities. Introduction of such a platform that enables consistent and transparent analytics has helped democratize access to the exploration of radiomics and has highlighted other fundamental challenges in radiomics, addressing upstream heterogeneity in image acquisition, reconstruction, and region-of-interest segmentation that impede reproducibility. Differences in these upstream steps can drastically alter radiomic features, even when downstream processing is standardized. We highlight ongoing efforts and fundamental challenges that the community will need to tackle collectively to enable the clinical translation of radiomics.

40590696,Posttreatment MRI to Predict Pathologic Complete Response of Triple-Negative Breast Cancer to Neoadjuvant Chemoimmunotherapy.,Radiology,2025,"Background Neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy (NACI) has substantially improved pathologic complete response (pCR) rates in early triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). However, the predictive accuracy of posttreatment MRI remains unexplored. Purpose To assess the performance of posttreatment MRI in the prediction of pCR in participants with TNBC treated with NACI. Materials and Methods In this prospective multicenter study (August 2021-June 2024), women with early TNBC were recruited from three centers (training set: Institut Curie; test set: Institut Godinot and Institut Oscar Lambret). Post-NACI dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI scans from multiple vendors were analyzed. Radiologic complete response (rCR)-defined as no enhancement in the tumor bed-was evaluated for predicting pCR. A multivariable logistic regression model incorporating rCR, nodal involvement, and Ki-67 index was developed and externally validated. In cases with residual enhancement (non-rCR), a radiomic score using shape and first-order features was tested. Results A total of 175 women were included in the training set (mean age, 49 years ± 11 [SD]) and 84 women in the external test set (mean age, 52 years ± 12). The rCR at MRI was predictive of pCR, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.83 (95% CI: 0.75, 0.92). The combined model (rCR + nodal status + Ki-67) yielded an AUC of 0.88 (95% CI: 0.81, 0.96) in the test set. In node-negative patients with Ki-67 greater than 30%, the rCR false-discovery rate (ie, the proportion of rCR cases that were actually non-pCR or residual disease missed at breast MRI) was 3.6% (two of 56) in the training set and 3.5% (one of 29) in the test set; all cancers were limited to residual cancer burden I. In non-rCR cases, a model incorporating the radiomics score and lesion count achieved an AUC of 0.80 (95% CI: 0.69, 0.90). Conclusion Posttreatment rCR at MRI demonstrated strong predictive value for pCR in early TNBC following NACI. © RSNA, 2025 ",2005

Surveillance imaging plays an increasingly important role in the management of these children. The approach to imaging must account for several factors, including age of the child, onset and frequency of imaging, whether sedation is needed, and the types of tumors associated with a particular syndrome. Consideration must also be given to the potential risks and benefits associated with a given imaging technique. Whole-body MRI offers many advantages, including a comprehensive examination without ionizing radiation. Other techniques, such as CT, involve low doses of ionizing radiation but may be appropriate depending on the clinical circumstance.

American journal of roentgenology,2025,"As cancer therapies evolve and become increasingly targeted, the spectrum of treatment-related neurotoxicities presents a growing challenge. This Review highlights important neurotoxic complications associated with commonly used and emerging cancer therapies, emphasizing the critical role of neuroimaging in their detection and differentiation from disease progression and other entities. The specific entities considered include neurologic immune-related adverse events, immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome, and tumor inflammation-associated neurotoxicity. Imaging techniques, such as perfusion MRI, vessel wall imaging, and amino acid PET, are complementary in improving performance in diagnosing neurotoxicity syndromes and guiding timely clinical decision-making and intervention. A multidisciplinary approach integrating oncology, neurology, and imaging is crucial for balancing therapeutic benefits with neurotoxicity risk. Early recognition and intervention are essential; although many treatment-induced neurotoxicities are reversible, delayed diagnosis can result in long-term disability or even death. By recognizing characteristic imaging patterns, radiologists play a central role in identifying emerging treatment-related neurotoxicity syndromes, thereby supporting safe, high-quality, patient-centered cancer care.",1348

However, current models are limited in identifying small lesions and lack generalizability. Purpose To develop a generalizable deep learning system for detecting, segmenting, and longitudinally tracking BMs of any size at MRI. Materials and Methods In this retrospective study, a data-centric approach to deep learning model development was used. A multicenter dataset was collected, comprising pre- and/or posttreatment MRI scans from patients with BMs and MRI scans from patients with cancer without BMs (December 2015 to August 2023). Iterative data annotation by radiologists with systematic quality control increased the consistency of reference segmentations.

Purpose To evaluate the impact of contrast-enhanced mammography (CEM) on incremental cancer detection rate (ICDR), false-positive rate (FPR) due to recall, and positive predictive value of biopsies performed (PPV3) when added to digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) in women eligible for screening MRI. Materials and Methods From March 2021 to December 2022, 615 eligible women were prospectively recruited and consented to a single screening CEM examination with clinical DBT. Two radiologists interpreted each imaging study: Reader 1 recorded DBT findings first, and reader 2 recorded CEM findings first. Incremental cancer detection rate, cancer type and/or nodal status, FPR, PPV3, interval cancer rate, and areas under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUCs) based on forced Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System assessments were evaluated. Results Six hundred one women (mean age, 56 years [range: 30-75 years]) completed CEM. Twelve of the 601 women (2.0%) were diagnosed with 16 malignant lesions; cancers in five of the 12 women (42%) were detected by reader 1 at DBT, and one was detected at DBT by reader 2 (also seen on CEM by both observers). Cancers in the other six women were identified only with CEM (ICDR, six per 601 or 10.0 per 1000 women [95% CI: 3.3, 18.3]): five had invasive disease, all node negative, with a median lesion size of 0.7 cm (range: 0.4-1.1 cm); three were lobular.

Purpose To investigate the usefulness of repeat biopsy and a pediatric-specific biopsy cutoff incorporating risk factors to improve the diagnostic performance of the 2021 Korean Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System (K-TIRADS) and American College of Radiology Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System (ACR TI-RADS). Materials and Methods US images of biopsy-confirmed pediatric thyroid nodules obtained at Seoul National University Hospital between January 2010 and December 2021 were retrospectively analyzed. The diagnostic performance of the aforementioned systems with the incorporation of risk factors (Hashimoto thyroiditis, previous radiation therapy, family history of thyroid cancer, or hereditary tumor syndrome) was evaluated. The McNemar test and the weighted generalized score statistic were used. Results Two hundred patients (median age, 16 years [IQR, 13-18 years]; 153 female; 17 children [age, <10 years] and 183 adolescents [age, 10-19 years]; 92 with risk factors) with 223 nodules (142 malignant nodules [64% of total nodules; 86% of 166 resected nodules]) were analyzed. Repeat biopsies owing to large size, interval growth, or category 4 and 5 revealed that six of 21 nodules (29%) initially categorized as benign were malignant postoperatively.

40522404,Personalised prostate MRI: tailoring contrast medium use in an era of increasing demand.,European radiology,2025,"Prostate MRI has an established role in early diagnosis, staging, and active surveillance of prostate cancer (PCa), and its demand continues to rise. Moreover, the growing use of active surveillance for patients with low-risk and favourable intermediate-risk prostate cancer, along with ongoing research into MRI-based screening, is expected to further increase the need for MRI follow-up. Routine use of bi-parametric MRI and more selective, evidence-based administration of gadolinium contrast agents may help reduce the growing strain on MRI services. This special report explores scenarios in which contrast enhancement can improve diagnostic confidence, as well as situations where it may be safely omitted. It also examines the potential of on-table monitoring to guide patient-specific contrast administration, highlighting recent evidence suggesting this approach could reduce contrast use in three out of four men without compromising cancer detection or biopsy rates. Finally, the report outlines future research directions aimed at optimising scan times and contrast use in prostate cancer MRI. KEY POINTS: Question With the growing demand for prostate MRI, how can we optimise scanner and specialist time, minimise gadolinium use, and still maintain high diagnostic accuracy? Findings Syer et al demonstrate the feasibility of using on-table monitoring to reduce the number of contrast-enhanced prostate MRI exams by 76%, without compromising cancer detection or biopsy rates. Clinical relevance While promising, the effectiveness of on-table monitoring for guiding contrast-enhanced acquisitions requires further validation.

Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) screening has emerged as a powerful tool for early detection, enabling diagnosis at curable stages and reducing lung cancer mortality. Despite strong evidence, LDCT screening uptake remains suboptimal globally. This review synthesizes current evidence supporting LDCT screening, highlights ongoing global implementation efforts, and discusses key insights from the 1st AGILE conference. Lung cancer screening is gaining global momentum, with many countries advancing plans for national LDCT programs. Expanding eligibility through risk-based models and targeting high-risk never- and light-smokers are emerging strategies to improve efficiency and equity. Technological advancements, including AI-assisted interpretation and image-based biomarkers, are addressing concerns around false positives, overdiagnosis, and workforce burden. Integrating cardiac and smoking-related disease assessment within LDCT screening offers added preventive health benefits. To maximize global impact, screening strategies must be tailored to local health systems and populations. Efforts should focus on increasing awareness, standardizing protocols, optimizing screening intervals, and strengthening multidisciplinary care pathways. International collaboration and shared infrastructure can accelerate progress and ensure sustainability.

In vitro, BTE binding and accumulation were evaluated in glioma neurospheres. In in vivo studies, the BTEs labeled with either iodine-124 using residualizing chemistry or conjugated to Cy5 were used for longitudinal tracking in patient-derived xenograft models of GBM using PET/CT and confocal microscopy. The survival analysis in mice bearing intracranial GBM tumors was conducted to validate the findings from imaging studies. In vitro, the BTE demonstrated target-specific binding and accumulation in IL-13 receptor α-2-expressing glioma spheres. In vivo, PET/CT imaging revealed that the BTE reached the tumor site within 3 hours after injection, achieving up to 4.8% ID/g, with sustained tumor retention for up to 24 hours, significantly higher than background levels in surrounding normal brain tissue. Confocal microscopy confirmed BTE presence in the tumor bed extravascular space with evidence of T cell-mediated BTE transport across the blood-tumor barrier. Despite its short plasma half-life, the BTE remained in the tumor microenvironment for at least 24 hours. Mice bearing GBM6 brain tumors treated with BTE for 3 to 4 days apart via the intravenous route showed a significant survival advantage over the control group. Our findings provide critical insights into the pharmacokinetics of BTE molecules in GBM. They demonstrate effective penetration and prolonged intratumoral retention following a single systemic dose, supporting further exploration of BTE treatment regimens for translation to clinical settings.",1803
40495423,Solid Stress Estimations via Intraoperative 3D Navigation in Patients with Brain Tumors.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,2025,"Physical forces exerted by expanding brain tumors-specifically the compressive stresses propagated through solid tissue structures-reduce brain perfusion and neurologic function but heretofore have not been directly measured in patients in vivo. Solid stress levels estimated from tumor growth patterns are negatively correlated with neurologic performance in patients. We hypothesize that measurements of solid stress can be used to inform clinical management of brain tumors. We developed an intraoperative technique to quantitatively estimate solid stress and brain replacement by the tumor. In 30 patients, we made topographic measurements of brain deformation through the craniotomy site with a neuronavigation system during surgical workflows immediately preceding tumor resection (<5 minutes in the operating room). Utilizing these measurements in conjunction with finite element modeling, we calculated solid stress within the tumor and brain and estimated the amount of brain tissue replaced, i.e., lost, by tumor growth. Mean solid stresses were in the range of 10 to 600 Pa, and the amount of tissue replacement was up to 10% of the brain. Brain loss in patients delineated glioblastoma from brain metastatic tumors, and in mice, solid stress was a sensitive biomarker of chemotherapy response. We present in this study a quantitative approach to intraoperatively measure solid stress in patients that can be readily adopted into standard clinical workflows. Brain loss due to tumor growth is a novel mechanical-based biomarker that, in addition to solid stress, may inform personalized management in future clinical studies in brain cancer.",1652

40480552,Enhanced risk stratification for stage II colorectal cancer using deep learning-based CT classifier and pathological markers to optimize adjuvant therapy decision.,Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology,2025,"Current risk stratification for stage II colorectal cancer (CRC) has limited accuracy in identifying patients who would benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy, leading to potential overtreatment or undertreatment. We aimed to develop a more precise risk stratification system by integrating artificial intelligence-based imaging analysis with pathological markers. We analyzed 2992 stage II CRC patients from 12 centers. A deep learning classifier (Swin Transformer Assisted Risk-stratification for CRC, STAR-CRC) was developed using multi-planar computed tomography (CT) images from 1587 patients (training : internal validation = 7 : 3) and validated in 1405 patients from eight independent centers, which stratified patients into low-, uncertain-, and high-risk groups. To further refine the uncertain-risk group, a composite score based on pathological markers (pT4 stage, number of lymph nodes sampled, perineural invasion, and lymphovascular invasion) was applied, forming the Intelligent Risk Integration System for stage II Colorectal Cancer (IRIS-CRC). IRIS-CRC was compared against the guideline-based risk stratification system (GRSS-CRC) for prediction performance and validated in the validation dataset. IRIS-CRC stratified patients into four prognostic groups with distinct 3-year disease-free survival rates (≥95%, 95%-75%, 75%-55%, ≤55%). Upon external validation, compared with GRSS-CRC, IRIS-CRC downstaged 27.1% of high-risk patients into the favorable group, and upstaged 6.5% of low-risk patients into the very poor prognosis group who might require more aggressive treatment. In the GRSS-CRC intermediate-risk group of the external validation dataset, IRIS-CRC reclassified 40.1% as favorable prognosis and 7.0% as very poor prognosis. IRIS-CRC's performance maintained generalizability in both chemotherapy and non-chemotherapy cohorts. IRIS-CRC offers a more precise and personalized risk assessment than current guideline-based risk factors, potentially sparing low-risk patients from unnecessary adjuvant chemotherapy while identifying high-risk individuals for more aggressive treatment. This novel approach holds promise for improving clinical decision-making and outcomes in stage II CRC.",2214
40459419,Adaptive Breast MRI Scanning Using AI.,Radiology,2025,"Background MRI protocols typically involve many imaging sequences and often require too much time. Purpose To simulate artificial intelligence (AI)-directed stratified scanning for screening breast MRI with various triage thresholds and evaluate its diagnostic performance against that of the full breast MRI protocol. Materials and Methods This retrospective reader study included consecutive contrast-enhanced screening breast MRI examinations performed between January 2013 and January 2019 at three regional cancer sites. In this simulation study, an in-house AI tool generated a suspicion score for subtraction maximum intensity projection images during a given MRI examination, and the score was used to determine whether to proceed with the full MRI protocol or end the examination early (abbreviated breast MRI [AB-MRI] protocol). Examinations with suspicion scores under the 50th percentile were read using both the AB-MRI protocol (ie, dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI scans only) and the full MRI protocol. Diagnostic performance metrics for screening with various AI triage thresholds were compared with those for screening without AI triage. Results Of 863 women (mean age, 52 years ± 10 [SD]; 1423 MRI examinations), 51 received a cancer diagnosis within 12 months of screening. The diagnostic performance metrics for AI-directed stratified scanning that triaged 50% of examinations to AB-MRI versus full MRI protocol scanning were as follows: sensitivity, 88.2% (45 of 51; 95% CI: 79.4, 97.1) versus 86.3% (44 of 51; 95% CI: 76.8, 95.7); specificity, 80.8% (1108 of 1372; 95% CI: 78.7, 82.8) versus 81.4% (1117 of 1372; 95% CI: 79.4, 83.5); positive predictive value 3 (ie, percent of biopsies yielding cancer), 23.6% (43 of 182; 95% CI: 17.5, 29.8) versus 24.7% (42 of 170; 95% CI: 18.2, 31.2); cancer detection rate (per 1000 examinations), 31.6 (95% CI: 22.5, 40.7) versus 30.9 (95% CI: 21.9, 39.9); and interval cancer rate (per 1000 examinations), 4.2 (95% CI: 0.9, 7.6) versus 4.9 (95% CI: 1.3, 8.6). Specificity decreased by no more than 2.7 percentage points with AI triage. There were no AI-triaged examinations for which conducting the full MRI protocol would have resulted in additional cancer detection.

To compare the performance of DBT and DM screening in women with a family history of breast cancer overall and subdivided by breast cancer family history category, breast density, age group, screening interval, and screening round, and to describe characteristics of cancers detected on screening vs interval cancers. In this comparative cohort study at imaging facilities affiliated with the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium, adult women 18 years and older with a self-reported family history of breast cancer who underwent DBT or DM from 2011 to 2018 were included, with a 1-year follow-up for breast carcinoma. Data analysis was performed between November 2023 and August 2024. DBT or DM. The main outcomes were absolute risk difference (ARD) between DBT and DM for recall rate, cancer detection rate, interval cancer rate, advanced cancer rate, biopsy rate, positive predictive values, sensitivity, and specificity, with inverse probability of treatment weighting. A total of 208 945 women with a family history of breast cancer undergoing 502 357 screening examinations were included in the sample. Median (IQR) age was 58 (50-66) and 57 (49-66) years for the DBT and DM groups, respectively. Adjusted ARDs (DBT vs DM) were significant for recall rate (-1.51%; 95% CI, -2.42% to -0.59%) and specificity (1.56%; 95% CI, 0.65%-2.46%) in the overall cohort of 121 698 DBT and 380 561 DM examinations and among women with 1 first-degree relative (recall rate ARD, -1.72%; 95% CI, -2.70% to -0.74%; specificity ARD, 1.75%; 95% CI, 0.81%-2.69%). Among those with only second-degree relatives, the biopsy rate for DBT was significantly higher (ARD, 0.39%; 95% CI, 0.18%-0.61%).

The Dense Tissue and Early Breast Neoplasm Screening (DENSE) trial provides an opportunity to study this protocol in a true screening population. Purpose To compare multireader diagnostic accuracy of various abbreviated screening breast MRI protocols with that of the full multiparametric protocol in the DENSE trial, focusing on identifying the minimal protocol necessary to maintain high diagnostic accuracy. Materials and Methods In this secondary analysis of a subset from the DENSE trial, seven radiologists performed incremental readings of first-round screening MRI scans in women with extremely dense breasts and findings negative for cancer at mammography. Different sequences were added in four incremental steps. The first step included both high-temporal low-spatial and low-temporal high-spatial dynamic T1-weighted series, up to 120 seconds after contrast agent injection.

This study included 568 patients from four centers with confirmed SIP (n = 421) and SIP-SCC (n = 147). Deep learning models were built using T1WI, T2WI, and CE-T1WI. A combined model was constructed by integrating these features through an attention mechanism. The diagnostic performance of radiologists, both with and without the model's assistance, was compared. Model performance was evaluated through receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, calibration curves, and decision curve analysis (DCA). The combined model demonstrated superior performance in differentiating SIP from SIP-SCC, achieving AUCs of 0.954, 0.897, and 0.859 in the training, internal validation, and external validation cohorts, respectively. It showed optimal accuracy, stability, and clinical benefit, as confirmed by Brier scores and calibration curves. The diagnostic performance of radiologists, especially for less experienced ones, was significantly improved with model assistance. The MRI-based deep learning model enhances the capability to predict malignant transformation of sinonasal inverted papilloma before surgery. By facilitating earlier diagnosis and promoting timely pathological examination or surgical intervention, this approach holds the potential to enhance patient prognosis. Questions Sinonasal inverted papilloma (SIP) is prone to malignant transformation locally, leading to poor prognosis; current diagnostic methods are invasive and inaccurate, necessitating effective preoperative differentiation. Findings The MRI-based deep learning model accurately diagnoses malignant transformations of SIP, enabling junior radiologists to achieve greater clinical benefits with the assistance of the model.

In preclinical studies, NK224 was labeled with 68Ga. Small-animal PET, biodistribution, and blocking studies were performed using tumor models with varying PD-L1 expression levels to assess the targeting ability and specificity of 68Ga-NK224 in vivo. Serial 68Ga-NK224 PET assessed target occupancy following PD-L1 antibody administration. In the clinical study, 37 patients with non-small cell lung cancer who underwent 68Ga-NK224 PET/CT were prospectively recruited, with PD-L1 expression assessed via IHC and analyzed for correlation with 68Ga-NK224 uptake. Preclinical studies demonstrated that 68Ga-NK224 exhibited high tumor uptake and rapid clearance, producing favorable tumor-to-background contrast. In human CD34+ humanized mice, immunotherapy guided by 68Ga-NK224 PET/CT (once weekly) yielded similar antitumor effects as conventional dosing (three times weekly). Clinically, 68Ga-NK224 PET/CT was well tolerated, with no adverse events reported. Among the 31 patients who underwent paired 68Ga-NK224 and 2[18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose PET/CT, the tumor uptake of 68Ga-NK224 significantly correlated with PD-L1 expression, whereas no correlation was found with 2[18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose PET/CT. Additionally, 68Ga-NK224 demonstrated high heterogeneity across intrapatient lesions, with a median maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) coefficient of variation of 27.5% (range, 5.7%-53.2%). 68Ga-NK224 provides a straightforward radiolabeling approach with high tumor-to-background contrast, enabling an accurate assessment of PD-L1 expression and visualization of heterogeneity across intrapatient lesions. Its ability to dynamically monitor PD-L1 occupancy in tumors offers a novel method for optimizing immunotherapy dosing regimens.",1995

Oncology,2025,"Various locoregional treatments exist for PET-CT-detected pelvic nodal oligorecurrences in patients with prostate cancer. We aimed to assess whether elective nodal radiotherapy (ENRT) to the pelvis would be superior to metastasis-directed therapy (MDT). PEACE V-STORM is a phase 2, open-label, randomised, controlled trial conducted in 21 hospitals in Australia, Belgium, Italy, Norway, Spain, and Switzerland. Eligible participants were aged 18 years or older, with WHO performance status 0-1 and a histologically confirmed initial diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the prostate, with a PET-detected pelvic nodal oligorecurrence (up to five nodes) following radical local treatment. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to MDT or ENRT. Randomisation was done online by minimisation with randomisation factor 0·80 and was stratified by type of PET tracer (choline vs prostate-specific membrane antigen) and type of MDT used (salvage lymph node dissection vs stereotactic body radiotherapy or simultaneous integrated boost). Participants and researchers were not masked to treatment assignment. Patients in the MDT group had salvage lymph node dissection or stereotactic body radiotherapy (30 Gy in three fractions every other day), with 6 months of androgen deprivation therapy. Patients in the ENRT group received a 45 Gy dose in 25 fractions to the pelvis with a simultaneous integrated boost of 65 Gy to the PET-positive nodes or salvage lymph node dissection, with 6 months of androgen deprivation therapy. The primary endpoint was metastasis-free survival, defined as the time between randomisation and the appearance of a metastatic recurrence (any M1) on PET imaging or death due to any cause, and was analysed per modified intention to treat. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03569241, and the Swiss National Clinical Trials Portal, SNCTP000002947, and is active, not recruiting. Between June 11, 2018, and April 30, 2021, 198 patients were screened for eligibility, 196 of whom were randomly assigned to MDT (n=99) or ENRT (n=97), with 190 evaluable patients (MDT n=97 and ENRT n=93). All patients were male. Data on race and ethnicity were not collected. Median follow-up was 50 months (IQR 42-58). 4-year metastasis-free survival was 63% (80% CI 56-69) in the MDT group and 76% (69-81) in the ENRT group (HR 0·62 [80% CI 0·44-0·86]; p=0·063). The most common grade 3 adverse events were urinary incontinence (six [6%] of 97 in the MDT group vs nine [10%] in the ENRT group) and diarrhoea (one [1%] in the MDT group vs two [2%] in the ENRT group). No treatment-related deaths occurred. To our knowledge, this is the first randomised trial for metachronous PET-detected nodal recurrences comparing two local treatment approaches (MDT and ENRT) in combination with 6 months of androgen deprivation therapy. By showing an improved metastasis-free survival with ENRT, this trial establishes ENRT as a potential standard treatment approach, awaiting a phase 3 trial confirming these results.

However, published studies systematically penalized standard dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI because they integrated ultrafast MRI into existing DCE protocols, such that postcontrast acquisitions of DCE MRI began only after completion of ultrafast MRI. Purpose To perform an intraindividual comparison of conspicuity and classification of enhancing breast lesions with ultrafast MRI versus standard DCE MRI, where both methods included the early postcontrast phase. Materials and Methods This was a retrospective analysis of 31 women (median age, 48 years [IQR, 39-51 years]) from September 2021 to January 2023. Women underwent DCE MRI at 1.5 T and, within 2 days, a second contrast-enhanced examination using ultrafast MRI, for further diagnostic assessment of difficult-to-interpret enhancing lesions and/or BPE. For DCE MRI, a two-dimensional gradient-echo series (0.61 × 0.61 × 3.0-mm spatial resolution, 60 seconds per dynamic frame) was obtained once before and four times after injection of 0.1 mmol/kg gadobutrol. For ultrafast MRI, a compressed-sense accelerated three-dimensional gradient-echo series (0.92 × 0.97 × 2.5-mm spatial resolution, 4 seconds per keyhole dynamic frame) was obtained over 90 seconds before, during, and after injection of 0.1 mmol/kg gadobutrol. Two breast radiologists independently rated BPE, image quality, and conspicuity and morphology of enhancing lesions, and enhancement kinetics were analyzed (ultrafast MRI: maximum slope and time to enhancement; DCE MRI: wash-in rate and time course pattern). Results A total 59 enhancing lesions were reported in the 62 breasts of the 31 patients. BPE ratings were on average 0.8 points lower at ultrafast versus DCE MRI (mean, 2.5 ± 1.2 [SD] vs 3.3 ± 1.2; ",1939

However, current approaches to evaluate LNM and OS have limited accuracy. In this study, we used longitudinal CT images from 1,021 patients with locally advanced gastric cancer to develop and validate a multitask deep learning model, named co-attention tri-oriented spatial Mamba (CTSMamba), to simultaneously predict LNM and OS. CTSMamba was trained and validated on 398 patients, and the performance was further validated on 623 patients at two additional centers. Notably, CTSMamba exhibited significantly more robust performance than a clinical model in predicting LNM across all of the cohorts. Additionally, integrating CTSMamba survival scores with clinical predictors further improved personalized OS prediction. These results support the potential of CTSMamba to accurately predict LNM and OS from longitudinal images, potentially providing clinicians with a tool to inform individualized treatment approaches and optimized prognostic strategies. CTSMamba is a multitask deep learning model trained on longitudinal CT images of neoadjuvant chemotherapy-treated locally advanced gastric cancer that accurately predicts lymph node metastasis and overall survival to inform clinical decision-making.

40299851,Integrating ctDNA Analysis and Radiomics for Dynamic Risk Assessment in Localized Lung Cancer.,Cancer discovery,2025,"The complementarity and clinical utility of combining liquid biopsies and radiomic image analysis has not been demonstrated. ctDNA minimal residual disease after chemoradiotherapy (CRT) for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is highly prognostic, but on-treatment biomarkers are needed to enable response-adapted therapies. In this study, we analyzed 418 patients with NSCLC undergoing CRT to develop and validate a novel dynamic risk model that accurately predicts ultimate progression-free survival during treatment. We optimize tissue-free variant calling from plasma samples to facilitate ctDNA monitoring and demonstrate the importance of accounting for persistent clonal hematopoiesis variants. We show that mid-CRT ctDNA concentration is prognostic for disease progression and integrate additional pre-CRT risk factors, including radiomics, into a combined model that improves outcome prediction. Our results suggest that tumor features, radiomics, and mid-CRT ctDNA analysis are complementary and can identify patients at high and low risk of progression to potentially enable response-adapted therapies. This study demonstrates that combining tumor features, radiomics, and ctDNA analysis improves outcome prediction in NSCLC treated with CRT therapy. Our integrated model could enable personalized and response-adapted therapies to reduce toxicity and improve outcomes in patients. See related commentary by Anagnostou and Aggarwal, p. 1534.",1451

40287872,Detection rates for prostate cancer using PI-RADS 2.1 upgrading rules in transition zone lesions align with risk assessment categories: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,European radiology,2025,"To evaluate and compare cancer detection rates (CDRs) of transition zone (TZ) lesions upgraded from PI-RADSv2.1 score 2 to 3 (""2 + 1"") or from 3 to 4 (""3 + 1"") using DWI and assess their clinical impact. A systematic literature search was performed in Embase, Medline, and Web of Science for studies assessing TZ lesions with DWI in PI-RADSv2.1, with histology-confirmed grade group ≥ 2 cancer (GG ≥ 2) as the primary outcome. Risk of bias was evaluated using QUADAS-2. Pooled sensitivity, specificity, CDRs, and odds ratios (ORs) were estimated at the lesion level using a bivariate binomial random-effects model. Eight studies with 1535 TZ lesions were included. GG ≥ 2 CDRs for PI-RADS scores of 1, 2, 2 + 1, 3, 3 + 1, 4, and 5 were 2% (95%CI: 0%-12%), 6% (4%-10%), 13% (6%-23%), 19% (15%-25%), 37% (24%-52%), 49% (32%-67%), and 73% (66%-79%), respectively. Scores of 2 + 1 had higher GG ≥ 2 CDRs than 2 (OR 3.37 (1.53-7.44), p = 0.003) but were similar to 3 (OR 0.80 (0.44-1.45), p = 0.46). Scores of 3 + 1 had higher GG ≥ 2 CDRs than 3 (OR 2.67 (1.27-5.59), p = 0.009) but were similar to 4 (OR 0.68 (0.33-1.44), p = 0.32). False-positive rates remained substantial (≥ 2 + 1: 69% (55%-80%); ≥ 3: 54% (46%-62%)). The risk of having significant prostate cancer in ""2 + 1"" and ""3 + 1"" TZ lesions, with an upgrading based on DWI images, is appropriately categorized within the PI-RADS v2.1 scoring system, as shown by this meta-analysis. Question PI-RADS v2.1 incorporates rules allowing scores of some transition zone (TZ) lesions to be increased. Literature on the clinical impact of these rules is scarce. Findings For TZ lesions upgraded with DWI: ""2 + 1"" lesions show a cancer detection rate (CDR) of 13%, and ""3 + 1"" lesions show a CDR of 37%. Clinical relevance Upgraded TZ lesions may impact individualized biopsy-decisions, especially as ""3 + 1"" lesions harbor significant disease in 2-out-of-5 patients. Still, the high rate of grade group = 1 and benign findings in these sub-categories emphasizes the need for strategies to minimize overdiagnosis.",2060
40285816,Diagnostic yield of thyroid CT in differentiated thyroid carcinoma according to treatment response.,European radiology,2025,"To evaluate the diagnostic yield of thyroid CT in patients with post-treatment differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC) stratified by treatment response. This retrospective study included DTC patients who underwent total thyroidectomy and radioactive iodine ablation, followed by thyroid CT. Patients were categorized into response assessment groups according to the American Thyroid Association guidelines: excellent response (ER), biochemical incomplete response (BIR), indeterminate response (IR), and structural incomplete response (SIR). Diagnostic yield was defined as the proportion of patients with recurrent tumors among all patients. The yields of ER, BIR, and IR were compared. For IR, subgroup analyses were performed based on the presence of indeterminate lesions on ultrasound (US). Chi-squared tests with Bonferroni correction were used to compare the diagnostic yields between groups. A total of 450 patients (mean age, 44.9 ± 13.4 years; 164 men) were included. The overall diagnostic yield of thyroid CT was 15.3% (69/450; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 12.3-19%). Yields for the ER, BIR, and IR groups were 2% (4/201; 95% CI: 0.6-5.2%), 23.1% (12/52; 95% CI: 13.6-36.3%), and 26.9% (53/197; 95% CI: 21.2-33.5%), respectively. Among IR patients, the yield was significantly lower in US-negative patients (7.5%, 7/93; 95% CI: 3.5-15%) compared to those with indeterminate US lesions (44.2%, 46/104; 95% CI: 35.1-53.8%) (p < 0.001). The diagnostic yield of thyroid CT varies according to the treatment response; it was low in ER and US-negative IR but higher in BIR and IR with indeterminate US lesions. Question Guidelines recommend considering CT for follow-up in DTC based on treatment response, but the diagnostic yield of CT remains underexplored. Findings The diagnostic yield of CT was low in an ER and US-negative IR but higher in BIR and US-positive IR. Clinical relevance The diagnostic yield of thyroid CT varies according to treatment response. Utilizing CT based on treatment response may enhance the detection of recurrent tumors or clarify unclear findings on US.",2091
40285814,MR imaging and cholangiography show suboptimal performance for diagnosing ductal cholangiocarcinoma in primary sclerosing cholangitis patients.,European radiology,2025,"Our purpose was to evaluate the performance of MR imaging/cholangiography for ductal cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) diagnosis and to search for specific MR features of ductal CCA among primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) patients. We retrospectively analyzed 31 patients from a single center, each with a diagnosis of PSC, and suspicion of ductal CCA. Ductal CCA had been suspected during multidisciplinary team meetings when high-grade biliary stenosis was associated with focal thickening of the biliary wall. Two radiologists blinded to clinical information and imaging history independently reviewed patients' MR examinations using a standardized model created for this study. Fisher's exact test and Student's t-test were used to analyze the population's characteristics. Fisher's exact test and the chi-square test were used to compare associations of categorical variables (each standard model's item) with the final diagnosis. Interobserver agreement was assessed by Cohen's κ coefficient. Our population had a mean age of 42.7 ± 13.6 years and included 68% males. The final diagnosis was ductal CCA for 14 patients, and inflammatory stenosis for 17 patients. For diagnosing CCA, MR imaging/cholangiography exhibited a sensitivity of 43-50% and specificity of 70-76%, with low positive predictive (58-60%) and negative predictive (62-63%) values. Interobserver agreement ranged from κ = 0.04-0.75. Univariate analysis revealed no significant association between individual MR imaging/cholangiography features and CCA diagnosis. MR imaging/cholangiography showed suboptimal performance for ductal CCA diagnosis among PSC patients and we did not find any specific feature to distinguish ductal CCA from inflammatory stenosis. Question Diagnosing ductal cholangiocarcinoma in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis remains challenging without known predictive MR imaging features. Findings MR imaging/cholangiography exhibited low sensitivity, specificity, and interobserver reliability for ductal cholangiocarcinoma diagnosis in primary sclerosing cholangitis and lacks reliability for distinguishing between benign and malignant strictures. Clinical relevance Diagnosing ductal cholangiocarcinoma in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis remains challenging and our retrospective study demonstrates that MR imaging lacks reliability in distinguishing between benign and malignant high-grade strictures and did not find any specific MR feature of ductal CCA.",2472
40278873,Sequential dual-energy CT for longitudinal assessment of pathologic response to neoadjuvant immuno-chemotherapy in locally advanced gastric cancer.,European radiology,2025,"To longitudinally evaluate pathologic response outcomes after neoadjuvant immuno-chemotherapy (NICT) for patients with locally advanced gastric cancer (LAGC) using pre- and post-treatment dual-energy CT (DECT). Between Jan 2021 and Dec 2023, 115 patients who underwent NICT plus gastrectomy and triple-phase enhanced DECT scans before and after NICT were retrospectively enrolled. Pathologic tumor regression grade (TRG) was the reference standard, patients were labelled as responders (TRG = 0 + 1) and non-responders (TRG = 2 + 3) accordingly. A two-dimensional free-hand region of interest method was adopted to obtain the iodine concentration (IC) values. Pre- and post-NICT IC and normalized IC (nIC) were measured at arterial/venous/delay phase (AP/VP/DP), respectively; their changes [ΔIC (%)] defined as (IC_post-IC_pre)⁄IC_pre × 100% were calculated. Pre- and post-NICT imaging parameters and their changes were compared between different response groups. Non-responders' associated parameters were selected using multivariable logistic regression analysis. Their performances were analyzed by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Their associations with patient survival were explored by using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. ICDP-pre, ΔICAP, thickness-post with cut-off value of > 2.306 mg/mL, ≤ 26.70%, > 18.5 mm, respectively, indicates non-responders with equivalent AUC being 0.616 (95% CI: 0.521-0.705), 0.625 (95% CI: 0.529-0.713), and 0.660 (95% CI: 0.565-0.745). Their combination demonstrated an improved AUC of 0.774 (95% CI: 0.686-0.846) and was associated with patient disease-free survival (DFS) with a hazard ratio being 2.239 (95% CI: 1.004-4.991) (p = 0.026). Pre- and post-NICT DECT-based quantifications are useful for longitudinal assessment of pathologic response outcomes after NICT in LAGC. ICDP-pre, ΔICAP, and thickness-post are equally useful, their combination demonstrated incremental benefit. Question Accurate evaluation of the efficacy of NICT in patients with LAGC remains challenging due to the lack of effective biomarkers. Findings Sequential DECT-based ICDP-pre, ΔICAP, and tumor thickness-post were predictive of TRG status. Their combination demonstrated enhanced performance and was associated with patient DFS. Clinical relevance DECT represents a promising imaging technique with added advantages for longitudinal assessment of pathologic response to NICT in LAGC, potentially facilitating more personalized treatment strategies among this population.",2531
40272491,Preoperative breast MRI for invasive ductal carcinoma with or without a DCIS component at needle biopsy: influence on surgical outcomes in the MIPA study.,European radiology,2025,"To analyse the impact of preoperative breast MRI on surgical outcomes of patients diagnosed with pure invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) or IDC with an associated in situ component (IDC + ductal carcinoma in situ [DCIS]) at needle biopsy. Patients aged 18-80 years referred for upfront surgery after a diagnosis of pure IDC or IDC + DCIS at needle biopsy were retrieved from the Multicenter International Prospective Analysis (MIPA) database. In each subgroup, patients who underwent preoperative MRI (MRI groups) were matched 1:1 to those who did not (noMRI groups) according to eight confounding covariates. Surgical outcomes were compared with non-parametric statistics after calculating odds ratios (ORs). Among 1051 patients with IDC + DCIS, 510 were retained after matching (255 in each group): in comparison to the noMRI group, the MRI group had significantly higher rates of first-line mastectomy (13.3% vs 6.3%; OR 2.30, p = 0.011) and of overall mastectomy (14.5% vs 7.5%; OR 2.11, p = 0.016), without significantly lowering the reoperation rate (9.4% vs 10.6%, OR 0.88, p = 0.768). Among 2459 patients with pure IDC, 1638 were retained after matching (819 in each group): the first-line mastectomy rate was not significantly higher in the MRI group (12.9% vs 12.1% in the noMRI group; OR 1.08, p = 0.654). Instead, the reoperation rate was significantly lower (2.6% vs 7.9%; OR 3.28 for avoiding reoperation, p < 0.001) with no increase in overall mastectomies (13.6% vs 13.7%: OR 0.99, p = 1.000). In patients with IDC + DCIS, preoperative MRI did not reduce reoperations and increased mastectomies. Conversely, in patients with pure IDC, preoperative MRI reduced reoperations without increasing mastectomies. Question The impact of preoperative breast MRI on surgical outcomes of patients with IDC at needle biopsy is controversial and lacks large-scale investigations. Findings For pure IDC at needle biopsy, MRI reduced reoperations without increasing mastectomies; for IDC + DCIS, MRI did not reduce reoperations and increased mastectomies. Clinical relevance In patients with IDC at needle biopsy, the decision to perform preoperative breast MRI should take into account the presence of associated DCIS, as the benefits of MRI on surgical outcomes were observed only in patients with pure IDC.",2307
40272490,Intravoxel incoherent motion-derived histogram analysis for quantitative evaluation of tumor budding and prognostic stratification in rectal cancer.,European radiology,2025,"To determine the value of intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) for quantitative tumor budding (TB) evaluation and prognostic stratification in patients with rectal cancer (RC). This study enrolled 189 RC patients (training set 148, validation set 41) who underwent IVIM and were subsequently treated surgically within 2 weeks between January 2022 and April 2023. Hematoxylin-eosin staining was used for TB scoring. IVIM metrics were calculated on MRI images using biexponential fitting and histogram analysis. Differences in IVIM histogram metrics between the low-intermediate grade budding (Bd 1 + 2) and the high-grade budding (Bd 3) were analyzed. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to build the Combined model. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was used to assess the diagnostic performance of the IVIM histogram metrics and the Combined model. Kaplan-Meier analysis was employed to estimate disease-free and overall survival rates for patients. Multivariate logistic analysis showed that the D_25th percentile, D_75th percentile, D_90th percentile, and D_95th percentile were independent predictors of Bd 3 (all p < 0.05). The Combined model incorporating these four factors had the best diagnostic performance, with the AUC, sensitivity, and specificity of 0.852, 73.02%, and 82.35% in the training set and 0.856, 75.00%, and 86.21% in the validation set. Furthermore, the score of the Combined model was significantly associated with worse 2-year overall survival (hazard ratio 6.804, 95% confidence interval 2.214 to 20.909, p = 0.001). The IVIM histogram metrics could distinguish different TB grades and be used as a preoperative risk stratification tool. Questions Does intravoxel incoherent motion based on histogram analysis predict tumor budding grades and its prognosis in patients with rectal cancer? Findings The histogram metrics of slow diffusion coefficient are an independent prediction factor of high-grade tumor budding and a risk factor of poor 2-year overall survival. Clinical relevance This combined model, based on slow diffusion coefficient, is a reliable tool for preoperative predicting 2-year overall survival in patients with rectal cancer, contributing to risk stratification and individual treatment.",2281
40272489,Reduction of biopsy rate in BI-RADS4 breast lesions: potential of an abbreviated advanced DWI protocol.,European radiology,2025,"This study compared the diagnostic performance of diffusion biomarkers estimated from an abbreviated diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) protocol and assessed their potential to reduce unnecessary biopsies of benign BI-RADS 4 lesions identified on dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI. A retrospective study was conducted from 2019 to 2023. All patients underwent abbreviated DWI at 3 T with four b-values (0 s/mm In total, 168 female patients (mean age ± standard deviation, 56.2 ± 13.5 years) with 178 BI-RADS 4 lesions on DCE MRI were analyzed. The median ADC Diffusion MRI biomarkers obtained using an abbreviated DWI protocol reduced unnecessary biopsies in BI-RADS 4 lesions, with K performing slightly better than ADC. Question MRI BI-RADS category 4 includes a substantial number of benign lesions, and reducing unnecessary biopsies remains a critical clinical concern. Findings The parameters from abbreviated DWI show lesion differentiation comparable to ADC and have greater potential to reduce unnecessary biopsies. Clinical relevance This study underscores the potential of imaging biomarkers from abbreviated DWI for assessing breast MRI BI-RADS 4 lesions. These biomarkers may be comparable or superior to standard ADC in reducing unnecessary biopsies and could aid in improving patient management decisions.",1319

40261172,2024 International Expert Consensus on US-guided Thermal Ablation for T1N0M0 Papillary Thyroid Cancer.,Radiology,2025,"Thermal ablation has started to gain acceptance as a therapeutic approach for the management of papillary thyroid cancer (PTC), mainly in the T1 stage (tumor size ≤ 2 cm in greatest dimension and limited to the thyroid). Despite its increasing popularity, a lack of uniformity in the technical details persists, and existing guidelines do not fully align with recent research advancements. To standardize the use of US-guided thermal ablation for T1N0M0 PTC, a panel of experts jointly issued this expert consensus on thermal ablation for PTC. This consensus was developed by experts with specific competence and expertise in this field through rounds of the modified Delphi method. An evidence-based approach incorporating the practical experience of the panelists was adopted. The consensus was developed through extensive discussions, systematic literature review with meta-analysis, and expert evaluations. In this consensus, a total of 27 recommendations are made, addressing the indications and contraindications for thermal ablation for PTC, physician training, preoperative preparation, technical procedures, complications, efficacy assessment, and follow-up strategies. This expert consensus provides up-to-date, high-quality, standardized guidance to harmonize treatment practices, enhance patient outcomes, and potentially shape future research and policy developments in the management of T1N0M0 PTC using US-guided thermal ablation.",1445
40260640,Multimetric MRI Captures Early Response and Acquired Resistance of Pancreatic Cancer to KRAS Inhibitor Therapy.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,2025,"In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS) mutations drive both cancer cell growth and formation of a dense stroma. Small-molecule KRAS inhibitors (KRASi) represent a promising new class of therapy for PDAC; hence, clinical tools that can assess early response, detect resistance, and/or predict prolonged survival are desirable to understand clinical biology of KRASi. We hypothesized that diffusion-weighted MRI can detect cell death, whereas dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI and magnetization transfer ratio imaging are sensitive to tumor microenvironment changes, and these metrics shed insights into tumor size change induced by KRASi treatment. Multiple preclinical PDAC models, including a genetically engineered mouse model (KPC), received MRTX1133, a KRASi specific for KRASG12D mutation. Quantitative imaging markers were corroborated with IHC analyses. A significant increase in tumor apparent diffusion coefficient (a diffusion-weighted MRI metric) was detected as early as 48 hours and persisted to day 7 after the initiation of KRASi treatment and was strongly correlated with cell death and reduced cellularity, resulting in greatly prolonged median survival in treated mice. Capillary perfusion/permeability (a dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI metric) exhibited an inverse relationship with microvascular density. Distinct responses of KRASG12C versus KRASG12D tumors to MRTX1133 were captured by the MRI metrics corroborated with IHC. When tumors developed resistance to MRTX1133, the imaging marker values exhibited a reversal from those of responding tumors. Multiparametric MRI provides early biological insights of cancer and stromal responses to KRASi treatment and sets the stage for testing the utility of these clinically ready MRI methods in patients receiving KRASi therapy.",1846
40252095,Deep learning enhances reliability of dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI in diffuse gliomas: bypassing post-processing and providing uncertainty maps.,European radiology,2025,"To propose and evaluate a novel deep learning model for directly estimating pharmacokinetic (PK) parameter maps and uncertainty estimation from DCE-MRI. In this single-center study, patients with adult-type diffuse gliomas who underwent preoperative DCE-MRI from Apr 2010 to Feb 2020 were retrospectively enrolled. A spatiotemporal probabilistic model was used to create synthetic PK maps. Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) to ground truth (GT) maps were calculated. Reliability was evaluated using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) for synthetic and GT PK maps. For clinical validation, Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUROC) was obtained for predicting WHO low vs high grade and IDH-wildtype vs mutant. 329 patients (mean age, 55 ± 15 years, 197 men) were eligible. Synthetic K Synthetic PK maps generated from DCE-MRI using a spatiotemporal probabilistic deep-learning model showed improved reliability without compromising diagnostic performance in glioma grading. Question Can a deep learning model enhance the reliability of dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) for more consistent and clinically acceptable glioma imaging? Findings A spatiotemporal deep learning model outperformed the Tofts model in Ktrans reliability and preserved diagnostic performance for IDH mutation and glioma grade, bypassing arterial input function estimation. Clinical relevance Enhancing DCE-MRI reliability with deep learning improves imaging consistency, supports molecular tumor characterization through reproducible pharmacokinetic maps, and enables personalized treatment planning, which might lead to better clinical outcomes for patients with diffuse gliomas.",1699
40251443,Deep learning reconstruction for detection of liver lesions at standard-dose and reduced-dose abdominal CT.,European radiology,2025,"Deep learning reconstruction (DLR) has shown promising image denoising ability, but its radiation dose reduction potential remains unknown. The objective of this study was to investigate the diagnostic performance of DLR compared to iterative reconstruction (IR) in the detection of liver lesions at standard-dose and reduced-dose CT. Participants with known liver metastases from gastrointestinal and pancreatic adenocarcinoma were prospectively included from routine follow-up (October 2020 to March 2022). Participants received standard-dose CT and two additional reduced-dose scans during the same contrast administration, each reconstructed with IR and high-strength DLR. Two radiologists evaluated images for the presence of liver lesions, and a third established a reference standard. Diagnostic performance was compared using McNemar's test and mixed effects logistic regression. Forty-four participants (mean age 66 years ± 11 [standard deviation], 28 men) were evaluated with 348 included liver lesions ≤ 20 mm (297 metastases, 51 benign; mean size 9.1 ± 4.3 mm). Mean volume CT dose index was 14.2, 7.8 mGy, and 5.1 mGy. Between algorithms, no significant difference in lesion detection was observed within dose levels. Detection of 233 lesions ≤ 10 mm was deteriorated with lower dose levels despite DLR denoising, with 185 detected at standard-dose IR (79.4%; 95% CI: 73.5-84.3) vs 128 at medium-dose DLR (54.9%; 95% CI: 48.3-61.4; p < 0.001) and 105 at low-dose DLR (45.1%; 95% CI: 38.6-51.7; p < 0.001). Diagnostic performance for liver lesion detection was comparable between algorithms. When the detection of smaller lesions is important, DLR did not facilitate substantial dose reduction. Question Methods to reduce CT radiation dose are desirable in clinical practice, and DLR has shown promising image denoising capabilities. Findings Liver lesion detection was comparable for DLR and IR across dose levels, but detection of smaller lesions deteriorated with lower dose levels. Clinical relevance Although potent in image noise reduction, the diagnostic performance of DLR is comparable to IR at standard-dose and reduced-dose CT. Care must be taken in pursuit of dose reduction when the detection and characterization of smaller liver lesions are of clinical importance.",2291
40251442,Predicting lymphovascular invasion in stage IA lung adenocarcinoma: a CT-based classification and regression tree model.,European radiology,2025,"Lymphovascular invasion (LVI) is a significant histopathological marker associated with poor prognosis in patients. However, there is a notable lack of reliable, non-invasive preoperative tools to predict LVI accurately. To develop and validate a computed tomography (CT)-based classification and regression tree (CART) model for the preoperative prediction of LVI in patients with clinical stage IA lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). This multicenter cohort study recruited patients who underwent resection and had a preoperative CT examination. An internal cohort (n = 525) is included to construct the LVI classification and regression tree model (LVI-CART). An external cohort (n = 115) and a public cohort (n = 57) are then used to fully validate the predictive performance of the LVI-CART. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and univariable Cox regression analyses were conducted to investigate the relationship between predicted LVI status and survival. The LVI-CART model includes two features, diameter and nodule type, and shows acceptable performance in predicting pathological LVI, with area under the curve values of 0.719, 0.756, and 0.835 in the internal validation set, external validation set and test set, respectively. A predicted LVI positive relative to the median value in the outcomes cohort was found to be independently associated with 1-, 3-year RFS and 1-, 3-, 5-year OS (all p-values < 0.05). The LVI-CART model could be used to preoperatively predict LVI and identify patients with poor prognosis in clinical IA LUAD. The model is like to be simple and easily applicable to risk stratification. Question Lymphovascular invasion is a critical histopathological indicator of poor prognosis, necessitating reliable non-invasive preoperative predictive tools. Findings The classification and regression tree model for predicting lymphovascular invasion (LVI-CART) model demonstrates adequate predictive ability for pathological LVI, portending poor recurrence-free and overall survival. Clinical relevance The LVI-CART model provides clinicians with an easy-to-use method for preoperative identification of patients with clinical stage IA lung adenocarcinoma who are LVI-positive. It also provides a framework for a comprehensive assessment of patient survival risk.",2280
40251440,Volumetric and diffusion MRI longitudinal patterns in brain metastases after laser interstitial thermal therapy.,European radiology,2025,"To characterize MRI changes of brain metastases (BM) following laser interstitial thermal therapy (LITT), particularly in lesions exhibiting durable response or early progression. Longitudinal scans from patients with LITT-treated BM were retrospectively analyzed. Treatment response was categorized as durable response, long-term disease control (i.e., stable at 1 year), stable disease < 1 year, or progression < 1 year. Volumetric and diffusion MRI changes after LITT were analyzed for each subregion (contrast-enhancing, central non-enhancing, whole lesion). Volumetric changes were modeled with bi-exponential fits in responding lesions and progressors. 295 MRI scans from 47 lesions across 42 patients (57.8 ± 14.3 years old, males:females 21:21) were analyzed. Overall, the post-LITT scan showed a lesion enlargement (p < 0.0001 for all subregions), more pronounced in the contrast-enhancing (CE) component (median = +77%, p < 0.0001), and a reduction in the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) (p < 0.001), especially in the central non-CE component (median = -224 × 10 BM typically exhibit an early volume increase with diffusion restriction after LITT. Responders then show bi-exponential shrinkage with gradual diffusion increase. Progression can usually be detected only after 3-4 months, because earlier radiographic patterns may overlap with responding lesions. Question Laser interstitial thermal therapy (LITT) is an emerging local treatment for brain metastases, but the radiographic patterns following this treatment have not been thoroughly described. Findings Responding lesions showed a typical radiographic pattern with early volumetric enlargement and diffusion restriction (not exclusive of responders), followed by a bi-exponential shrinkage and diffusion elevation. Clinical relevance Being aware of the typical radiographic changes in brain metastases responding to LITT is informative for the interpretation of follow-up images. Early volumetric and diffusion changes (< 3-4 months) do not appear to be reliable markers to predict treatment success.",2078
40249223,Mammographic classification of interval breast cancers and artificial intelligence performance.,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,2025,"European studies suggest that artificial intelligence (AI) can reduce interval breast cancers. Research on interval breast cancer classification and AI's effectiveness in the United States, however, particularly using digital breast tomosynthesis and annual screening, is limited. We aimed to mammographically classify interval breast cancers and assess AI performance using a 12-month screening interval. From digital mammography and digital breast tomosynthesis screening mammograms acquired between 2010 and 2019 at a US tertiary-care academic center, we identified interval breast cancers diagnosed less than 12 months after a negative mammogram. At least 3 breast radiologists retrospectively classified interval breast cancers as missed-reading error, minimal signs-actionable, minimal signs-nonactionable, true interval, occult, or missed-technical error. A deep-learning AI tool assigned risk scores ranging from 1 to 10 to the negative index screening mammograms, with scores of 8 or higher considered ""flagged."" Statistical analysis evaluated associations among interval breast cancer types and AI exam scores, AI markings, and patient and tumor characteristics. From 184 935 screening mammograms (65% digital mammography, 35% digital breast tomosynthesis), we identified 148 interval breast cancers in 148 women (mean [SD] age = 61 [12] years). Of these, 26% were minimal signs-actionable, 24% were occult, 22% were minimal signs-nonactionable, 17% were missed-reading error, 6% were true interval, and 5% were missed-technical error (P < .001). AI scored 131 mammograms (17 errors excluded); it most frequently flagged exams with missed-reading error (90%), minimal signs-actionable (89%), and minimal signs-nonactionable (72%) (P = .02). AI localized mammographically visible types more accurately (35%-68%) than nonvisible types (0%-50%; P = .02). AI more frequently flagged and accurately localized interval breast cancer types that were mammographically visible at screening (missed or minimal signs) compared with true interval or occult cancers.",2063
40244408,Multivariable model to predict breast cancer in non-mass enhancement lesions: a study on contrast-enhanced mammography.,European radiology,2025,"To explore morphology and enhancement features of malignant non-mass enhancement (NME) lesions in contrast-enhanced mammography (CEM), and to develop a multivariable model that can accurately predict the probability of malignancy in NME lesions. A total of 162 patients with 206 NME lesions were enrolled. The ratio of 7:3 was randomly divided into a training data set and a test data set. Differences between benign and malignant NME diseases were compared using statistical analysis in the training data set. A logistic regression analysis was used to develop a multivariable model for predicting the probability of malignancy in the training data set. The predictive value of the model was assessed by calculating the area under the curve (AUC) in both training and test data sets. The incidence of malignancy was higher in cases with malignant microcalcification (32.35%), segmental and linear distribution (55.88%), clumped and clustered ring enhancement pattern (70.59%), and Type III curve (64.71%) (all p < 0.002). The sensitivity, specificity, and AUC of the multivariable model in the training data set and the test data set were 79.41-80.77%, 94.44-97.37%, and 0.920-0.946, respectively. When combining microcalcification and enhancement features, the multivariable model for CEM demonstrated acceptable sensitivity and high specificity in predicting malignant NME lesions. Question CEM has gained momentum as an innovative and clinically useful method, but it has not been identified for the discrimination efficacy of NME lesions. Findings The multivariable model of CEM can improve the diagnostic efficiency of breast malignancy NME lesions, with acceptable sensitivity and high specificity. Clinical relevance CEM is an innovative advancement in breast imaging technology. This multivariable model of CEM integrates factors such as microcalcifications, enhancement morphological distribution, internal enhancement patterns, and time-signal intensity curves, thereby enabling accurate diagnosis of NME lesions.",2024
40240554,"Comparison of contrast-enhanced cone-beam breast CT, MRI, and mammography for breast cancer characterization.",European radiology,2025,"To compare the consistency of contrast-enhanced cone-beam breast CT (CE-CBBCT), MRI and mammography regarding characterization of breast cancer. In this retrospective study, patients with breast cancer who underwent preoperative CE-CBBCT, MRI, and mammography between January 2017 and July 2022 were enrolled. Three experienced radiologists independently interpreted the characteristics of breast lesions on each imaging mode referring to BI-RADS, with a 4-week wash-out period. One of the three radiologists reviewed the CE-CBBCT images 4 weeks after the initial evaluation. Cross-modality consistency was calculated by Cohen's Kappa based on majority report. Inter-and intra-reader agreement were assessed using Fleiss and Cohen's Kappa, respectively. The association between imaging factors and consistency levels was analyzed using chi-square and Mann-Whitney U test. A total of 214 malignant lesions identified in 207 patients were enrolled. CE-CBBCT showed almost perfect agreement with MRI on lesion type identification (Kappa = 0.865, 95% CI: 0.802-0.928), but fair agreement with mammography (Kappa = 0.287, 95% CI: 0.205-0.369). CE-CBBCT showed substantial agreement on characterization with MRI for both mass (Kappa = 0.752-0.824) and non-mass enhancement (NME) (Kappa = 0.702-0.729), and non-contrast-enhanced CBBCT (NCE-CBBCT) showed substantial agreement with mammography for calcification (Kappa = 0.717-0.777). Inter- (Kappa = 0.611-0.738) and intra-reader (Kappa = 0.757-0.887) agreement were substantial on CE-CBBCT interpretation. There was no statistically significant difference in imaging factors between different consistency levels (all p > 0.05). CE-CBBCT showed high consistency on mass and NME characterization with MRI, and on calcification with mammography, indicating that CE-CBBCT could combine morphology, hemodynamic and calcification features, and the corresponding descriptors have the feasibility to describe CE-CBBCT characteristics of breast cancer. Question Contrast-enhanced cone-beam breast CT (CE-CBBCT) is widely used in the diagnosis and assessment of breast cancer, but there is no standardized lexicon for image interpretation. Findings CE-CBBCT showed high consistency and comparable reproducibility with MRI and mammography for characterizing breast cancer lesions. Clinical relevance The findings prove that CE-CBBCT could combine morphology, hemodynamic, and calcification features and provide support for the feasibility of applying the BI-RADS descriptors of MRI and mammography to interpret contrast-enhanced cone-beam breast CT images in clinic.",2599
40234338,Pros and cons of reporting incidental findings in lung cancer screening.,European radiology,2025,"Incidental findings (IFs) are common in lung cancer screening (LCS). While the detection of some of these findings can lead to early diagnosis and treatment of clinically significant conditions, it also carries the risks of overdiagnosis and overtreatment, causing anxiety for patients and increased economic costs for health systems. Effective management of IFs requires a balanced approach guided by clear guidelines, standardized reporting, and participants-centered communication. As the field of LCS evolves, continued research and innovation will be essential in refining the strategies for managing IFs, ensuring that the benefits of screening are maximized while minimizing potential harm. Evidence-based guidelines on reporting and management of IFs, however, are still lacking. This narrative review explores the pros and cons of reporting IFs in LCS, focusing on key controversies. KEY POINTS: Reporting and managing incidental findings in lung cancer screening is largely debated. The detection of incidental findings can lead to early diagnosis of clinically significant conditions but carries the risks of overdiagnosis and overtreatment. A balance must be found to have a positive impact on the population while not placing a burden on healthcare systems.",1270

Noninvasive methods to quantify ITH are currently limited. Purpose To quantify ITH in breast cancer using pretreatment MRI, develop a nomogram to predict pathologic complete response (pCR) to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) and recurrence-free survival (RFS), and investigate biologic pathways associated with nomogram scores. Materials and Methods This retrospective study included patients with breast cancer who underwent NAC at nine centers between April 1988 and December 2023. Tumor regions on MRI scans were clustered and integrated with global pixel distribution patterns to calculate ITH scores. A nomogram for predicting pCR was developed using multivariable logistic regression. A survival dataset was used to evaluate the association between nomogram score and RFS, and a genomics dataset was used to explore the relationship between nomogram score and biologic pathways. Results The study included 1448 women (median age, 49 years [IQR, 43-54 years]).

40221941,Longitudinal MRI in comparison to low-dose CT for follow-up of incidental pulmonary nodules in patients with COPD-a nationwide multicenter trial.,European radiology,2025,"This multicenter trial was conducted to evaluate MRI for the longitudinal management of incidental pulmonary nodules in heavy smokers. 239 participants (63.9 ± 8.4 years, 43-82 years) at risk of or with COPD GOLDI-IV from 16 centers prospectively underwent two rounds of same-day low-dose computed tomography (LDCT1&2) and MRI1&2 at an interval of three years in the nationwide COSYCONET trial. All exams were independently assessed for incidental pulmonary nodules in a standardized fashion by two blinded readers, incl. axis measurements and Lung-RADS categorization, with consensual LDCT results serving as the standard of reference. A change in diameter ≥ 2 mm was rated as progress. 11 patients underwent surgery for suspicious nodules after the first round. Two hundred twenty-four of two hundred forty nodules (93.3%) persisted from LDCT1 to LDCT2, with a sensitivity of MRI2 of 82.8% and 81.5% for readers 1 and 2, respectively. Agreement in Lung-RADS categories between LDCT2 and MRI2 was substantial in per-nodule (κ = 0.62-0.70) and excellent in a per-patient (κ = 0.86-0.88) approach for both readers, respectively. Concordance between LDCT2 and MRI2 for growth was excellent to almost perfect (κ = 0.88-1.0). The accuracy of LDCT1 and MRI1 for lung cancer was 87.5%. Lung-RADS ≥ 3 category on MRI1 had higher accuracy for predicting progress (23.1% and 21.4%, respectively) than LDCT1 (15.8%). Compared to LDCT, MRI shows similar capabilities for the longitudinal evaluation of incidental nodules in heavy smokers. Decision-making for nodule management guided by Lung-RADS seems feasible based on longitudinal MRI. Question Can MRI serve as an alternative to low-dose CT (LDCT) for the longitudinal management of pulmonary nodules in heavy smokers, addressing concerns over radiation exposure? Findings MRI demonstrated substantial agreement with LDCT in detecting nodule growth, accurately categorizing Lung-RADS, and comparable accuracy in identifying malignancy over a three-year follow-up. Clinical relevance Longitudinal MRI demonstrates high consistency with LDCT in assessing the growth of incidental pulmonary nodules and categorizing per-patient Lung-RADS, offering a reliable, radiation-free alternative for monitoring and early malignancy detection in high-risk populations.",2298
40221940,Evaluation of high-resolution pituitary dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI using deep learning-based compressed sensing and super-resolution reconstruction.,European radiology,2025,"This study aims to assess diagnostic performance of high-resolution dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI with deep learning-based compressed sensing and super-resolution (DLCS-SR) reconstruction for identifying microadenomas. This prospective study included 126 participants with suspected pituitary microadenomas who underwent DCE MRI between June 2023 and January 2024. Four image groups were derived from single-scan DCE MRI, which included 1.5-mm slice thickness images using DLCS-SR (1.5-mm DLCS-SR images), 1.5-mm slice thickness images with deep learning-based compressed sensing reconstruction (1.5-mm DLCS images), 1.5-mm routine images, and 3-mm slice thickness images using DLCS-SR (3-mm DLCS-SR images). Diagnostic criteria were established by incorporating laboratory findings, clinical symptoms, medical histories, previous imaging, and certain pathologic reports. Two readers assessed the diagnostic performance in identifying pituitary abnormalities and microadenomas. Diagnostic agreements were assessed using κ statistics, and intergroup comparisons for microadenoma detection were performed using the DeLong and McNemar tests. The 1.5-mm DLCS-SR images (κ = 0.746-0.848) exhibited superior diagnostic agreement, outperforming 1.5-mm DLCS (κ = 0.585-0.687), 1.5-mm routine (κ = 0.449-0.487), and 3-mm DLCS-SR images (κ = 0.347-0.369) (p < 0.001 for all). Additionally, the performance of 1.5-mm DLCS-SR images in identifying microadenomas [area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), 0.89-0.94] surpassed that of 1.5-mm DLCS (AUC, 0.83-0.87; p = 0.042 and 0.011, respectively), 1.5-mm routine (AUC, 0.76-0.78; p < 0.001), and 3-mm DLCS-SR images (AUC, 0.72-0.74; p < 0.001). The findings revealed superior diagnostic performance of 1.5-mm DLCS-SR images in identifying pituitary abnormalities and microadenomas, indicating the clinical-potential of high-resolution DCE MRI. Question What strategies can overcome the resolution limitations of conventional dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI, and which contribute to a high false-negative rate in diagnosing pituitary microadenomas? Findings Deep learning-based compressed sensing and super-resolution reconstruction applied to DCE MRI achieved high resolution while improving image quality and diagnostic efficacy. Clinical relevance DCE MRI with a 1.5-mm slice thickness and high in-plane resolution, utilizing deep learning-based compressed sensing and super-resolution reconstruction, significantly enhances diagnostic accuracy for pituitary abnormalities and microadenomas, enabling timely and effective patient management.",2612
40220146,Artificial intelligence in magnetic resonance imaging for predicting lymph node metastasis in rectal cancer patients: a meta-analysis.,European radiology,2025,"This meta-analysis aims to evaluate the diagnostic performance of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based artificial intelligence (AI) in the preoperative detection of lymph node metastasis (LNM) in patients with rectal cancer and to compare it with the diagnostic performance of radiologists. A thorough literature search was conducted across PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science to identify relevant studies published up to September 2024. The selected studies focused on the diagnostic performance of MRI-based AI in detecting rectal cancer LNM. A bivariate random-effects model was employed to calculate pooled sensitivity and specificity, each reported with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Study heterogeneity was assessed using the I Seventeen studies were included in this meta-analysis. The pooled sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve (AUC) for MRI-based AI in detecting preoperative LNM in rectal cancer were 0.71 (95% CI: 0.66-0.74), 0.71 (95% CI: 0.67-0.75), and 0.77 (95% CI: 0.73-0.80), respectively. For radiologists, these values were 0.64 (95% CI: 0.49-0.77), 0.72 (95% CI: 0.62-0.80), and 0.74 (95% CI: 0.68-0.80). Both analyses showed no significant publication bias (p > 0.05). MRI-based AI demonstrates diagnostic performance similar to that of radiologists. The high heterogeneity among studies limits the strength of these findings, and further research with external validation datasets is necessary to confirm the results and assess their practical clinical value. Question How effective is MRI-based AI in detecting LNM in rectal cancer patients compared to traditional radiology methods? Findings The diagnostic performance of MRI-based AI is comparable to radiologists, with pooled sensitivity and specificity both at 0.71, indicating moderate accuracy. Clinical relevance Integrating MRI-based AI can enhance diagnostic efficiency in identifying LNM, especially in settings with limited access to skilled radiologists, but requires further validation.",1990
40214737,Influence of imaging method on fat fraction estimation for assessing bone marrow in metastatic prostate cancer.,European radiology,2025,"This study aimed to assess the accuracy of fat fraction estimation with clinically available Dixon sequences in normal-appearing marrow and bone metastases in the pelvis of metastatic prostate cancer patients. A prospective single-centre study was conducted with metastatic prostate cancer patients and healthy volunteers. Linearity and bias of fat fraction estimates from clinically available Dixon sequences were assessed against a 6-point PDw gradient echo (q-Dixon) sequence measuring the reference standard proton density fat fraction. Lesion fat fraction estimates were cross-compared using the Friedman test. Repeatability in volunteers was evaluated with Bland-Altman plots. Sensitivity of fat fraction estimates using TSE-Dixon sequences to specific absorption rate (SAR) related modifications were evaluated with correlation plots. Thirty-three patients were recruited for this study. Significant (p < 0.05) absolute bias (12.4%) was demonstrated in the T1-weighted (T1w) Dixon measurements against the q-Dixon. Significant differences (p < 0.05) between fat fraction estimates provided by the T1w Dixon and PDw Dixon sequences were observed in 13 active and 6 treated lesions. Repeatability coefficients for fat fraction estimates ranged from 5.9 to 9.0% in the pelvic tissues of healthy volunteers. Reduction of slice number with repetition time for SAR had the greatest effect, reaching a maximum difference in fat fraction of 14.7% from the q-Dixon for the T2w-TSE Dixon in bone marrow. T1w Dixon methods can detect post-treatment changes but remain confounded by relaxation time biases. While all Dixon methods showed good repeatability, careful choice of SAR-related modifications is critical to maintaining accuracy for PD- and T2-weighted TSE sequences. Question The clinical validity of signal-weighted fat fraction estimates versus proton density fat fraction for characterising metastatic bone lesions has not been fully assessed. Findings T1-weighted Dixon sequences in line with whole-body MRI international guidelines demonstrate significant fat fraction bias, particularly in lesions and muscle. Clinical relevance Fat fraction estimation using T1-weighted Dixon sequences recommended in international guidelines are highly sensitive to relaxation time biases, making underlying physiological changes potentially ambiguous.",2348
40214735,Predicting postresection outcomes in solitary small hepatocellular carcinoma via pretreatment MR imaging features: subgroup analysis according to alpha-fetoprotein expression.,European radiology,2025,"To develop models including MRI features for predicting recurrence-free survival (RFS) in patients with solitary small hepatocellular carcinoma (SHCC) following curative resection according to alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) expression and for achieving risk stratification. A total of 201 solitary SHCC patients diagnosed pathologically who underwent MRI were enrolled retrospectively and divided into AFP-negative (n = 85) and AFP-positive (n = 116) SHCC groups. Clinicopathological factors, imaging features, and geometric parameters associated with RFS were determined by univariate and multivariate Cox analyses. Two prognostic models predicting postresection RFS were developed by multivariate Cox proportional hazard model, and their discriminatory ability was evaluated by the concordance index (C-index) and conducted internal validation. Kaplan‒Meier analysis with RFS as the endpoint was used to assess model performance. The predictors of RFS in AFP-negative SHCC included mosaic architecture, portal-venous phase tumor-to-right erector spinae muscle signal intensity ratio, and sphericity, whereas those in AFP-positive SHCC were liver cirrhosis, tumor growth subtype, and asphericity. The C-indexes of the models in predicting RFS in AFP-negative and AFP-positive SHCC were 0.700 and 0.717, respectively. The risk probability calculated with the models stratified the two patient subgroups into two risk groups with significantly different survival outcomes (p < 0.001). Our two prognostic models may assist physicians in stratifying risk and monitoring relapses in patients with AFP-negative or AFP-positive solitary SHCCs. Question This study explored the predictors of the postresection outcomes of patients with small hepatocellular carcinoma according to the level of alpha-fetoprotein expression. Findings Pretreatment MRI and geometric features can serve as prognostic markers for predicting postoperative recurrence-free survival of small hepatocellular carcinoma with different alpha-fetoprotein expression. Clinical relevance Our models guide clinicians in administering appropriate therapeutic decisions and implementing proper postoperative monitoring regimens in different alpha-fetoprotein expression small hepatocellular carcinoma patients.",2261
40214734,Short-term intra- and peri-tumoral spatiotemporal CT radiomics for predicting major pathological response to neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy in non-small cell lung cancer.,European radiology,2025,"This study aims to develop a short-term spatiotemporal CT radiomics model to predict the major pathological response (MPR) to neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy (NCI) in NSCLC by decoding the intra- and peri-tumoral imaging phenotypes. A total of 352 patients undergoing curative surgery following NCI for NSCLC were enrolled from two centers, forming a training cohort (n = 186), an internal validation cohort (n = 80), and an external validation cohort (n = 86). Intra- and peri-tumoral CT radiomics features were computed to capture imaging phenotypes of the tumor microenvironment. Delta radiomics features were also calculated by quantifying changes in each radiomics feature. A support vector machine classifier was utilized to develop the short-term spatiotemporal model by analyzing changes in radiomics features. The multi-timepoint short-term spatiotemporal model, incorporating pre-treatment, post-treatment and delta radiomic features, achieved AUC values of 0.84, 0.77, and 0.75 in the training, internal validation, and external validation cohorts, respectively. These results significantly outperformed the RECIST model and pre-treatment model, with p-values < 0.05 indicating statistical significance. This study demonstrates that short-term temporal analysis of intra- and peri-tumoral CT radiomics is a promising approach for predicting MPR to NCI in NSCLC. These findings underscore the potential of radiomics as a non-invasive tool for assessing treatment response and guiding personalized therapy in NSCLC patients. Question Neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy has improved in major pathological response rate for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), but it is unclear which patients will benefit most. Findings The multi-timepoint short-term spatiotemporal model based on CT pictures demonstrates high predictive performance for assessing major pathological response following neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy in NSCLC.

40209572,"Global disparities in artificial intelligence-based mammogram interpretation for breast cancer: A scientometric analysis of representation, trends, and equity.","European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",2025,"Breast cancer (BC) is the most frequently diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of cancer death among women worldwide. Artificial intelligence (AI) shows promise for improving mammogram interpretation, especially in resource-limited settings. However, concerns remain regarding the diversity of datasets and the representation of researchers in AI model development, which may affect the models' generalizability, fairness, and equity. We performed a scientometric analysis of studies published in 2017, 2018, 2022, and 2023 that used screening or diagnostic mammograms for BC detection to train or validate AI algorithms. PubMed (MEDLINE) and EMBASE were searched in July 2024. Data extraction focused on patient cohort sociodemographics (including age and race/ethnicity), geographic distribution (categorized by World Bank country income levels and regions), and author profiles (sex, affiliation, and funding sources). Of 5774 studies identified, 264 met the inclusion criteria. The number of studies increased from 28 in 2017 to 115 in 2023-a 311 % increase. Despite this growth, only 0-25 % of studies reported race/ethnicity, with most patients identified as Caucasian. Moreover, nearly all patient cohorts originated from high-income countries, with no studies from low-income settings. Author affiliations were predominantly from high-income regions, and gender imbalance was observed among first and last authors. The lack of racial, ethnic, and geographic diversity in both datasets and researcher representation could undermine the generalizability and fairness of AI-based mammogram interpretation. Addressing these disparities through diverse dataset collection and inclusive international collaborations is critical to ensuring equitable improvements in breast cancer care.",1789

Purpose To compare the performance of standalone AI for second breast cancer surveillance on unilateral mammograms with that of radiologists reading mammograms without AI assistance. Materials and Methods In this retrospective institutional database study, patients who were diagnosed with breast cancer between January 2001 and December 2018 and underwent postmastectomy surveillance mammography from January 2011 to March 2023 were included. Radiologists' mammogram interpretations without AI assistance were collected from these records and compared with AI interpretations of the same mammograms. The reference standards were histologic examination and 1-year follow-up data. The cancer detection rate per 1000 screening examinations, sensitivity, and specificity of standalone AI and the radiologists' interpretations without AI were compared using the McNemar test. Results Among the 4184 asymptomatic female patients (mean age, 52 years), 111 (2.7%) had contralateral second breast cancer.

Purpose To determine whether CT-detected lymph node distribution patterns can improve lymph node evaluation in MSI-H colon cancer. Materials and Methods This two-center retrospective study included patients with MSI-H colon cancer who underwent pretreatment CT and radical surgery (development set, December 2017-December 2022; test set, January 2016-January 2024). Lymph node characteristics associated with pathologic lymph node metastasis (pN+), including clinical lymph node stage (cN) and distribution patterns (vascular distribution, jammed cluster, and partial fusion), were selected (logistic regression and Kendall tau-b correlation) to create a distribution-based clinical lymph node stage (dcN) in the development set. Diagnostic performance was verified in the test set. Interobserver agreement was assessed by using Fleiss κ. Clinical value of dcN was assessed using univariable logistic analysis among patients in the treatment set receiving neoadjuvant immunotherapy (August 2017-February 2024). Results The study included 368 patients (median age, 60 years [IQR, 50-70 years]; 211 male): 230 from the development set (median age, 59 years [IQR, 49-70 years]), 86 from the test set (median age, 66 years [IQR, 55-79 years]), and 52 from the treatment set (median age, 54 years [IQR, 42-65 years]).

40192805,Diffusion levels for quantitative assessment of the apparent diffusion coefficient value in prostate MRI: a proof-of-concept bicentric study.,European radiology,2025,"To investigate the performance of Diffusion levels (DLs) in diagnosing clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa) when combined with the PI-RADS version 2.1. This retrospective, bicentric study included 261 men who underwent 3.0-T prostate MRI between March 2020 and April 2023, receiving systematic and target prostate biopsy on PI-RADS ≥ 3 lesions. Two readers measured the Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) of PI-RADS 1-5 findings in the peripheral zone. By plotting the cumulative frequency of csPCa versus ADCs and using ROC analysis, we derived four DLs expressing levels of restricted diffusion, i.e., very low DL (VL-DL), low DL (L-DL), intermediate DL (I-DL), and high DL (H-DL). We compared the per-lesion diagnostic performance in assessing csPCa (grading group ≥ 2 cancer) assuming to biopsy PI-RADS ≥ 3 lesions (strategy 1), PI-RADS ≥ 3 lesions adjusted with ADC values (strategy 2-4), and PI-RADS ≥ 3 lesions adjusted with DLs (strategy 5-7). Net benefit was assessed with decision curve analysis. csPCa was found in 79/261 men (30.3%) and 152/528 lesions (28.8%). There was a negative correlation (p < 0.0001) between ADC versus malignancy rate (tau -0.970) and DLs versus csPCa grading group (tau -0.614). csPCa prevalence was highest in VL-DL (72.2%) and L-DL (54.4%). Most DLs-based strategies increased specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and net benefit compared to ADC-based strategies or PI-RADS alone. The best strategy showed 94.7% sensitivity, 82.9% specificity, 69.2% PPV, and 97.5% negative predictive value. While larger-scale validation is needed, DLs have the potential to improve PI-RADS-based biopsy decisions for detecting csPCa in the peripheral zone. Question It is still unclear how to incorporate quantitative information from diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) into prostate MRI. Findings Combining DWI-derived diffusion levels (DLs) with the PI-RADS version 2.1 categorization reduced false positives while preserving high sensitivity for clinically significant prostate cancer. Clinical relevance DLs permit to easily account for ADC values of prostate lesions and, in turn, refine biopsy decisions.",2154
40192540,Validation and Derivation of miRNA-Based Germline Signatures Predicting Radiation Toxicity in Prostate Cancer.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,2025,"Although radiotherapy (RT) is one of the primary treatment modalities used in the treatment of cancer, patients often experience toxicity during or after treatment. RT-induced genitourinary (GU) toxicity is a significant survivorship challenge for patients with prostate cancer, but identifying those at risk has been challenging. Herein, we attempt (i) to validate a previously identified biomarker of late RT-induced GU toxicity, PROSTOX, consisting primarily of miRNA-based germline biomarkers (mirSNPs), and (ii) investigate the possibility of temporally and genetically defining other forms of RT-associated GU toxicity. We included 148 patients enrolled in Magnetic Resonance Imaging-Guided Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy for Prostate Cancer (MIRAGE; NCT04384770), a trial comparing MRI- versus CT-guided prostate stereotactic body RT. Linear regression was used to evaluate the association between PROSTOX score and late GU grade toxicity. Machine learning approaches were used to develop predictive models for acute toxicity and chronic GU toxicity, and the accuracy of all models was assessed using AUC metrics. A comparative Gene Ontology analysis was performed. PROSTOX accurately predicts late GU toxicity, achieving an AUC of 0.76, and demonstrates strong correlation with GU toxicity grade (p-1.2E-9). mirSNP-based signatures can distinguish acute RT-associated GU toxicity and chronic RT-associated GU toxicity (AUCs of 0.770 and 0.763, respectively). Finally, Gene Ontology analysis identifies unique pathways involved in each form of GU toxicity: acute, chronic, and late. These findings provide strong evidence for the continued application of mirSNPs to predict toxicity to RT and act as a path for the continued personalization of RT with improved patient outcomes.",1785
40186632,Super-resolution ultrasound imaging of intranodal lymphatic sinuses for predicting sentinel lymph node metastasis in breast cancer: a preliminary study.,European radiology,2025,"Accurate preoperative localization and characterization of sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) is vital in breast cancer management. The application of super-resolution ultrasound (SRUS) imaging to visualize intranodal lymphatic sinuses for the prediction of SLN metastasis has yet to be investigated. The study aimed to assess the value of SRUS imaging of intranodal lymphatic sinuses in predicting SLN metastasis in breast cancer patients. A total of 154 SLNs from 143 patients with breast cancer were prospectively included. All patients underwent conventional US of axillary lymph nodes and SRUS imaging of lymph sinus by percutaneous microbubble injection. Qualitative and quantitative analysis were performed for SRUS imaging, with qualitative analysis focusing on identifying perfusion defects and quantitative analysis including parameters such as lymphatic sinus density, sinus diameter, sinus distance, and lymph flow velocity. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity were calculated for conventional US, SRUS, and combined conventional US and SRUS. Among the 154 SLNs, 73 were metastatic and 81 were reactive. In predicting metastatic SLNs, the AUC for SRUS (0.824; 95% CI: 0.761-0.888) was significantly higher than that for conventional US (0.661; 95% CI: 0.596-0.726) (p < 0.001). The combination of SRUS and conventional US achieved the highest AUC (0.844; 95% CI: 0.785-0.904), which was significantly higher than conventional US alone (p < 0.001), but not significantly different from SRUS alone (p = 0.2). Imaging lymphatic sinuses by SRUS has the potential to predict metastatic SLNs in patients with breast cancer. Question Super-resolution ultrasound (SRUS) used for visualizing intranodal lymphatic sinuses for the prediction of sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) metastasis has yet to be investigated. Findings Microlymphatic circulation of SLNs were imaged by SRUS at ten microns scale. SRUS showed better performance for predicting metastatic SLNs than conventional ultrasound. Clinical relevance SRUS is a reliable tool to image lymphatic sinuses and characterize metastatic SLNs in patients with breast cancer. It helps diagnosis of lymph node status and clinical decision-making of breast cancer.",2265
40185926,MRI-detected extranodal extension as a marker of prostate cancer aggressiveness.,European radiology,2025,"Extranodal extension (ENE) is a histological marker of aggressiveness for various cancers. We evaluated if clinical ENE, detected by Magnetic Resonance Imaging, can also serve as a biological marker of Prostate Cancer (PCa) aggressiveness. This retrospective, single-center study analyzed patients diagnosed with PCa and had MRI on a 3-T scanner from January 2013 to December 2017. After exclusions, 461 patients were included and divided into: Group 1, no lymph node involvement (LNI), Group 2 (LNI without ENE), and Group 3 (LNI and ENE). Two experienced radiologists assessed the MRI scans for primary lesion characteristics, LNI and ENE. Reproducibility assessment was calculated for ENE and PI-RADS. Clinical outcomes, including Overall Survival (OS), Specific Survival Rate (SSR), and Progression-Free Survival (PFS), were analyzed. Group 1 included 410 patients, Group 2, 32 patients, and Group 3, 19 patients. The prevalence of ENE was 4.1%. Significant differences between groups were observed for age, PSA, dPSA, ISUP scores, clinical risk stratification, and staging (all p < 0.01). The Kappa coefficient for ENE was 0.75 (95% CI: 0.56-0.90), and 0.48 (0.14-1.0) for PI-RADS. Cox proportional hazards model showed PSA (HR: 1.009; 95% CI = 1.003-1.015, p < 0.01) and ENE (HR: 8.50; 1.76-40.98, p < 0.01) were associated with SSR, and both ENE (HR: 8.18; 2.34-28.58, p < 0.01) and LNI (HR: 5.99, 1.97-18.17, p < 0.01) were linked to poor PFS. MRI-detected ENE, despite low prevalence, is a predictor of SSR and PFS in PCa. These findings support ENE as an independent prognostic marker. Further prospective, multi-institutional studies are required to validate these results. Question Pathological extranodal extension (pENE) has been described as a marker of worrisome prognosis in prostate cancer (PCa), but clinical ENE has not been evaluated as a marker of prognosis in PCa. Findings MRI-detected clinical ENE, had a low prevalence in our cohort (4.1%), but it was a predictor of specific survival rate and progression-free survival. Clinical relevance MRI-detected clinical ENE, a reproducible imaging feature, may serve as a non-invasive biomarker for aggressive prostate cancer. It correlates with poorer progression-free survival and specific survival rates, offering valuable prognostic insights for patient management.",2337
40185923,ESR Essentials: assessing the radiological response of liver metastases to systemic therapy-practice recommendations by the European Society of Gastrointestinal and Abdominal Radiology.,European radiology,2025,"The liver is a common site for metastatic spread, especially in advanced colorectal, breast, and pancreatic cancers. Imaging evaluation of liver metastases after systemic treatments like chemotherapy, targeted therapy, or immunotherapy is essential to distinguish treatment response from disease progression. The widely used response evaluation criteria in solid tumours (RECIST 1.1) focus on lesion size changes to evaluate treatment response. However, newer therapies, mainly targeted therapy and immunotherapy, often induce changes beyond size reduction, such as tumour necrosis, fibrosis, cystic transformation, calcifications, and modifications at the liver-tumour interface. These morphological and enhancement changes can be evaluated on CT and MRI and may better reflect the biological response in specific clinical settings. Overall, RECIST 1.1 criteria are recommended for assessing the radiological response of liver metastases after systemic treatment. The use of alternative radiological criteria validated on CT (such as Chun or Choi criteria) is recommended in specific clinical settings (e.g. metastatic colorectal cancer or metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumours). Additionally, CT and MR modifications that reflect fibrosis, necrosis, calcifications, and haemorrhage can serve as ancillary indicators of tumoural response. These alternative criteria and radiological findings should be systematically assessed, particularly in liver metastases with minimal size changes, to better identify responders. KEY POINTS: RECIST 1.1 is the standard for evaluating tumour response in solid tumours and is recommended for the assessment of liver metastases after systemic therapy. CT attenuation, enhancement, and liver/tumour interface may correlate better with tumoural response compared to size reduction. CT and MR changes suggesting necrosis, fibrosis, calcifications, and haemorrhage can be used as additional indicators of tumoural response.",1961
40185922,Personalized risk-adapted models in prostate cancer during active surveillance using MRI-a narrative review.,European radiology,2025,"The presence of histologically defined prostate cancer (PCa) is common and rises with age. Nevertheless, histological evidence of PCa does not always lead to clinically evident or life-threatening disease, and we know that PSA-based population screening can find twice the prevalence of PCa than would present via clinical routes. The PROTECT study randomized men diagnosed through PSA screening, to surgery, radiotherapy, or active monitoring. At 15 years, PCa-related deaths ranged from 2.1% in the surgery group to 2.9% in the active monitoring group, while the risk of death from other causes was 22%. Modern PCa diagnosis uses MRI to determine who needs a biopsy and how it is done. Multiparametric MRI can selectively detect PCa of higher grade and volume, which is more likely to be associated with progression, metastases, and death, and hence to benefit from treatment. MRI and MRI-targeted biopsies are recommended prior to enrolment in active surveillance (AS) programs for accurate risk classification. The UCLH AS cohort based on per-cause MRI evaluations has shown baseline Gleason grade and MRI index lesion visibility to be strong predictors of progression to treatment. Serial evaluation with MRI has been codified with the PRECISE recommendations to support MRI-based monitoring during AS. AS recommendations have extended to certain favorable-intermediate risk cancers. The Movember International Consensus Meeting has determined a dynamic risk-stratified AS approach to be the highest-ranked research priority. We review the impact of MRI on AS from patient selection to risk stratification, and the development of MRI-led personalized AS protocols. KEY POINTS: Question Standardized protocols are not able to address the heterogeneity of men on active surveillance for PCa and are burdened by unnecessary examinations. Findings MRI can improve the selection of men for active surveillance, predict time to treatment, and risk-stratify patients at risk of progression. Clinical relevance MRI-led risk-adapted protocols may reduce the burden of active surveillance on patients, improve adherence, and reduce healthcare costs.",2144

A secondary objective was to compare lesion enhancement patterns between CEM and contrast-enhanced (CE)-MRI. The cohort included screening and symptomatic cases from CEM research studies (December 2016-March 2023) with an identifiable lesion. Three breast radiologists independently assessed lesion conspicuity as low, moderate, or high, based on the BI-RADS CEM lexicon. Lesion enhancement was quantified by drawing two regions of interest representing lesion and background parenchyma, to calculate contrast enhancement from the early (CE From 503 CEM studies, 143 BI-RADS 2-5 lesions were analyzed.

In a phase 2 trial (NCT02570308) for advanced uveal melanoma (mUM), 35 % of PD patients experienced ≥ 0.5 log ctDNA reduction, resulting in a median overall survival (OS) of ∼17 months, compared to ∼8 months in the non-ctDNA reduction group. A total of 34 of 127 2L+ mUM patients with PD were split into two groups based on absence or presence of ctDNA reduction (≥0.5 log reduction). Lesions from CT and MRI scans were analyzed using radiomics features at baseline and week eight, yielding two machine-learning-derived patient signatures (16 features). Performance of per-patient analysis (n = 32) and per-lesion analysis (n = 148) was assessed using ROC AUC (95 % confidence interval [CI]). In the per-patient analysis, a volumetric signature classified patients into groups with ROC AUC of 0.71 [0.53-0.90] with 63 % specificity and 81 % sensitivity at the optimal threshold (0.57). In the per-lesion analysis, a radiomic signature reached an ROC AUC of 0.70 [0.58-0.81] with 66 % specificity and 74 % sensitivity at the optimal threshold (0.53). Group B had lower baseline tumor lesion volume (ROC AUC=0.65), distinct baseline (ROC AUC=0.66), and change by week eight (ROC AUC=0.66/0.69 on CT/MRI) in tumor heterogeneity. Radiomic analysis accurately predicted ctDNA reduction in PD patients at both the patient and lesion level. The most influential predictor was decreased tumor heterogeneity observed on CT/MRI.",1651

Automatic assignment of O-RADS scores from reports could increase adoption and accuracy. Purpose To evaluate the accuracy of large language models (LLMs), after strategic optimization, for automatically calculating O-RADS scores from reports. Materials and Methods This retrospective single-center study from a large quaternary care cancer center included consecutive gadolinium chelate-enhanced pelvic MRI reports with at least one assigned O-RADS score from July 2021 to October 2023. Reports from January 2018 to October 2019 (before O-RADS MRI implementation) were randomly selected for additional testing. Reference standard O-RADS scores were determined by radiologists interpreting reports. After prompt optimization using a subset of reports, two LLM-based strategies were evaluated: few-shot learning with GPT-4 (version 0613; OpenAI) prompted with O-RADS rules (""LLM only"") and a hybrid strategy leveraging GPT-4 to classify features fed into a deterministic formula (""hybrid""). Accuracy of each model and originally reported scores were calculated and compared using the McNemar test.

Oncology,2025,"Low-dose CT screening reduces lung cancer mortality. In advance of planned national lung cancer screening programmes, research is needed to inform policies regarding implementation. We aimed to assess the implementation of low-dose CT for lung cancer screening in a high-risk population and to validate a multicancer early detection blood test. In this prospective, longitudinal cohort study, individuals aged 55-77 years recorded as current smokers in their primary care records at any point within the past 20 years were identified from 329 primary care practices in London (UK) and invited for a lung health check via postal letter. Individuals meeting the 2013 United States Preventive Services Taskforce criteria (current or former smokers within the past 15 years with at least 30 pack-year smoking histories) or having a Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian 2012 model 6-year risk of 1·3% or greater, and not currently receiving treatment for an active cancer (except adjuvant hormonal therapy), were eligible for the study. These individuals underwent lung cancer screening via non-contrast, thin collimation low-dose CT. In this analysis, we report the results of the baseline round of low-dose CT screening. Key primary endpoints were those associated with examining the performance of a lung cancer screening service. Outcome measures were analysed on a per-participant level using descriptive frequencies. The study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03934866. Between April 8, 2019, and May 14, 2021, 12 773 participants were recruited and analysed. 7353 (57·6%) of 12 773 participants were male and 5420 (42·4%) were female, and 10 665 (83·5%) participants were White. 261 (2·0%) of 12 773 participants were diagnosed with lung cancer (including 163 [1·3%] participants with screen-detected lung cancer and 98 [0·8%] with delayed screen-detected lung cancer [ie, after a 3-month or 6-month nodule follow-up CT]) and 276 (2·2%) participants were diagnosed with any intrathoracic malignancy after a positive baseline screen. 207 (79·3%) of 261 individuals with prevalent screen-detected lung cancer were diagnosed at stage I or II and surgical resection was the primary treatment modality in 201 (77·0%) of 261 individuals. Including cases where multiple resections were done in the same participant (eg, for synchronous primaries), 28 (11·6%) of 241 surgical resections were benign, and there was one (0·4%) death within 90 days of surgery.

40146116,Incidence and Risk Factors of Interval and Screen-Detected Breast Cancer.,JAMA oncology,2025,"Mammographic screening is the only proven method for early detection and mortality reduction of breast cancer (BC). However, many patients are missed at prior screening; thus, they receive their diagnosis between the interval of screening rounds, called interval cancer (IntCa). Some IntCas are fast growing between screening rounds. To investigate the incidence and proportion of IntCa and screen-detected breast cancer (ScrCa) and identify factors associated with IntCa. This population-based cohort study was conducted from January 1989 to March 2020, with follow-up until 2020 and a mean (SD) follow-up of 13 (8.3) years. The statistical analysis was performed from February 2023 to June 2024. It included cancer-free women (N = 527 144) residing in Stockholm, Sweden, who were invited to undergo mammography screening (aged 40-74 years) during 1989 to 2020. An additional cohort of women were included who were participating in the Karolinska Mammography Project for Risk Prediction of Breast Cancer study and had mammography data available. Family cancer history (defined from the Swedish Multi-Generation Register and Cancer Register), mammographic density, and various demographic, reproductive, and other factors (multiple Swedish registers). Incidence of ScrCa and IntCa (defined from the Swedish Cancer Register in conjunction with individual screening histories). A total of 29 049 women (5.5%) received a diagnosis of BC, of whom 10 631 (2.0%) had ScrCa and 4369 (0.8%) IntCa. ScrCa and IntCa incidences increased during the period. The proportion of IntCa among screened patients with BC was around 30%, which decreased with older age. Factors associated with increased risk of IntCa included older age at first childbirth, higher education level, hormone replacement therapy, and higher mammographic density. Risk estimates of family cancer history on IntCa were family history of BC (hazard ratio [HR], 1.85; 95% CI, 1.72-1.99), family history of IntCa (HR, 2.92; 95% CI, 2.39-3.55), and hereditary breast and ovarian cancers (HR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.36-1.54), with risk further elevated with the number of relatives who received a diagnosis when younger than the median age. Women with IntCa were more likely to have estrogen receptor (ER)-negative cancers than women with ScrCa (22% vs 11%), and having family history of ER-negative BC was associated with 3-fold risk for ER-negative IntCa. The results of this cohort study suggest that IntCa rates have not decreased with age-based screening, and implementing risk-based screening considering IntCa-specific risk factors is necessary for improving outcomes.",2622
40140078,"Retrospective evaluation of a CE-marked AI system, including 1,017,208 mammography screening examinations.",European radiology,2025,"To retrospectively evaluate the performance of a CE-marked AI system for identifying breast cancer on screening mammograms. Evidence from large retrospective studies is crucial for planning prospective studies and to further ensure safe implementation. We used data from screening examinations performed from 2004 to 2021 at ten breast centers in BreastScreen Norway. In the standard independent double reading setting, each radiologist scored each breast from 1 (negative) to 5 (high probability of cancer). The AI system assigned each examination an NT and an SN score; the NT score aimed to classify examinations as negative with minimal misclassification while the SN score aimed to classify examinations as positive with high confidence. N70 was defined as being among the 70% with the lowest NT score and P3 was defined as being among the 3% with the highest SN score. A total of 1,017,208 screening examinations were included in the study sample. At N70, 1.8% (107/5977) of the screen-detected and 34.5% (625/1812) of the interval cancers were defined as negative. Using P3 to define cases as positive, 81.5% (4871/5977) of the screen-detected and 19.0% (344/1812) of the interval cancers were defined as positive. Among the screen-detected cancers in N70, 11.2% (12/107) had an interpretation score > 2 by both radiologists. The AI system performed well according to identifying negative cases and cancer cases. Thus, the AI system can be used to reduce workload for the radiologists and potentially increase the sensitivity of mammography. Question Results from large mammography screening samples not used in training AI algorithms are important to consider when planning prospective studies and implementation. Findings More than 80% of the screening-detected cancers were classified as positive by AI when considering 3% of the examinations with the highest AI risk score as positive. Clinical relevance A lack of radiologists is a challenge in mammographic screening. Our findings support other studies that suggest the use of AI to reduce screen-reading workload.",2077
40139210,"Local anaesthetic transperineal biopsy versus transrectal prostate biopsy in prostate cancer detection (TRANSLATE): a multicentre, randomised, controlled trial.",The Lancet. Oncology,2025,"Prostate cancer diagnosis requires biopsy, traditionally performed under local anaesthetic with ultrasound guidance via a transrectal approach (TRUS). Local anaesthetic ultrasound-guided transperineal biopsy (LATP) is gaining popularity in this setting; however, there is uncertainty regarding prostate sampling, infection rates, tolerability, side-effects, and cost-effectiveness. TRANSLATE was a randomised clinical trial that aimed to compare detection of Gleason Grade Group (GGG) 2 or higher prostate cancer, side-effects, tolerability, and patient-reported outcomes, after LATP versus TRUS biopsy. In this randomised clinical trial which was done at ten hospitals in the UK, patients aged 18 years or older were eligible if investigated for suspected prostate cancer based on elevated age-specific prostate-specific antigen or abnormal digital rectal examination, and if biopsy-naive having received pre-biopsy MRI on a 1·5 or higher Tesla scanner. Individuals were excluded if they had any previous prostate biopsy, extensive local disease easily detectable by any biopsy (prostate-specific antigen >50 ng/mL or entire gland replaced by tumour on MRI), symptoms of concurrent or recent urinary tract infection, history of immunocompromise, need for enhanced antibiotic prophylaxis, absent rectum, or inability to position in lithotomy. Participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive LATP or TRUS biopsy, using web-based software with a randomisation sequence using a minimisation algorithm to ensure balanced allocation across biopsy groups for minimisation factors (recruitment site, and location of the MRI lesion). The primary outcome was detection of GGG 2 or higher prostate cancer, analysed in the modified intention-to-treat population (all randomly assigned to treatment who had a biopsy result available). Key secondary endpoints assessing post-biopsy adverse events were infection, bleeding, urinary and sexual function, tolerability, and patient-reported outcomes. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT05179694) and at ISRCTN (ISRCTN98159689), and is complete. Between Dec 3, 2021, and Sept 26, 2023, 2078 (76%) of 2727 assessed individuals were eligible, and 1126 (41%) of 2727 agreed to participate. 1044 (93%) of the 1126 participants were White British. Participants were allocated to TRUS (n=564) or LATP (n=562) biopsy, and were followed up at time of biopsy, and at 7 days, 35 days, and 4 months post-biopsy. We found GGG 2 or higher prostate cancer in 329 (60%) of 547 participants with biopsy results randomly assigned to LATP compared with 294 (54%) of 540 participants with biopsy results randomly assigned to TRUS biopsy (odds ratio [OR] 1·32 [95% CI 1·03-1·70]; p=0·031). Infection requiring admission to hospital within 35 days post-biopsy occurred in 2 (<1%) of 562 participants in the LATP group compared with 9 (2%) of 564 in the TRUS group. No statistically significant difference was observed in the reporting of overall biopsy-related complications (LATP 454 [81%] of 562 vs TRUS 436 [77%] of 564, OR 1·23 [95% CI 0·93 to 1·65]), urinary retention requiring catheterisation (LATP 35 [6%] of 562 vs TRUS 27 [5%] of 564), urinary symptoms (median International Prostate Symptom Score: LATP 8 [IQR 4-14] vs TRUS 8 [4-13], OR 0·36 [95% CI -0·38 to 1·10]), nor sexual function (median International Index of Erectile Function score: LATP 5 [2-25] vs TRUS 8 [3-24], OR -0·60 [-1·79 to 0·58]) at 4 months after biopsy. Trial participants more commonly reported LATP biopsy to be immediately painful and embarrassing compared with TRUS (LATP 216 [38%] of 562 vs TRUS 153 [27%] of 564; OR 1·84 [95% CI 1·40 to 2·43]). Serious adverse events occurred in 14 (2%) of 562 participants in the LATP group and 25 (4%) of 564 in the TRUS group. Among biopsy-naive individuals being investigated for possible prostate cancer, biopsy with LATP led to greater detection of GGG 2 or higher disease compared with TRUS. These findings will help to inform patients, clinicians, clinical guidelines, and policy makers regarding the important trade-offs between LATP and TRUS prostate biopsy.

40133439,A novel pN stage prediction model for resectable rectal adenocarcinoma based on preoperative MRI features and multiregional apparent diffusion coefficients.,European radiology,2025,"To develop and validate a novel model based on preoperative MRI features and multiregional apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs) to improve the prediction of pN stage in resectable rectal adenocarcinoma (RA). Two hundred fifty-four consecutive patients (median age [interquartile range], 67 [56-74] years; 156 males) with resectable RA were retrospectively collected at two medical centers from January 2017 to December 2023 and were divided into the training (n = 139), internal validation (n = 60), and external validation (n = 55) sets. All patients underwent preoperative MRI scans. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted on the MRI features and multiregional (RA, peritumoral tissue, and tumor-adjacent rectal wall) ADCs to construct a nomogram model for preoperative predicting pN stage in the training set. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to evaluate the predictive performance of the nomogram model vs the conventional MRI-assessed N (mriN) stage. The ROC curves were compared using the DeLong test. The predictors incorporated in the nomogram model comprised gross tumor volume, categories of short diameter of maximum node, extramural vascular invasion, mesorectal fascia involvement, and ADCs of RA and peritumoral tissue. This model yielded a better prediction of the pN stage compared to the mriN stage in training (AUC, 0.848 vs 0.672; p < 0.001), internal validation (AUC, 0.843 vs 0.699; p = 0.008), and external validation (AUC, 0.857 vs 0.723; p = 0.01) sets. This novel model based on the preoperative MRI features and multiregional ADCs can improve the prediction of the pN stage in RA. Question Accurate preoperative assessment of the pN stage is important for determining an appropriate therapeutic strategy in rectal cancer, but the conventional mriN stage has low sensitivity. Findings Utilization of certain MRI features and multiregional ADCs improves preoperative assessment of the pN stage in RA when compared with conventional MRI assessment. Clinical relevance The novel model, based on preoperative MRI features and multiregional ADC values, can improve the prediction of the pN stage compared to the mriN stage in RA. The combination of this model with the mriN stage helps personalize treatment plans to improve patient prognosis.",2323
40131473,Digital mammography with AI-based computer-aided diagnosis to predict neoadjuvant chemotherapy response in HER2-positive and triple-negative breast cancer patients: comparison with MRI.,European radiology,2025,"To investigate whether digital mammography (DM) with artificial intelligence-based computer-aided diagnosis (AI-CAD) predicts pathologic complete response (pCR) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive and triple-negative (TN) breast cancers and compare performance with dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE)-MRI. In this single-center study, patients who underwent NAC and surgery for HER2-positive or TN cancers between September 2020 and August 2021 were retrospectively selected to develop prediction models for pCR after NAC. From a prospective ASLAN (Avoid axillary Sentinel Lymph node biopsy After Neoadjuvant chemotherapy) trial, HER2-positive and TN cancer patients who underwent NAC and surgery between December 2021 and July 2022 were prospectively selected for model validation. Clinical-pathologic data and DM and MRI scans were obtained before and after NAC. Logistic regression analyses identified factors associated with pCR for model development and four models (clinical-pathologic, MRI, DM-AI-CAD, and combined) were evaluated. A total of 259 women (mean age, 53 years ± 10.5 [SD]) constituted the development cohort and 119 (50.8 years ± 11.1) the validation cohort. Age, clinical N stage, estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and Ki-67 were incorporated into the clinical-pathologic model. In the validation cohort, the DM-AI-CAD model, applying AI-CAD score ≤ 16 on post-NAC DM as the radiologic CR criterion, showed a higher area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) compared to the clinical-pathologic model (0.72 vs. 0.62; p = 0.01) for pCR. However, the MRI model showed the highest AUC (0.83), then the combined model (0.78). The model utilizing post-NAC DM with AI-CAD score ≤ 16 predicted pCR more accurately than the clinical-pathologic model in HER2-positive and TN cancers but was inferior to the MRI model. Question The performance of digital mammography (DM) with AI-based computer-aided diagnosis (AI-CAD) for predicting pathologic complete response (pCR) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is unclear. Findings The DM-AI-CAD model incorporating AI-CAD score ≤ 16 on post-NAC DM predicted pCR more accurately than the clinical-pathologic model but not the MRI model. Clinical relevance The DM-AI-CAD model has potential to predict pCR after NAC in breast cancer patients for whom MRI is unavailable or contraindicated.",2429
40131115,Case 339.,Radiology,2025,"A 66-year-old male patient with a background history of hypertension and no history of liver disease was found to have mildly deranged liver function test results as part of his annual hypertension review. Clinical examination findings were unremarkable, the patient was afebrile (36.8 °C), and other vital observations were within normal limits. Full blood count and urea and creatinine levels were within normal limits; however, liver function tests revealed a mildly elevated alanine aminotransferase level of 61 IU/L (1.02 µkat/L) (reference range, 0-40 IU/L [0-0.67 µkat/L]), and a mildly elevated γ-glutamyltransferase level of 52 IU/L (0.88 µkat/L) (reference range, 0-50 IU/L [0-0.83 µkat/L]). The patient subsequently underwent US examination of the abdomen, which revealed a large liver lesion in an otherwise normal liver with no imaging features of cirrhosis. MRI of the liver was performed for further characterization (Fig 1). The patient subsequently underwent resection of the large mass and surgical pathology. Surveillance MRI was performed 4 months after surgery (Fig 2).",1090
40131114,LI-RADS for Diagnosing Hepatocellular Carcinoma in Patients with Noncirrhotic Chronic Hepatitis C.,Radiology,2025,"Background The Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System (LI-RADS) criteria have not been validated for patients with noncirrhotic chronic hepatitis C (CHC), who are at a greater risk for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) than the general population. Purpose To evaluate the diagnostic performance of LI-RADS category 5 (LR-5, indicating definite HCC) observations for HCC using CT and MRI in patients with noncirrhotic CHC and to compare these findings with those in patients with cirrhotic CHC. Materials and Methods This retrospective study included patients without cirrhosis with CHC with focal hepatic nodules of 1 cm or greater on dynamic CT or MRI scans who underwent pathologic confirmation at two university hospitals from August 2002 to February 2022. This group served as the test dataset. The primary outcome was the diagnostic performance of LR-5 for HCC using CT and MRI. When LI-RADS categorization differed between CT and MRI, the MRI-based classification was used as the definitive category. Results were validated using a dataset of patients with CHC from two additional hospitals based on the clinical composite reference standard. Sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) were calculated. Results The test dataset comprised 458 patients (mean age, 64 years ± 9 [SD]; 350 male; 219 without cirrhosis, 239 with cirrhosis). For noncirrhotic livers, the LR-5 criteria achieved an AUC, accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of 0.90 (95% CI: 0.86, 0.93), 85.1% (95% CI: 80.6, 89.7), 82.4% (95% CI: 77.0, 87.8), 97.6% (95% CI: 93.0, 100.0), 99.4% (95% CI: 98.2, 100.0), and 54.7% (95% CI: 43.4, 65.9), respectively. The AUC for LR-5 observations in diagnosing HCC was higher in the noncirrhotic liver group compared with the cirrhotic liver group (AUC, 0.90 [95% CI: 0.86, 0.93] vs 0.79 [95% CI: 0.74, 0.84]; ",1935
40126606,Synthetic tumor extracellular volume as a predictive biomarker for colorectal liver metastasis patients prior to curative hepatectomy.,European radiology,2025,"This study evaluated the prognostic value of synthetic tumor extracellular volume fraction (ECV) and its association with somatic gene alternations in patients with colorectal liver metastases (CRLM) receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy. This retrospective single-center study included patients undergoing curative hepatectomy after neoadjuvant chemotherapy for CRLM (2013-2020). Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) studies obtained after neoadjuvant chemotherapy were used to calculate synthetic ECV and synthetic hematocrit by linear regression analysis. Patients were grouped according to synthetic ECV cutoff point based on the Youden index. Multivariate analyses were performed with Cox regression models to analyze the prognostic factors of overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS). A total of 209 patients (median age 56 years, 119 men) were enrolled. Synthetic ECV correlated well with conventional ECV (r = 0.996, p < 0.0001) with minimal bias, according to the Bland-Altman analysis (bias = 0.007). The optimal synthetic ECV cutoff point was determined to be 21%, with 115 patients having high ECV and 94 low ECV. Multivariable analysis for predicting high ECV demonstrated significant associations with synchronous CRLM, anti-VEGF agent-containing regimen, and RAS-BRAF mutation (p = 0.022, < 0.001, and = 0.003, respectively). OS and RFS were significantly higher in the high ECV group compared to the low ECV group (p = 0.019 and p = 0.015, respectively). High ECV was independently associated with improved OS (HR 0.55, 95% CI 0.34-0.91) and RFS (HR 0.71, 95% CI 0.52-0.97). Synthetic ECV can help predict OS and RFS in patients undergoing curative-intent CRLM resection after neoadjuvant chemotherapy and could be a useful imaging biomarker to stratify risk. Question There is a need for a biomarker predictive of treatment response after neoadjuvant chemotherapy, prior to curative-intent colorectal liver metastases. Findings Synthetic extracellular volume fraction can help predict overall and recurrence-free survival and is associated with somatic gene alterations. Clinical relevance Prognostic markers of response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in curative-intent colorectal liver metastases include extracellular volume fraction. Synthetic extracellular volume fraction obviates the need for hematocrit; a simplification that is expected to streamline routine clinical practice.",2419
40121344,"Integration of AI lesion classification, age, and BI-RADS assessment to reduce benign biopsies on breast ultrasound.",European radiology,2025,"To develop and test AI-integrated biopsy avoidance strategies to improve the specificity of screening breast ultrasound (US). This retrospective study included consecutive asymptomatic women with BI-RADS 3, 4a, 4b, 4c, or 5 masses on screening breast US exams acquired from two hospitals between December 2019 and December 2020 (development cohort) and June 2020 and December 2020 (external validation cohort). If more than one lesion was present, the most suspicious lesion was analyzed. Logistic regression was used to develop the AI-integrated biopsy avoidance strategies in which BI-RADS 4a masses were downgraded to BI-RADS 3 if the AI classifications were ""both planes benign"" in all women or ""benign and malignant"" in the women ≤ 45 years of age. Diagnostic performance metrics were calculated for both cohorts and compared to initial assessments by radiologists using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test for noninferiority of sensitivity (relative noninferiority margin, 5%) and the McNemar test for specificity. The development and external validation cohorts consisted of 393 women (median age, 45 years [IQR, 40-50 years]) with 101 malignancies and 166 women (median age, 47 years [IQR, 42-51 years]) with 31 malignancies, respectively. The developed strategy improved specificity from 53.3% (72/135; 95% CI: 45.0, 62.1) to 80.7% (109/135; [95% CI: 74.2, 87.5]; p < 0.001) while maintaining sensitivity (both 100% [31/31; 95% CI: 98.9, 100]), and would have avoided 61.7% (37/60 [95% CI: 48.2, 73.7]) of benign biopsies of BI-RADS 4a masses in the external validation cohort. A strategy integrating AI classification in two orthogonal planes, age, and BI-RADS classification improved the specificity of screening breast US while maintaining non-inferior sensitivity. Question How can integrating AI lesion classification, age, and BI-RADS assessment effectively reduce benign biopsies in screening breast ultrasound? Findings A strategy integrating AI classifications, age, and BI-RADS using multivariable logistic regression improved specificity while maintaining non-inferior sensitivity in breast ultrasound screening. Clinical relevance The integration of AI classification in two orthogonal planes, along with patient age and BI-RADS classification, shows potential for reducing benign breast biopsies without compromising sensitivity, leading to more efficient clinical decision-making, reduced patient anxiety, and decreased healthcare resource utilization.",2466
40111496,Effectiveness of noncontrast-abbreviated magnetic resonance imaging in a real-world hepatocellular carcinoma surveillance.,European radiology,2025,"Noncontrast-abbreviated magnetic resonance imaging (NC-AMRI) is emerging as a promising alternative to ultrasound (US) for surveillance of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in at-risk patients. We aimed to assess the effectiveness of NC-AMRI in a real-world surveillance population, and to evaluate the appropriateness of NC-AMRI in selected patients with inadequate prior US. This retrospective study included Child-Pugh class A or B adults with chronic hepatitis B or cirrhosis from any cause who underwent NC-AMRI between December 2018 and August 2022. Early- and very early-stage detection, receipt of curative treatment, and false referral were evaluated. Subgroup analysis was performed for patients with inadequate prior US examinations. Descriptive statistics were used. Among the 1853 patients (mean age, 58.8 years; 1045 males), 68 HCCs developed in 61 (61/1853, 3.3%, 95% confidence interval: 2.5-4.2) patients. The proportions of early- and very early-stage detection were 95.1% (58/61, 72.2-100.0) and 70.5% (43/61, 51.0-95.0); receipt of curative treatment, 67.2% (41/61, 48.2-91.2); and proportion of false referral, 12.9% (9/70, 5.9-24.4). Among the 375 patients with inadequate prior US, the proportions of early- and very early-stage detection were 94.7% (18/19, 56.2-100.0) and 57.9% (11/19, 28.9-100.0); receipt of curative treatment, 52.6% (10/19, 25.2-96.8); and proportion of false referrals, 17.4% (4/23, 4.7-44.5). NC-AMRI may be an effective HCC surveillance modality given the results related to early- and very early-stage detection, receipt of curative treatment, and false referral. NC-AMRI can be an alternative HCC surveillance strategy, especially for patients with inadequate prior US examinations. Question There is insufficient evidence to support the use of noncontrast-abbreviated MRI as an effective surveillance tool in large real-life populations under surveillance. Findings Using noncontrast-abbreviated MRI, most patients who developed HCCs during surveillance were diagnosed at an early stage, with an acceptable false referral rate of 12.9%. Clinical relevance Noncontrast-abbreviated MRI is an effective HCC surveillance modality, especially for patients with inadequate prior ultrasound examinations.",2245
40111495,"Preoperative estimation of the pathological breast tumor size in architectural distortions: a comparison of DM, DBT, US, CEM, and MRI.",European radiology,2025,"This study aims to compare the accuracy of digital mammography (DM), digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT), ultrasound (US), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and contrast-enhanced mammography (CEM) in the preoperative evaluation of breast cancer size in architectural distortions (ADs). Additionally, it assesses whether including thin spicules in mammography measurements affects accuracy. We planned a retrospective analysis of invasive breast cancers presenting as ADs in our breast screening program between 2018 and 2022. Tumor size was measured in mm using DM, DBT, US, MRI, and CEM. Measurements were compared to the surgical specimen sizes. Two measurement approaches for DM and DBT were applied, considering and not considering thin spicules. T-student test was used to compare mean sizes across imaging techniques with the surgical specimen. The study encompassed 59 female patients with 63 ADs. Mean age was 60.1 years (Standard Deviation (SD): 6.3). The cancers included four histological subtypes, ductal (69.8%), lobular (23.8%), tubular (4.8%), and micropapillary (1.6%). All imaging techniques, except for US (mean: 12.4 mm, SD: 5.7), overestimated tumor size compared to histology (mean: 16.40 mm, SD: 9). CEM, MRI, and DBT without thin spicules closely matched histological size. Including thin spicules in DM and DBT led to overestimation. Concordance was highest with CEM (75%) and MRI (67.6%). No significant differences were found between ductal and lobular carcinoma. For preoperative tumor size estimation of breast cancer in ADs, DBT excluding thin spicules, CEM, and MRI seemed most accurate. Including thin spicules in mammography leads to overestimation. Question Identifying the most accurate imaging technique for preoperative tumor staging of architectural distortions (ADs) is crucial now that contrast-enhanced mammography (CEM) is widely implemented. Findings Measuring thin wispy spicules in ADs on digital (DM) and digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) should be avoided, as they consistently overestimate pathological tumor stage. Clinical relevance Precise tumor size estimation in ADs is critical for proper staging and treatment planning. This study favors the use of DBT excluding thin spicules, CEM, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for optimal accuracy.",2295

This retrospective study included NPC patients who underwent multiphasic contrast‑enhanced DECT (comprising non-contrast, arterial, and venous phase scanning) between May 2019 and December 2023. The relationships between quantitative DECT-derived parameters and treatment response to induction chemotherapy were analyzed using logistic regression analysis. The predictive performance of a nomogram integrating key predictors was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC).

We reviewed pre- and post-CAR-T cell therapy brain MRIs of B-ALL patients aged 25 years or younger who underwent therapy between April 2015 and October 2023 at a single institution. MRI abnormalities were categorized as no change, exacerbation of preexisting lesion, or newly developed lesion. Clinical CAR-mediated toxicities, including cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) grades, were recorded. Patients were grouped into those with and without 'exacerbated/new lesion,' and clinical and neurological symptoms were compared using Fisher's exact test. Sixteen patients with pre- and post-CAR brain MRIs (median age 16 years [interquartile range, 11-21]; 9 males, 7 females) were included in the analysis. Post-CAR brain abnormalities were observed in 81% (13/16) of patients, including white matter (WM) signal changes (12/16), leptomeningeal enhancement (1/16), and cerebellar embolic infarction (1/16). Of the post-CAR WM lesions, 50% (6/12) were exacerbated, 33% (4/12) were newly developed, and 17% (2/12) remained unchanged compared to pre-CAR brain MRI. No difference in CRS (p = 0.079) or ICANS grades (p > 0.99) was observed between patients with and without 'exacerbated/new lesions'. Children and young adults with B-ALL can develop brain MRI abnormalities after CAR T-cell therapy, predominantly WM signal changes. These brain abnormalities did not show an association with higher CRS or ICANS grade. Question Brain MRI findings after chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy for B-cell acute lymphoid leukemia (B-ALL) and their association with clinical and neurological symptoms are not well understood. Findings Brain MRI abnormalities, mostly white matter changes, were seen in 81% of patients but were not associated with CAR-mediated toxicities. Clinical relevance Brain MRI abnormalities, commonly observed post-CAR T-cell therapy, do not correlate with the severity of CAR-related toxicities, aiding in the clinical management and monitoring of these patients.",2268

This study investigated clinicopathological and imaging findings that predict metastatic etiology of PSMA-avid rib lesions. Consecutive patients with prostate cancer that underwent PET/CT with [ One hundred and seventy-five men (median 71 years, IQR 65-77) with PSMA-avid rib lesions were included; 47/175 (26.9%) had rib metastases. Only 1/47 (2.1%) of these patients had isolated rib metastasis without PSMA-avid metastases in other bones, nodes, or visceral organs; the other 46/47 (97.9%) patients with rib metastases also had other sites of PSMA-avid disease. Patients with rib metastases were older, had higher prostate-specific antigen levels, and higher-grade tumors (p < 0.01). Metastatic rib lesions had higher uptake (SUV Several imaging and clinicopathological factors differed between PSMA-avid metastatic and benign lesions. Isolated rib lesions without other sites of metastasis are almost always benign. Careful assessment of CT features can help diagnose benign lesions. Question While prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-PET/CT has become integral to the management of prostate cancer, PSMA-avid rib lesions pose a diagnostic challenge. Findings Approximately a quarter of patients who had PSMA-avid rib lesions were metastatic. However, only 2.1% of them had isolated rib metastasis (without PSMA-avid metastases elsewhere). Clinical relevance Isolated PSMA-avid rib lesions are almost always benign when there is no evidence of metastatic disease elsewhere.

40108012,Preoperative breast MRI in HER2-positive/hormone receptor-negative breast cancer: surgical outcomes using propensity score matching.,European radiology,2025,"To examine the association between preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and surgical outcomes in human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive/hormone receptor (HR)-negative breast cancer through a propensity score (PS)-matched analysis. Patients with HER2-positive/HR-negative invasive ductal carcinoma between 2007 and 2014 were retrospectively assessed and compared according to whether they underwent preoperative MRI. Inverse probability weighting (IPW) analysis and PS matching were used to adjust 17 covariates to control between the MRI and no-MRI groups. Surgical outcomes were compared between two groups and clinicopathologic variables were evaluated to determine who benefited from MRI. Among 965 women (mean age ± standard deviation, 52 years ± 10), 423 (44%) underwent preoperative MRI and 542 (56%) did not. In the MRI group, a change in surgical management occurred in 48 patients (11%), and the change was appropriate in 31 of those patients (65%). The MRI group had a lower odds of initial mastectomy (odds ratio [OR], 0.63; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.47, 0.84; p = 0.002 and OR, 0.67; 95% CI: 0.48, 0.92; p = 0.01 for IPW and PS matching, respectively) and overall mastectomy (OR, 0.60; 95% [CI]: 0.45, 0.80; p = 0.001 and OR, 0.68; 95% CI: 0.49, 0.93; p = 0.02 for IPW and PS matching, respectively). In the subgroup analysis, asymptomatic patients or those with multifocal or multicentric lesions benefited more from MRI (61% vs 36%, p = 0.006 and 52% vs 31%, p = 0.02, respectively). Patients with HER2-positive/HR-negative breast cancer who received preoperative MRI had a lower likelihood of undergoing mastectomy. Question The role of preoperative MRI in predicting surgical outcomes in patients with HER2-positive/HR-negative breast cancer remains uncertain. Findings Preoperative MRI in HER2-positive/HR-negative breast cancer reduces mastectomy rates without increasing the positive resection margin or reoperation rate. Clinical relevance Preoperative MRI is beneficial in reducing mastectomy rates in women with HER2-positive/HR-negative breast cancer.",2107
40100399,The value of multiparametric functional MRI histogram features in assessing multiple myeloma activity.,European radiology,2025,"To investigate the application of histogram features of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), mean diffusion coefficient (MD), mean kurtosis (MK), and fat fraction (FF) for assessing multiple myeloma (MM) activity. From April 2023 to December 2023, 24 multiple myeloma patients who underwent zonally oblique multi-slice diffusion-weighted imaging (ZOOM-DWI), zonally oblique multi-slice diffusion kurtosis imaging (ZOOM-DKI), and modified Dixon quantification imaging (mDixon-Quant) were enrolled in this retrospective study. Histogram features of ADC, MD, MK, and FF were analyzed. Significant variables were selected for multivariate logistic regression analysis using a backward stepwise selection method. The diagnostic efficacies of individual histogram features and combined models were evaluated by the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) and the area under the curve (AUC). A total of 24 participants were enrolled in this study, 12 males and 12 females, with an age range of 39-73 (57.88 ± 8.55) years. The ADC and MD histogram features did not correlate with the disease status in multiple myeloma, whereas the MK and FF histogram features were significantly associated with the disease status (p < 0.05). MK_InterquartileRange and FF_Median had the highest AUC values in multiple myeloma activity assessment. The differences in diagnostic efficacies between MK_InterquartileRange and FF_Median, MK_InterquartileRange and the MK model, FF_Median and the FF model, the MK model and the FF model were not statistically different (p = 0.70, 0.54, 0.09 and 0.09, respectively). Histogram features of MK and FF are valuable in assessing disease activity in multiple myeloma patients. Question Accurate assessment of the disease status of multiple myeloma is crucial for enhancing individualized treatment, yet current non-invasive tools remain inadequate. Findings Mean kurtosis (MK) and fat fraction (FF) histogram features are associated with disease activity of multiple myeloma, providing rich and accurate parameters for assessing the disease status. Clinical relevance The MK and FF histogram features facilitate non-invasive assessment of multiple myeloma activity, potentially guiding the development of personalized treatment strategies.",2261
40100398,Dual-energy CT for evaluating the tumor regression grade of gastric cancer after neoadjuvant chemotherapy.,European radiology,2025,"To evaluate the clinical value of dual-energy CT (DECT) parameters in estimating tumor regression grade (TRG) of gastric cancer after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). In this retrospective study, the patients with pathologically confirmed gastric cancer were classified into two groups based on TRG results: the effective group and the ineffective group. DECT parameters, including iodine concentration (IC), normalized iodine concentration (NIC), and slope of the energy spectrum curve (λ), were obtained. Quantitative parameters and their change rates were compared before and after chemotherapy. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were plotted. A total of 54 patients were included and divided into the effective group (n = 21) and the ineffective group (n = 33). After NAC, the change rates of parameters in the venous phase (%ΔIC-v, %ΔNIC-v, and %Δλ-v) were notably higher in the effective group were higher than in the ineffective group (all p < 0.05). The consistency between the response evaluation criteria in solid tumors version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) and TRG was fair, with a Kappa value of 0.299 (p < 0.05). The %ΔIC-v, %ΔIC-d, %ΔNIC-v, %ΔNIC-d, and %Δλ-v exhibited moderate or strong correlations with TRG, with correlation coefficients (r) of -0.624, -0.475, -0.766, -0.516, and -0.431, respectively (all p < 0.05). %ΔNIC-v achieved a significantly greater area under the curve (AUC) compared to RECIST 1.1 (AUC, 0.877; 95% CI: 0.772-0.957; vs AUC, 0.649; 95% CI: 0.496-0.803; p < 0.05) for estimating TRG in gastric cancer. DECT parameters, particularly %ΔNIC-v, show promise in assessing the efficacy of NAC for gastric cancer. Question Two-dimensional morphological change is insufficient for accurately assessing the pathological TRG following NAC in gastric cancer. Findings DECT parameters show higher preoperative predictive efficacy than RECIST 1.1 for TRG in gastric cancer. Clinical relevance DECT-derived quantitative parameters offer a reliable and noninvasive tool for the preoperative prediction of pathological response in gastric cancer patients undergoing NAC.",2101
40100397,CT-based scores for extramural vascular invasion and occult peritoneal metastasis correlate with gastric cancer survival.,European radiology,2025,"To assess the feasibility of scoring extragastric vascular invasion and occult peritoneal metastasis using preoperative computed tomography (CT) images of gastric cancer (GC) and to explore the correlation between these scores and patient prognosis. 587 GC patients with CT scans from two centers, all confirmed by pathology, were retrospectively evaluated. Scores for CT-detected blood vessel invasion (ctBVI), lymphatic invasion (ctLVI), and occult peritoneal metastasis (ctOPM) were assigned based on preoperative CT images. The patients' follow-up provided data on overall and disease-free survival. Cox proportional hazard models were used to analyze prognostic factors. The inter-group and intra-group consistency of ctBVL, ctLVI, and ctOPM scores were all > 0.70. Log-rank analysis demonstrated a statistically significant difference in survival curves (p < 0.001). CtBVL, ctLVI, and ctOPM scores were related to overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS). Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses identified ctBVL, ctLVI, ctOPM scores as independent risk factors for GC prognosis. In multivariate analysis, the three sign scores were related to DFS (p < 0.05), with ctBVL (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.980, 95% CI: 1.336-2.933), ctLVI (HR = 1.502, 95% CI: 1.336-2.933), and ctOPM (HR = 1.182, 95% CI: 0.886-1.578). The three scores were also correlated with OS (p < 0.05), ctBVL (HR = 2.003, 95% CI: 1.278-3.139), ctLVI (HR = 1.523, 95% CI:1.055-2.200) and ctOPM (HR = 1.289, 95% CI: 1.013-1.770). CtBVL, ctLVI, and ctOPM scores are valuable prognostic indicators in gastric cancer, influencing both OS and DFS. Question To study whether the ctBVL, ctLVI, and ctOPM scores assessed by preoperative enhanced CT imaging can predict the survival outcomes of patients. Findings CtBVL, ctLVI, and ctOPM scores, assessed via preoperative enhanced CT imaging, are associated with worse survival outcomes when elevated. Clinical relevance CtBVL, ctLVI, and ctOPM scores may help guide personalized follow-up plans. Patients with higher scores might require closer monitoring and more aggressive treatment.",2120
40100021,Human-AI Interaction in the ScreenTrustCAD Trial: Recall Proportion and Positive Predictive Value Related to Screening Mammograms Flagged by AI CAD versus a Human Reader.,Radiology,2025,"Background The ScreenTrustCAD trial was a prospective study that evaluated the cancer detection rates for combinations of artificial intelligence (AI) computer-aided detection (CAD) and two radiologists. The results raised concerns about the tendency of radiologists to agree with AI CAD too much (when AI CAD made an erroneous flagging) or too little (when AI CAD made a correct flagging). Purpose To evaluate differences in recall proportion and positive predictive value (PPV) related to which reader flagged the mammogram for consensus discussion: AI CAD and/or radiologists. Materials and Methods Participants were enrolled from April 2021 to June 2022, and each examination was interpreted by three independent readers: two radiologists and AI CAD, after which positive findings were forwarded to the consensus discussion. For each combination of readers flagging an examination, the proportion recalled and the PPV were calculated by dividing the number of pathologic evaluation-verified cancers by the number of positive examinations. Results The study included 54 991 women (median age, 55 years [IQR, 46-65 years]), among whom 5489 were flagged for consensus discussion and 1348 were recalled. For examinations flagged by one reader, the proportion recalled after flagging by one radiologist was larger (14.2% [263 of 1858]) compared with flagging by AI CAD (4.6% [86 of 1886]) (",1389
40094419,Visualization of P2X7 Receptors in Living Human Gliomas: An 18F-GSK1482160 PET Imaging and Neuropathology Study.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,2025,"PET imaging targeting the purinergic receptor subtype 7 (P2X7R) is of high interest for assessing the glioma microenvironment. No reports were published with regard to the P2X7R imaging in gliomas. Therefore, we compared the uptake characteristics of 18F-GSK1482160, a novel P2X7R ligand, to conventional methyl-11C-methionine (11C-MET) PET and contrast-enhanced MRI in patients with gliomas. Thirteen patients with glioma (8 grade II and 5 grade III/IV) at initial diagnosis were consecutively included and underwent 18F-GSK1482160 PET, 11C-MET PET, and MRI. The semiquantitative analyses were performed in both 18F-GSK1482160 and 11C-MET PET images. Dynamic 18F-GSK1482160 PET analysis (n = 8) generated parametric maps of binding potential for the lesions. The tumor tissue was quantitatively assessed for P2X7R expression and infiltration of glioma-associated microglia/macrophages. The multilinear reference tissue model was sufficient for quantifying 18F-GSK1482160. The mean standardized uptake value ratio for the duration of 50 to 70 minutes correlated best with mean binding potential in the dynamic scan analysis. A strong linear relationship between the uptakes of 18F-GSK1482160 and 11C-MET was observed. The two tracers showed distinct spatial distribution by metabolic volume comparison but were both associated with tumor grade and lesion contrast-enhancement status. IDH wild-type gliomas tended to have higher tracer uptake for both tracers without reaching the level of significance. P2X7R in gliomas was expressed predominately by glioma-associated microglia/macrophages, and its expression exhibited positive correlation with uptake of 18F-GSK1482160 (r = 0.7783; P = 0.0029) in the tumors. The first-in-man study of P2X7R PET demonstrated that PET with 18F-GSK1482160 and 11C-MET provides complementary information, characterizing tumor heterogeneity and the cellular composition of the microenvironment in untreated gliomas.",1947
40090215,AI integrations with lung cancer screening: Considerations in developing AI in a public health setting.,"European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",2025,"Lung cancer screening implementation has led to expanded imaging of the chest in older, tobacco-exposed populations. Growing numbers of screening cases are also found to have CT-detectable emphysema or elevated levels of coronary calcium, indicating the presence of coronary artery disease. Early interventions based on these additional findings, especially with coronary calcium, are emerging and follow established protocols. Given the pace of diagnostic innovation and the potential public health impact, it is timely to review issues in developing useful chest CT screening infrastructure as chest CT screening will soon involve millions of participants worldwide. Lung cancer screening succeeds because it detects curable, early primary lung cancer by characterizing and measuring changes in non-calcified, lung nodules in the size-range from 3mm to 15 mm in diameter. Therefore, close attention to imaging methodology is essential to lung screening success and similar image quality issues are required for reliable quantitative characterization of early emphysema and coronary artery disease. Today's emergence of advanced image analysis using artificial intelligence (AI) is disrupting many aspects of medical imaging including chest CT screening. Given these emerging technological and volume trends, a major concern is how to balance the diverse needs of parties committed to building AI tools for precise, reproducible, and economical chest CT screening, while addressing the public health needs of screening participants receiving this service.

40088287,"Correlation between tumor stroma ratio, prognosis, and apparent diffusion coefficient in alveolar soft part sarcoma.",European radiology,2025,"To investigate the correlation between tumor stroma ratio (TSR) and survival in patients with alveolar soft part sarcoma (ASPS), and the application of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) histogram parameters in assessing TSR. This retrospective study collected 61 patients from May 2015 to December 2018. TSR was classified as stroma-rich (low TSR) or stroma-poor (high TSR) based on histology. The correlation between TSR and clinicopathological characteristics was analyzed. Prognostic value for 5-year progression-free survival (5-PFS) and 5-year overall survival (5-OS) were assessed using Kaplan-Meier analysis, log-rank test, and Cox regression. Independent sample t-tests or Mann-Whitney U-test and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis examined TSR and ADC histogram parameters. Sixty-one patients met the inclusion criteria (mean age 25.5 ± 12.2 years; 30 males, 31 females). Low TSR was significantly associated with lymph node metastasis (p = 0.048). In multivariate analysis, low TSR was an independent adverse prognostic factor for 5-PFS (hazard ratios [HR] and 95% = 10.456, 95% confidence intervals [CI]: 1.816-60.208, p = 0.009) and 5-OS (HR = 4.789, 95% CI: 1.164-19.708, p = 0.030). Significant differences were found in ADC TSR is an independent prognostic factor for PFS and OS in ASPS patients. ADC histogram parameters serve as imaging biomarkers for evaluating TSR. Question The prognostic value of TSR in ASPS remains unclear, with limited imaging biomarkers available for assessment. Findings Low TSR is associated with poorer 5-PFS and OS. ADC histogram parameters aid in TSR evaluation. Clinical relevance TSR as a prognostic factor, assessed through ADC histogram parameters, offers a non-invasive imaging method that may be useful in predicting the progression of alveolar soft tissue sarcoma.",1835
40088286,On-table monitoring of prostate MRI could enable tailored utilisation of gadolinium contrast.,European radiology,2025,"To compare the impact of on-table monitoring vs standard-of-care multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) for the utilisation of gadolinium contrast use in prostate MRI. This retrospective observation study of prospectively acquired data was conducted at a single institution over an 18-month period. A cohort of patients undergoing MRI for suspected prostate cancer (PCa) underwent on-table monitoring where their T2 and DWI images were reviewed by a supervising radiologist during the scan to decide whether to acquire dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) sequences. MRI scans were reported using PI-RADS v2.1, patients were followed up with biopsy for at least 12 months. The rate of gadolinium administration, biopsy rates, and diagnostic accuracy were compared to that of a standard-of-care control group undergoing mpMRI during the same period using propensity score matching. Estimates of cost savings were also calculated. 1410 patients were identified and after propensity score matching 598 patients were analysed, with 178 undergoing on-table monitoring. Seventy-five and eight tenths (135/178) of patients did not receive gadolinium. Contrast was used mainly for indeterminate lesions (27/43) and significant artefacts on bpMRI (14/43). When comparing the monitored cohort to a non-monitored control group, there was a comparable number of biopsies performed (52.2% vs 49.5%, p = 0.54), PI-RADS 3/5 scoring rates (10.1% vs 7.4%, p = 0.27), sensitivity (98.3% vs 99.2%, p = 0.56), and specificity (63.9% vs 70.7%, p = 0.18) for detection of clinically-significant PCa. When acquired, DCE was deemed helpful in 67.4% (29/43) of cases and improved both PI-QUALv2 and reader confidence scores. There was an estimated saving of £56,677 over the 18-month study. On-table monitoring significantly reduced the need for gadolinium contrast without compromising diagnostic accuracy and biopsy rates. Question Default use of gadolinium contrast in prostate MRI is not always of clinical benefit and has associated side effects and healthcare costs. Findings On-table monitoring avoided the use of gadolinium in 75.8% of patients, reducing associated costs whilst maintaining clinically significant cancer detection, and diagnostic accuracy and improving reader confidence. Clinical relevance On-table monitoring offers personalised patient protocolling with a significant reduction in the use of gadolinium and its associated side effects and costs, potentially maximising the advantages of both multiparametric and biparametric prostate MRI.",2525

40067105,MRI-based Deep Learning Algorithm for Assisting Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer Detection: A Bicenter Prospective Study.,Radiology,2025,"Background Although artificial intelligence is actively being developed for prostate MRI, few studies have prospectively validated these tools. Purpose To compare the diagnostic performance of a commercial deep learning algorithm (DLA) and radiologists' clinical reports for cancer detection in participants from two hospitals using histopathologic findings from biopsy specimens as the reference standard. Materials and Methods This prospective bicenter study enrolled participants suspected of having prostate cancer (PCa) who were scheduled for biopsy based on clinical information, including prostate MRI, from December 2022 to July 2023. Targeted prostate biopsies were performed for lesions with Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) scores of 3 or higher, identified by either radiologists or the DLA. PI-RADS classifications by radiologists (using all imaging sequences), the DLA (using biparametric MRI), and the scenario in which radiologist-based PI-RADS 3 scores were modulated with DLA-based PI-RADS scores were compared using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) with DeLong and McNemar tests. Results A total of 259 lesions, including 117 clinically significant PCas (csPCas) (Gleason grade group ≥2), were evaluated in 205 men (median age, 68 years; age range, 47-90 years). At per-lesion analysis, the DLA had a lower sensitivity (94 of 117; 80%) and higher positive predictive value (PPV) (94 of 163; 58%) for detecting csPCa than did the radiologists (109 of 117 [93%] and 109 of 227 [48%]; ",1553
40067102,US Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System Version 2017: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,Radiology,2025,"Background The US Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System (LI-RADS) includes an assessment category (US-1, negative; US-2, subthreshold; and US-3, positive) and a visualization score reflecting image quality (VIS-A, no or minimal limitations; VIS-B, moderate limitations; and VIS-C, severe limitations). The US-3 and VIS-C impact patient treatment. Purpose To establish the distributions of categories and visualization scores, estimate the proportions of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and overall malignancy in the US-3 category, and identify variables associated with the VIS-C score by conducting a meta-analysis. Materials and Methods A systematic search of articles published between January 1, 2017, and September 17, 2023, identified studies reporting distributions of US LI-RADS version 2017 categories or visualization scores. Characteristics of the study design, patient cohorts, and outcomes of interest (distributions of US categories and visualization scores, percentages of probable or definite HCC and malignancy in US-3 category, and variables associated with VIS-C) were extracted. For the meta-analysis, estimates were established with random-effects models. Results Fifteen studies comprising 39 166 US examinations were included. Of all examinations, 89.7% (95% CI: 86.8, 91.8) were categorized US-1; 4.4% (95% CI: 2.8, 6.2), US-2; and 5.9% (95% CI: 4.1, 8.0), US-3. Of the US-3 examinations, 25.9% (95% CI: 17.1, 34.7) had probable or definite HCC and 26.4% (95% CI: 18.4, 34.5) had overall malignancy. Among all examinations, 59.7% (95% CI: 46.9, 67.8) were assigned VIS-A; 32.5% (95% CI: 21.9, 41.6), VIS-B; and 7.8% (95% CI: 2.8, 14.3), VIS-C. Obesity (odds ratio [OR], 2.37; 95% CI: 1.57, 3.59), nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) (OR, 2.24; 95% CI: 1.64, 3.06), and Child-Pugh B or C (OR, 2.41; 95% CI: 1.43, 4.06) were associated with VIS-C score. Conclusion Overall, 90% of surveillance US results were negative (US-1), and 92% were of adequate quality (VIS-A or VIS-B); 26% of patients with US-3 results had HCC.

40055232,Diagnostic performance of contrast-enhanced US in small liver nodules not conclusively characterized after MRI in cirrhotic patients.,European radiology,2025,"In patients at risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), new focal liver lesions identified at ultrasound screening require further characterization by CT or MRI. If these techniques cannot conclusively characterize a lesion, a biopsy or an alternative imaging modality such as contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) is considered. We aimed to determine the diagnostic yield of CEUS in a sequential noninvasive diagnostic strategy for solitary nodules ≤ 20 mm detected in cirrhotic patients during US surveillance characterized as inconclusive on MRI. Post hoc analysis of a single-center prospective cohort of high-risk patients (Child A or B) with no prior history of HCC and new liver nodules (≤ 20 mm) detected on screening US who underwent CEUS after inconclusive MRI (LI-RADS-2, LI-RADS-3, LI-RADS-4, or LI-RADS-M) between January 2006 and February 2017. We compared the characterization of nodules by LI-RADS v.2018 alone vs characterization after considering subsequent CEUS-LR v.2017 against the final diagnosis by biopsy or follow-up. Of the 75 nodules included, CEUS upgraded 45 (63.4%); of these, 13 nodules classified as LR3 or LR4 at MRI were classified as CEUS-LR5. Altogether, 15 (21.1%) nodules inconclusive on MRI were classified as CEUS-LR5. CEUS yielded 37.5% (95% CI: 22.73‒54.20%) sensitivity and 100% specificity (95% CI: 88.78-100%) for HCC. Adding CEUS to the workup of liver nodules with inconclusive MRI findings demonstrated high specificity for HCC, particularly benefiting nodules categorized as LR3 at MRI. Question MRI's limited sensitivity in diagnosing small HCCs in cirrhotic patients results in inconclusive classification of a high proportion of screening-detected lesions. Findings Adding CEUS to the work-up for inconclusive liver nodules at MRI yielded 100% specificity (95% CI: 88.78-100%) and 37.5% (95% CI: 22.73-54.20%) sensitivity for the HCC diagnosis. Clinical relevance CEUS is a valuable problem-solving tool in the work-up of small liver nodules with inconclusive MRI findings in cirrhotic patients.",2044

This multicenter observational study included four average volume centers in two countries. Data for the PEARL cohort were prospectively collected between January 2022 and May 2023, while the control cohort data were retrospectively collected from procedures performed between June 2021 and April 2022. Patient demographics, lesion characteristics, intraprocedural data, complications, and procedural accuracy were compared. A total of 413 CT-guided lung biopsies were performed (204 PEARL vs 209 Control) without differences in patient demographics, lesion size (26.8 mm ± 20.3 PEARL group vs 27.7 mm ± 19.6 Control, p = 0.4), or emphysema rate (34% PEARL vs 27% Control, p = 0.15). Adequate pathological yield was observed in both groups (PEARL group 95%, Control group 97%; p = 0.255). The overall incidence of pneumothorax was 9% (18/204) in the PEARL vs 23% in the control group (48/209); p < 0.05. Chest tube insertion was necessary in one patient in the PEARL group (0.5%), and in nine in the Control (4%); p = 0.011. Application of PEARL protocol for CT-guided percutaneous biopsy of lung nodules provides a reproducible method across multiple institutions and physicians to maintain a high diagnostic yield while significantly reducing pneumothorax risk. Question Reducing the rate of pneumothorax following percutaneous lung biopsy is crucial. The PEARL approach was proposed in an interventional radiology single-center study; external validation still missing. Findings The PEARL approach effectively reduced pneumothorax incidence, with only one chest tube insertion in 204 cases, and both groups demonstrated adequate pathological yield. Clinical relevance The PEARL protocol demonstrated efficiency and cost-effectiveness in minimizing pneumothorax risk during percutaneous CT-guided lung biopsies in a multicenter study, with board-certified radiologists using standard CT equipment in average-volume centers.",2109
40055229,AI and human interactions in prostate cancer diagnosis using MRI.,European radiology,2025,"This special report explores the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into prostate MRI workflows to address limitations associated with single-reader interpretations, such as inter-reader variability and diagnostic errors. We review various AI-integrated workflow strategies, from AI-assisted decision support to fully autonomous analysis, examining their benefits and challenges. AI can act as a second reader, enhancing detection sensitivity and reducing false negatives or pre-screen cases for efficient triage, thereby optimising radiologist workload. Key advantages include the potential for improved lesion detection, streamlined workflows, and reduced reporting times. However, challenges such as automation bias and the potential for inaccurate AI outputs require careful consideration and mitigation strategies. The suitability of different AI workflows is dependent on the clinical context and desired performance, with high sensitivity and negative predictive value crucial for rule-out scenarios and high specificity and positive predictive value essential for rule-in scenarios. Increased AI autonomy mandates a higher performance benchmark. The need for rigorous prospective validation studies assessing AI safety and effectiveness in real-world clinical settings is emphasised. Furthermore, the complex dynamics of human-AI interaction, encompassing positive and negative consequences, warrant further investigation. Ultimately, the strategic implementation of collaborative AI-radiologist workflows has the potential to enhance diagnostic accuracy and efficiency and reduce missed cancers, leading to more timely and appropriate patient care. KEY POINTS: Question Single-reader prostate MRI interpretations have reader variability and missed cancer limitations. This report explores how prospective AI integration can improve diagnostic accuracy and workflow efficiency. Findings From decision support to autonomous analyses, AI workflows can improve cancer detection and streamline workflows. Mitigating errors requires tailored performance and high accuracy for greater autonomy. Clinical relevance Calibrated AI-radiologist collaborations can enhance prostate cancer diagnosis by improving accuracy and efficiency while reducing unnecessary biopsies and missed cancers.

40050456,Deep learning-based quantification of T2-FLAIR mismatch sign: extending IDH mutation prediction in adult-type diffuse lower-grade glioma.,European radiology,2025,"To investigate the predictive value of the quantitative T2-FLAIR mismatch ratio (qT2FM) with fully automated tumor segmentation in adult-type diffuse lower-grade gliomas (LGGs). This retrospective study included 218 consecutive patients (mean age, 47 years ± 15 [SD]; 125 males) diagnosed with adult-type diffuse LGG. The cohort was classified into IDH wild-type (IDHwt), IDH-mutant with 1p/19q-codeletion (IDHmut-Codel), and IDH-mutant without 1p/19q-codeletion (IDHmut-Noncodel) subtypes. Tumor masks were obtained using deep learning-based segmentation, and qT2FM was calculated from the differences in signal intensity ratios on T2 and FLAIR images. Multivariable logistic regression identified predictors for identifying IDHmut-Noncodel and IDH mutation status. Point-biserial correlations were analyzed between qualitative and quantitative T2FM, and median apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) value. Diagnostic performance was evaluated with a receiver operating characteristic curve. The IDHmut-Noncodel group had a higher qT2FM (0.37 ± 0.38, p = 0.004) than the IDHmut-Codel (0.24 ± 0.39) and IDHwt groups (0.07 ± 0.62). The qT2FM was the only independent imaging predictor for identifying IDHmut-Noncodel (OR = 3.43, 95% CI: 1.30-9.05, p = 0.01). Independent predictors of IDH mutation were younger age (p < 0.001), frontal lobe location (p = 0.007), cortical involvement (p < 0.001), and higher qT2FM (p = 0.034). The qT2FM significantly correlated with visual T2FM (vT2FM) and median ADC value. Adding qT2FM to vT2FM improved performance in identifying IDHmut-Noncodel (AUC 0.77, 95% CI: 0.70-0.82) and IDH mutation status (AUC 0.77, 95% CI: 0.71-0.83) than each parameter alone. The qT2FM ratio, derived from deep learning-based tumor segmentation, is a valuable predictor for identifying IDH mutation status and the IDHmut-Noncodel subtype in patients with adult-type diffuse LGG. Question Does deep-learning-based quantification of the T2-FLAIR mismatch sign provide accurate prediction of IDH-mutant, 1p/19q non-codeleted astrocytomas and enhance identification of IDH mutation status? Findings Quantifying the T2-FLAIR mismatch sign with a fully automated segmentation tool achieved high accuracy in identifying IDH-mutant, 1p/19q non-codeleted astrocytomas, and enhanced IDH status prediction. Clinical relevance Integrating the qT2FM into clinical protocols enhances diagnostic precision and guides treatment strategies, underscoring the role of advanced imaging in neuro-oncology.",2500
40045072,Enhancing the role of MRI in rectal cancer: advances from staging to prognosis prediction.,European radiology,2025,"Rectal cancer (RC) is one of the major health challenges worldwide. Accurate staging, restaging, invasiveness assessment, and treatment efficacy evaluation are crucial for its clinical management. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) plays a significant role in these processes. However, standard MRI techniques, including T2-weighted and diffusion-weighted imaging, have uncertainties in identifying early-stage tumors, high-risk nodules, extramural vascular invasion, and treatment efficacy, potentially leading to inappropriate treatment. Recent advances suggest that the integration of traditional MRI methods, including diffusion-weighted imaging, opposed-phase or contrast-enhanced T1-weighted imaging, as well as emerging synthetic MRI, could address these challenges. Additionally, improvements in imaging technology have spurred research into advanced functional MRI techniques such as diffusion kurtosis imaging and amide proton transfer weighted MRI, yielding promising results in RC assessment. Total neoadjuvant therapy has emerged as a new treatment paradigm for locally advanced RC, with neoadjuvant immunotherapy and chemotherapy offering viable alternatives to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. However, the lack of standards for the early prediction of patient survival and tumor response to neoadjuvant therapy highlights a critical unmet need in matching therapies to suitable patients. Furthermore, organ preservation strategies after neoadjuvant therapy provide personalized options based on tumor response and patient preferences, yet traditional MRI assessments show significant variability. Radiomics and artificial intelligence hold promise for revealing complex patterns in MRI images associated with patient prognosis and treatment response. This review provides an overview of current MRI advancements in RC assessment and emphasizes how future research can refine tailored treatment strategies to improve patient outcomes. KEY POINTS: Question The accurate diagnosis of early-stage rectal tumors, high-risk nodules, treatment responses, and the early prediction of patient survival and therapeutic outcomes remain an unmet need. Findings Visual MRI has improved staging, restaging, and invasiveness evaluation. Advanced MRI, radiomics and artificial intelligence provide significant potential for tumor characterization and outcome prediction. Clinical relevance Advances in visual MRI are improving routine imaging protocols and radiomics and artificial intelligence show promise in enhancing treatment decisions through precise tumor characterization and outcome prediction.",2599
40042650,Artificial intelligence for the detection of airway nodules in chest CT scans.,European radiology,2025,"Incidental airway tumors are rare and can easily be overlooked on chest CT, especially at an early stage. Therefore, we developed and assessed a deep learning-based artificial intelligence (AI) system for detecting and localizing airway nodules. At a single academic hospital, we retrospectively analyzed cancer diagnoses and radiology reports from patients who received a chest or chest-abdomen CT scan between 2004 and 2020 to find cases presenting as airway nodules. Primary cancers were verified through bronchoscopy with biopsy or cytologic testing. The malignancy status of other nodules was confirmed with bronchoscopy only or follow-up CT scans if such evidence was unavailable. An AI system was trained and evaluated with a ten-fold cross-validation procedure. The performance of the system was assessed with a free-response receiver operating characteristic curve. We identified 160 patients with airway nodules (median age of 64 years [IQR: 54-70], 58 women) and added a random sample of 160 patients without airway nodules (median age of 60 years [IQR: 48-69], 80 women). The sensitivity of the AI system was 75.1% (95% CI: 67.6-81.6%) for detecting all nodules with an average number of false positives per scan of 0.25 in negative patients and 0.56 in positive patients. At the same operating point, the sensitivity was 79.0% (95% CI: 70.4-86.6%) for the subset of tumors. A subgroup analysis showed that the system detected the majority of subtle tumors. The AI system detects most airway nodules on chest CT with an acceptable false positive rate. Question Incidental airway tumors are rare and are susceptible to being overlooked on chest CT. Findings An AI system can detect most benign and malignant airway nodules with an acceptable false positive rate, including nodules that have very subtle features. Clinical relevance An AI system shows potential for supporting radiologists in detecting airway tumors.",1927
40042649,Preliminary reports of lung cancer screening with low-dose computed tomography: a nationwide performance on the Korean population in 2019-2020.,European radiology,2025,"Korea introduced its National Lung Cancer Screening Program (NLCSP) with low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) in 2019. However, there are few published results of lung cancer screening at national level. We investigated the performance of LDCT for lung cancer screening and suggested recommendations for improving a nationwide population-based program. This study was a nationwide, population-based cross-sectional study. We analyzed the Korean National Health Insurance Big Data Base, which included lung cancer-related screening information between 2019 and 2020, was analyzed. Performance indicators were the number of examinations, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), overexposure, and suspected lung cancer (LCA). The performance indicators were stratified according to screening year, sex, age group, and region. A total of 149,936 examinations were done in 2019-2020. Most participants were men (98.3%) or were aged 54-59 or 60-64 (35.2% and 38.2%). The sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, overexposure, and suspected LCA were 82.9%, 91.9%, 6.4%, 99.9%, 2.7%, and 4.0%, respectively. Women showed lower sensitivity than men. In 2020, there was a substantial increase in PPV (11.0%), and a substantial decrease in overexposure (47.7%) and suspected LCA (16.9%) compared to 2019. At regional level, there was a large variance in sensitivity, PPV, overexposure, and suspected LCA. Korea's NLCSP successfully demonstrated validity and reliability at national level. Sexual, and regional differences should be addressed to improve NLCSP.

Findings The sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value were 82.9%, 91.9%, and 6.4%. Clinical relevance Korea's program demonstrated a similar level of validity and reliability of previous lung cancer screening studies at national level. It facilitated early diagnosis of lung cancer for all the relevant Korean population and laid the foundation for long-term cancer screening.",2148
40042648,Evaluating fusion models for predicting occult lymph node metastasis in tongue squamous cell carcinoma.,European radiology,2025,"This study evaluated and compared the effectiveness of various predictive models for forecasting occult lymph node metastasis (LNM) in tongue squamous cell carcinoma (TSCC) patients. In this retrospective diagnostic experiment, 268 patients were recruited from three medical centers. Based on the different hospitals from which the patients were recruited, they were divided into a training set, an internal testing set, and two external testing sets, comprising 107, 53, 63, and 45 patients, respectively. Several predictive models were developed using patients' contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (CEMRI), including two-dimensional deep learning (2D DL), conventional radiomics (C-radiomics), and intratumoral heterogeneity radiomics (ITH-radiomics). Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted on the clinical data. Finally, two fusion strategies were used to construct the model. The ITH-radiomics model exhibited superior discriminative power compared to C-radiomics model. The late fusion model had the highest area under the curve (AUC) across all test sets (0.81-0.85). Compared to the late fusion model, the AUC values for the early fusion, 2D DL, C-radiomics, and ITH-radiomics models in the test sets ranged from 0.77 to 0.82, 0.64 to 0.81, 0.66 to 0.77, and 0.77 to 0.80, respectively. Additionally, the late fusion model demonstrated the highest accuracy (76-89%) and specificity (87-100%) across the test sets. The evaluation of the models' effectiveness revealed that the decision-based late fusion model, which integrated 2D DL, C-radiomics, ITH-radiomics, and clinical data, achieved the best results. This predictive approach can more accurately assess patients' conditions and aid in selecting surgical plans. Question How well does fusing multiple models work for predicting occult lymph node metastasis in patients with tongue squamous cell carcinoma? Findings The late fusion model, incorporating two-dimensional deep learning, conventional-radiomics, intratumoral heterogeneity-radiomics, and clinical features, achieved the best results compared to each individual model. Clinical relevance Patients with a high intratumoral heterogeneity-radiomics index exhibit an increased risk of occult lymph node metastasis in tongue squamous cell carcinoma patients, which showed that the late fusion model achieves superior predictive performance compared to the early fusion model.",2435

Evidence is lacking to support AI performance when compared to gold-standard lung cancer outcomes. This study validated the performance of a commercially available AI software in the UK lung cancer screening (UKLS) trial dataset, with comparison to human reads and histological lung cancer outcomes, and estimated CT-reading workload reduction. 1252 UKLS-baseline-CT-scans were evaluated independently by AI and human readers. AI performance was evaluated on two-levels. Firstly, AI classification and individual reads were compared to a EU reference standard (based on NELSON2.0-European Position Statement) determined by a European expert panel blinded from individual results. A positive misclassification was defined as a nodule positive read ≥ 100mm Expert panel reference standard reported 815 (65 %) negative and 437 (35 %) indeterminate/positive CT-scans in the dataset of 1252 UKLS-participants. Compared to the reference standard, AI resulted in less misclassification than human reads, NPV 92·0 %(90·2 %-95·3 %). On comparison to gold-standard, AI detected all 31 baseline-round lung cancers, but classified one as negative due to the 100mm Implementing AI as first-reader to rule-out negative CT-scans, shows considerable potential to reduce CT-reading workload and does not lead to missed lung cancers.",1490

We compared a new AI solution, validated on a separate dataset from different UK hospitals, to the original multidisciplinary team (MDT)-supported radiologist's interpretations. A Conformité Européenne (CE)-marked deep-learning (DL) computer-aided detection (CAD) medical device (Pi) was trained to detect Gleason Grade Group (GG) ≥ 2 cancer using retrospective data from the PROSTATEx dataset and five UK hospitals (793 patients). Our separate validation dataset was on six machines from two manufacturers across six sites (252 patients). Data included in the study were from MRI scans performed between August 2018 to October 2022. Patients with a negative MRI who did not undergo biopsy were assumed to be negative (90.4% had prostate-specific antigen density < 0.15 ng/mL GG ≥ 2 prevalence in the validation set was 31%. Evaluated per patient, Pi was non-inferior to radiologists (considering a 10% performance difference as acceptable), with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.91 vs. 0.95. At the predetermined risk threshold of 3.5, the AI software's sensitivity was 95% and specificity 67%, while radiologists at Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data Systems/Likert ≥ 3 identified GG ≥ 2 with a sensitivity of 99% and specificity of 73%. AI performed well per-site (AUC ≥ 0.83) at the patient-level independent of scanner age and field strength. Real-world data testing suggests that Pi matches the performance of MDT-supported radiologists in GG ≥ 2 PCa detection and generalises to multiple sites, scanner vendors, and models. QuestionThe performance of artificial intelligence-based medical tools for prostate MRI has yet to be evaluated on multi-centre, multi-vendor data to assess generalisability. FindingsA dedicated AI medical tool matches the performance of multidisciplinary team-supported radiologists in prostate cancer detection and generalises to multiple sites and scanners.

The prospective MIPA observational study database was queried for patients aged 18-80 with newly diagnosed unilateral ILC at needle biopsy referred for primary surgery. Patients who underwent preoperative MRI (MRI group) were matched (1:1) with those who did not (noMRI group) according to nine confounding covariates. Surgical outcomes were compared between the matched groups with nonparametric statistics after calculating odds ratios (ORs). A total of 547 women with unilateral needle biopsy-diagnosed ILC were identified (158 noMRI group, 389 MRI group). After patient matching, each group retained 103 patients, for a total of 206 matched patients. For the rate of women having a first-line mastectomy, there was no significant difference between the MRI group (21.4%, 22/103; p = 0.727; OR 1.20, 95% CI: 0.61-2.38) and the noMRI group (18.4%, 19/103). Conversely, the reoperation rate in the MRI group (1.9%, 2/103) was significantly lower (p = 0.007; OR of avoiding reoperation 7.29, 95% CI: 1.60-33.21) than in the noMRI group (12.6%, 13/103 patients). Overall mastectomy rates (first plus second-line) did not significantly differ between the MRI group (23.3%, 24/103; p = 0.867, OR 1.12, 95% CI: 0.58-2.16) and the noMRI group (21.4%, 22/103). Women who had preoperative MRI after a needle biopsy diagnosis of ILC had a significant six-fold reduction in reoperations compared to those who did not have an MRI examination, with similar overall mastectomy rates. Question No randomized controlled trials investigating the impact of preoperative MRI on surgical outcomes (mastectomy rates and reoperation) of needle-biopsy-diagnosed ILC have been conducted. Findings In a patient-matched analysis of 103 vs 103 women, preoperative MRI led to a greater than six-fold reduction of reoperations, without significant differences in first-line and overall mastectomy rates. Clinical relevance In the absence of randomized controlled trials, patient matching can be applied to mitigate confounding factors that drive the referral to preoperative MRI, showing that preoperative MRI has beneficial effects on surgical outcomes in patients with needle biopsy-diagnosed unilateral ILC.",2347
40016316,How useful is contrast-enhanced MRI in the long-term surveillance of glioma? A multicentre retrospective longitudinal cohort study.,European radiology,2025,"To examine whether MRI with routine gadolinium-based contrast agent (GBCA) administration in the long-term surveillance of adult-type diffuse glioma identifies tumour progression earlier than T2-weighted (T2w) and/or T2w fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) MRI only. In this longitudinal retrospective multicentre cohort study patients with histopathologically confirmed adult-type diffuse glioma and at least two years survival after diagnosis in 2009-2010 were included. Progression was determined by the treating physician or during the multidisciplinary team meeting and defined as the moment a change in treatment or follow-up was required. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients that showed an increase of abnormalities on both contrast-enhanced T1-weighted (CET1w) and T2w/T2w-FLAIR at the time of progression. Chi-square testing was performed to analyse the relationship between the detection of progression on both scan sequences, with calculating the Phi coefficient to determine the degree of association. One hundred eight consecutive patients were included (58 male; 53 grade 2, 21 grade 3, 34 grade 4). Progression was present in 82 patients and was determined on both CET1w and T2w/T2w-FLAIR images in 59 patients (72.0%). In 20 patients (24.4%), progression was determined based solely on T2w/T2w-FLAIR abnormalities. Only three patients showed progression exclusively on CET1w (3.7%). There was a strong positive significant relationship between the detection of progression on both scan types (p < 0.001; Phi = 0.467). An increase in CET1w abnormalities was generally accompanied by an increase in T2w/T2w-FLAIR abnormalities, raising the question of whether routine administration of GBCA is always necessary for long-term survivors of glioma. Question Long-term survivors with glioma undergo many contrast-enhanced MRI scans, which involve a patient, financial, and environmental burden. Findings In almost all patients, an increase in T2w/T2w-FLAIR abnormalities was present at the time of tumour progression, mostly but not always accompanying contrast-enhancing findings. Clinical relevance T2w/T2-FLAIR MRI seems to detect glioma progression in long-term surviving patients similar to contrast-enhanced T1w MRI, raising the question of whether the routine administration of GBCA is necessary and justified in patients under long-term surveillance of glioma.",2401
40009088,The Avocado Sign: A novel imaging marker for nodal staging in rectal cancer.,European radiology,2025,"To evaluate the diagnostic performance of the Avocado Sign, a novel contrast-enhancement-based MR imaging marker, for prognostication of mesorectal lymph node spread in rectal cancer. This retrospective study included 106 patients with rectal cancer who underwent MRI examination. The Avocado Sign, defined as a hypointense core within an otherwise homogeneously hyperintense lymph node on contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images, was assessed. Of the cohort, 77 patients received neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy followed by restaging MRI. Histopathological examination served as the reference standard. Diagnostic metrics were calculated and compared between subgroups using chi-square tests. Interobserver agreement was evaluated using Cohen's kappa. The Avocado Sign demonstrated high diagnostic accuracy for predicting lymph node involvement, with an overall sensitivity of 88.7%, specificity of 84.9%, PPV of 85.5%, NPV of 88.2%, and accuracy of 86.8%. The area under the ROC curve was 0.87. Subgroup analysis revealed excellent performance in both patients undergoing surgery alone (sensitivity 100%, specificity 83.3%) and those receiving neoadjuvant therapy (sensitivity 84.2%, specificity 85.4%). Interobserver agreement was almost perfect (κ = 0.92). The Avocado Sign is a promising imaging predictor for mesorectal lymph node status in rectal cancer. Its straightforward application, high reproducibility, and remarkable diagnostic accuracy underline its potential to refine MRI staging. However, further validation in larger, prospective multicenter studies is warranted to confirm these findings and assess their impact on clinical decision-making. Question Can the Avocado Sign on contrast-enhanced MRI improve mesorectal lymph node staging in rectal cancer independently of classical morphological criteria? Findings The Avocado Sign demonstrated high sensitivity (88.7%) and specificity (84.9%) as a standalone marker for predicting mesorectal lymph node involvement. Clinical relevance Incorporating contrast-enhanced sequences and the Avocado Sign into MRI protocols enhances nodal staging accuracy in rectal cancer, potentially informing treatment decisions. Further validation is required to confirm its effectiveness and compare it with existing criteria.",2271

Current representative use cases for AI in thoracic imaging show cumulative evidence of effectiveness. These include AI assistance for reading chest radiographs and low-dose (1.5-mSv) chest CT scans for lung cancer screening and triaging pulmonary embolism on chest CT scans. Other potential use cases are also under investigation, including filtering out normal chest radiographs, monitoring reading errors, and automated opportunistic screening of nontarget diseases. However, implementing AI tools in daily practice requires establishing practical strategies. Practical AI implementation will require objective on-site performance evaluation, institutional information technology infrastructure integration, and postdeployment monitoring. Meanwhile, the remaining challenges of adopting AI technology need to be addressed. These challenges include educating radiologists and radiology trainees, alleviating liability risk, and addressing potential disparities due to the uneven distribution of data and AI technology. Finally, next-generation AI technology represented by large language models (LLMs), including multimodal models, which can interpret both text and images, is expected to innovate the current landscape of AI in thoracic radiology practice. These LLMs offer opportunities ranging from generating text reports from images to explaining examination results to patients.

39980388,Body composition and checkpoint inhibitor treatment outcomes in advanced melanoma: a multicenter cohort study.,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,2025,"The association of body composition with checkpoint inhibitor outcomes in melanoma is a matter of ongoing debate. In this study, we aim to investigate body mass index (BMI) alongside computed tomography (CT)-derived body composition metrics in the largest cohort to date. Patients treated with first-line anti-PD1 ± anti-CTLA4 for advanced melanoma were retrospectively identified from 11 melanoma centers in The Netherlands. From baseline CT scans, 5 body composition metrics were extracted: subcutaneous adipose tissue index, visceral adipose tissue index, skeletal muscle index, density, and gauge. These metrics were correlated in univariable and multivariable Cox proportional hazards analysis with progression-free survival, overall survival, and melanoma-specific survival (PFS, OS, and MSS). A total of 1471 eligible patients were included. Median PFS and OS were 9.1 and 38.1 months, respectively. Worse PFS was observed in underweight patients (multivariable hazard ratio [HR] = 1.86, 95% CI = 1.14 to 3.06). Furthermore, prolonged OS was observed in patients with higher skeletal muscle density (multivariable HR = 0.88, 95% CI = 0.81 to 0.97) and gauge (multivariable HR = 0.61, 95% CI = 0.82 to 0.998), whereas higher visceral adipose tissue index was associated with worse OS (multivariable HR = 1.12, 95% CI = 1.04 to 1.22). No association with survival outcomes was found for overweight, obesity, or subcutaneous adipose tissue. Our findings suggest that underweight BMI is associated with worse PFS, whereas higher skeletal muscle density and lower visceral adipose tissue index were associated with improved OS. These associations were independent of known prognostic factors, including sex, age, performance status, and extent of disease. No significant association between higher BMI and survival outcomes was observed.",1839
39979621,Node-RADS category on preoperative CT predicts prognosis in patients with papillary renal cell carcinoma.,European radiology,2025,"This research focused on investigating the relationship between the Node Reporting and Data System (Node-RADS) categories, determined via preoperative CT, and the outcomes of progression-free survival (PFS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS) in individuals diagnosed with papillary renal cell carcinoma (pRCC). A retrospective multicenter study initially enrolled 454 patients, with 218 eligible for analysis following partial nephrectomy or radical resection for pRCC. Prognostic factors related to PFS and CSS in pRCC patients were identified through univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses. Subsequently, the prognostic value of Node-RADS was assessed and compared with the existing pRCC risk stratification model. In total, 218 patients (mean age, 58 years; men, 164 [75.2%]) with pRCC (186 Node-rads I tumors (85.3%), 10 Node-rads II tumors (4.6%), and 22 Node-rads III tumors (10.1%)) were included. The Node-RADS category emerged as an independent prognostic factor for PFS (III vs II vs I, hazard ratio (HR) 4.250, p < 0.001) and CSS (III vs II vs I, HR 4.466; p < 0.001). When the Node-RADS category was incorporated into Leibovich's model, the resulting combined model demonstrated a significant improvement in predictive accuracy (C-index: 0.865 versus 0.755, p = 0.005 for PFS; and 0.921 versus 0.835, p = 0.01 for CSS). The Node-RADS category has been identified as a more accurate predictor of prognosis for pRCC, regardless of pathologic lymph node involvement. These findings need further confirmation in prospective studies. Question Lymph node status is important for papillary renal cell carcinoma prognosis, and there is a lack of consensus on radiological evaluation. Findings Node-RADS is an independent predictor of progression-free survival and cancer-specific survival in papillary renal cell carcinoma. Clinical relevance The Node Reporting and Data System category improves the accuracy of the Leibovich model for prognosis, which can help clinical practitioners select individualized treatment plans for each patient.",2057
39971792,Important radiological and clinicopathological risk factors for the recurrence of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms after surgical resection.,European radiology,2025,"To assess significant radiological and clinicopathological risk factors for post-surgery recurrence in patients with intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN). Patients with IPMNs who underwent surgery from 2011 to 2021 at a single center were retrospectively included. Two reviewers evaluated CT findings according to international guidelines. Clinicopathological data were collected from medical records and surgical pathology reports. Patients were monitored for recurrence with contrast-enhanced CT or MRI up to 2023. Univariable Cox regression analysis included potential risk factors: all high-risk stigmata and worrisome features in the international guidelines, age, sex, tumor location, type, carcinoembryonic antigen, surgery type, postsurgical residual cyst, adjuvant treatment, pathologic grade, type, size, margin status, lymph node metastasis, gland type, and pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia. Variables with p < 0.2 were included in multivariate analysis. Among 332 patients (mean age, 66.3 ± 9.0 years; 212 men), recurrence occurred in 39 (11.7%) over a median follow-up of 3.2 years (range: 0.1-12.3 years). Two- and five-year recurrence-free survival rates were 91.2% and 86.4%, respectively. Significant radiological risk factors included enhancing mural nodule (EMN) presence (hazard ratio [HR] 5.088, p = 0.007) and lymphadenopathy (HR 2.837, p = 0.01). Associated invasive carcinoma (HR 25.030), lymph node metastasis (HR 27.562), adjuvant treatment (HR 0.203), and history of pancreatitis (HR 2.608) were also significant. Most imaging features showed moderate to excellent interobserver agreement, except for thickened/enhancing cyst walls (κ, 0.25). The presence of EMNs and lymphadenopathy, along with several clinicopathologic factors, were significantly associated with IPMN recurrence. Question Understanding postoperative recurrence risk in IPMN patients is crucial for determining surveillance strategies; however, research on radiologic risk factors remains limited. Findings The presence of EMNs and lymphadenopathy were identified as significant radiologic risk factors for the postoperative recurrence of IPMN, along with clinicopathologic factors. Clinical relevance IPMN recurrence is significantly associated with imaging findings like EMNs and lymphadenopathy, as well as clinical and pathologic factors. It can guide the development of tailored postoperative surveillance strategies for IPMN patients in further studies.",2469
39969143,"MRI in Prostate Cancer Screening: A Review and Recommendations, From the ",AJR. American journal of roentgenology,2025,"Traditional PSA-based screening for prostate cancer (PCa) is challenged by an unfavorable benefit-to-harm ratio from underdiagnosis of clinically significant cancers, overdiagnosis of indolent cancers, and unnecessary biopsies, despite demonstrated reductions in PCa-associated mortality. Inclusion of MRI in screening algorithms helps address these limitations by improving risk stratification of men suspected of having PCa and by enabling targeted biopsies. The impact of MRI-based strategies on screening's benefit-to-harm ratio can be objectively assessed using ratios reflecting clinically significant cancers detected, indolent cancers detected, unproductive biopsies, and avoided biopsies. Of two overarching MRI-based screening strategies (sequential MRI after PSA testing and MRI alone), the sequential strategy is favored as a balanced and scalable approach. This Special Series Review provides a detailed analysis of the role of MRI in PCa screening, targeted to radiologists. Recommendations are provided for optimizing the use of MRI in PCa screening, including individualized risk assessments, tailored protocols, quality assurance for ensuring reliable and reproducible results, and consideration of new screening-specific scoring systems and biopsy thresholds. Ultimately, successful integration of MRI in PCa screening will require radiologists to actively engage in refining protocols, standardizing interpretations, and adopting emerging technologies. Such efforts will help maximize benefits while minimizing harms, enabling wider acceptance of PCa screening.",1580

A total of 734 IDH-wildtype glioblastoma patients were enrolled between 2005 and 2022. LM at recurrence was diagnosed with MRI including postcontrast FLAIR. Logistic analysis for development of LM at recurrence was performed with clinical, molecular, imaging (including tumor volume and distance to subventricular zone via automatic segmentation), and surgical data including extent of resection and ventricular entry. The overall survival (OS) was compared between patients with and without LM at recurrence. The incidence of LM at recurrence based on postcontrast FLAIR was 10.8% (79 patients). On multivariable analysis, younger age at diagnosis (odds ratio (OR) = 0.98, p = 0.011) and ventricular entry (OR = 3.15, p < 0.001) were independent predictors of LM at recurrence. However, patients with LM at recurrence showed no significant difference in OS from patients without LM (log-rank test; p = 0.461), with median OS of 18.0 (95% confidence interval (CI) 16.2-19.8) and 18.5 (95% CI 16.4-20.7) months in patients with and without LM at recurrence, respectively. The incidence of LM at recurrence is relatively high in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma patients. Younger age and ventricular entry during surgery warrant imaging surveillance for LM at recurrence. As LM at recurrence showed no significant OS compromise and larger extent of resection (EOR) is associated with survival benefits, ventricular entry during maximal safe resection may be acceptable. Question The incidence, risk factors, and prognosis of leptomeningeal metastases (LM) diagnosed at recurrence in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma patients are currently unknown. Findings LM at recurrence occurred in 10.8% of cases, with younger age and ventricular entry as risk factors, but no significant difference in survival outcomes between groups. Clinical relevance The incidence, risk factors, and prognosis of LM at recurrence were investigated in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma patients with postcontrast FLAIR.

Two hundred and nineteen patients with histologically proven HCCs (high/low Ki67 PI, N = 134/85; +/-CK19, N = 47/172) who underwent preoperative MRI and MRE examinations were retrospectively enrolled. Imaging features and clinical information were analyzed to develop the clinical-radiologic models. Logistic regression and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) analyses were used to evaluate the status of Ki67 PI and CK19, and their model performances. Tumor stiffness (TS) (p = 0.004) and TS/liver stiffness (LS) (p < 0.001) were significantly independent predictors of high Ki67 PI and positive CK19, respectively. By incorporating TS or TS/LS value, the AUCs of the clinical-radiological models have been improved for identifying high Ki67 PI from 0.796 to 0.819 (p = 0.113), and positive CK19 from 0.817 to 0.852 (p = 0.026). Patients with predicted high Ki67 PI/positive CK19 based on the combined models had worse recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) than those with low Ki67 PI/negative CK19 (all p < 0.05), respectively. The combined statuses of predicted Ki67 PI and CK19 stratified patients into three distinct subgroups with significantly different RFS and OS (all p < 0.05). Notably, patients with predicted high Ki67 PI and positive CK19 had the worst prognosis. Three-dimensional MRE could be a promising tool for evaluating and stratifying the prognosis of HCC patients by predicting the status of Ki67 PI and CK19 preoperatively. Question Can MRE-based stiffness predict Ki67 PI and Cytokeratin 19 (CK19) in HCC? Findings MRE-based stiffness is an independent predictor of high Ki67 PI and CK19-positive and improves the diagnostic performance of clinical-radiological models predicting Ki67 PI and CK19 status. Clinical relevance MRE-based stiffness is a noninvasive predictor of high Ki67 PI and CK19-positive, and in combination with clinical-radiological models can be used for prognostic analysis, which could refine patients' selection for adjuvant therapy or surveillance.",2257

Differences in on-site availability and receipt of these diagnostic services may contribute to disparities in breast cancer outcomes across sociodemographic groups. Purpose To identify multilevel factors associated with on-site availability and receipt of diagnostic imaging and biopsy after screening mammography. Materials and Methods This retrospective study included female patients (age range, 40-89 years) who underwent screening mammography at 136 facilities in the United States from January 2010 to December 2020. The primary exposure variables were race and ethnicity and neighborhood-level educational attainment, household income, and rurality. The adjustment variables were age, breast density, breast biopsy history, personal and family history of breast cancer, time from prior mammographic examination to screening mammography, screening modality, facility academic affiliation, and screening examination year. The relative risk (RR) of factors for on-site availability at screening facilities and undergoing standard-of-care imaging (ie, mammography and/or US) and advanced diagnostic imaging (ie, digital breast tomosynthesis, MRI) and biopsy, and undergoing any same-day diagnostic service and biopsy were estimated using modified Poisson regression. Results In total, 1 123 177 female patients (median age, 59 years; IQR, 51-67 years) underwent 3 519 502 screening mammographic examinations: 10.3% Asian patients (362 440 of 3 519 502), 12.7% Black patients (447 777 of 3 519 502), 6.5% Hispanic patients (227 177 of 3 519 502), 68.3% White patients (2 403 159 of 3 519 502), and 2.2% all other races and ethnicities (78 949 of 3 519 502). In most fully adjusted models, race or ethnicity and neighborhood-level socioeconomic status were not associated with on-site diagnostic service availability. However, compared with White patients, patients belonging to racial and ethnic minority groups were less likely to undergo same-day diagnostic services after abnormal screening mammography (Asian patients: RR, 0.74 [95% CI: 0.64, 0.85]; Black patients: RR, 0.56 [95% CI: 0.49, 0.63]; Hispanic patients: RR, 0.61 [95% CI: 0.52, 0.71]). Black patients were less likely to undergo same-day biopsies after an abnormal diagnostic workup (RR, 0.46; 95% CI: 0.33, 0.65). Conclusion Although no evidence existed that on-site diagnostic service availability varied by race and ethnicity in most models, patients in racial and ethnic minority groups were less likely to be provided same-day diagnostic services and Black patients were less likely to undergo same-day biopsy. © RSNA, 2025 ",2691

39964263,Association of Epicardial Adipose Tissue Changes on Serial Chest CT Scans with Mortality: Insights from the National Lung Screening Trial.,Radiology,2025,"Background Individuals eligible for lung cancer screening with low-dose CT face a higher cardiovascular mortality risk. Purpose To investigate the association between changes in epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) at the 2-year interval and mortality in individuals undergoing serial low-dose CT lung cancer screening. Materials and Methods This secondary analysis of the National Lung Screening Trial obtained EAT volume and density from serial low-dose CT scans using a validated automated deep learning algorithm. EAT volume and density changes over 2 years were categorized into typical (decrease of 7% to increase of 11% and decrease of 3% to increase of 2%, respectively) and atypical (increase or decrease beyond typical) changes, which were associated with all-cause, cardiovascular, and lung cancer mortality. Uni- and multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression models-adjusted for baseline EAT values, age, sex, race, ethnicity, smoking, pack-years, heart disease or myocardial infarction, stroke, hypertension, diabetes, education status, body mass index, and coronary artery calcium-were performed. Results Among 20 661 participants (mean age, 61.4 years ± 5.0 [SD]; 12 237 male [59.2%]), 3483 (16.9%) died over a median follow-up of 10.4 years (IQR, 9.9-10.8 years) (cardiovascular related: 816 [23.4%]; lung cancer related: 705 [20.2%]).

39961863,Multimodal deep learning: tumor and visceral fat impact on colorectal cancer occult peritoneal metastasis.,European radiology,2025,"This study proposes a multimodal deep learning (DL) approach to investigate the impact of tumors and visceral fat on occult peritoneal metastasis in colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. We developed a DL model named Multi-scale Feature Fusion Network (MSFF-Net) based on ResNet18, which extracted features of tumors and visceral fat from the longest diameter tumor section and the third lumbar vertebra level (L3) in preoperative CT scans of CRC patients. Logistic regression analysis was applied to patients' clinical data that integrated with DL features. A random forest (RF) classifier was established to evaluate the MSFF-Net's performance on internal and external test sets and compare it with radiologists' performance. The model incorporating fat features outperformed the single tumor modality in the internal test set. Combining clinical information with DL provided the best diagnostic performance for predicting peritoneal metastasis in CRC patients. The AUCs were 0.941 (95% CI: [0.891, 0.986], p = 0.03) for the internal test set and 0.911 (95% CI: [0.857, 0.971], p = 0.013) for the external test set. CRC patients with peritoneal metastasis had a higher visceral adipose tissue index (VATI) compared to those without. Maximum tumor diameter and VATI were identified as independent prognostic factors for peritoneal metastasis. Grad-CAM decision regions corresponded with the independent prognostic factors identified by logistic regression analysis. The study confirms the network features of tumors and visceral fat significantly enhance predictive performance for peritoneal metastasis in CRC. Visceral fat is a meaningful imaging biomarker for peritoneal metastasis's early detection in CRC patients. Question Current research on predicting colorectal cancer with peritoneal metastasis mainly focuses on single-modality analysis, while studies based on multimodal imaging information are relatively scarce. Findings The Multi-scale Feature Fusion Network, constructed based on ResNet18, can utilize CT images of tumors and visceral fat to detect occult peritoneal metastasis in colorectal cancer. Clinical relevance This study identified independent prognostic factors for colorectal cancer peritoneal metastasis and combines them with tumor and visceral fat network features, aiding early diagnosis and accurate prognostic assessment.",2351
39953153,Predicting progression-free survival using dynamic contrast-enhanced imaging-based radiomics in advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients treated with nimotuzumab.,European radiology,2025,"The purpose of this study was to explore the potential value of the radiomics model based on dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI), compared with the clinical model mostly based on the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression, in predicting progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma (LA-NPC) treated with nimotuzumab (NTZ). A total of 136 patients with LA-NPC who received NTZ treatment between January 2018 and June 2022 were included in this study. Patients were randomly divided into training (n = 95) and validation (n = 41) groups in a 7:3 ratio. DCE-MRI radiomics, clinical, and clinical-radiomics models were built to predict PFS. The relationship between EGFR expression levels and NTZ efficacy was assessed using Kaplan-Meier curves. Model performance was assessed using the area under the curve, calibration, and DeLong tests. Decision curve analysis evaluated net clinical benefit. Patients were stratified into high- and low-risk groups based on optimal model radiomic scores, and prognoses were compared using Kaplan-Meier curves. Univariate Cox regression analysis demonstrated that EGFR expression level was the only independent predictive factor of PFS (p < 0.05). Patients with EGFR 3+ receiving NTZ therapy had significantly longer PFS than those with EGFR 1+ (hazard ratio = 3.025, p < 0.05). The clinical-radiomics model exhibited superior predictive efficacy, compared with the radiomics and clinical models (training set: 0.887 vs. 0.845, 0.654; validation set: 0.831, 0.824 vs. 0.567, all p < 0.001). The clinical-radiomics models using DCE-MRI and EGFR levels can effectively predict NTZ efficacy in LA-NPC patients, providing objective evidence for personalized treatment adjustments. Question How can the response to nimotuzumab treatment in patients with locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma be accurately predicted using non-invasive imaging methods? Findings A combined clinical and radiomic model using dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging showed improved predictive performance for progression-free survival in patients treated with nimotuzumab. Clinical relevance The study provides evidence for using a combined clinical and radiomic approach, offering a non-invasive method to predict treatment response and guide personalized treatment strategies for patients with locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma, potentially improving patient outcomes.",2487
39953152,CT-based detection of clinically significant portal hypertension predicts post-hepatectomy outcomes in hepatocellular carcinoma.,European radiology,2025,"While the CT-based method of detecting clinically significant portal hypertension (CSPH) emerged as a noninvasive alternative for evaluating CSPH, its predictive ability for post-hepatectomy outcomes is unknown. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the impact of CT-based CSPH on outcomes following hepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This retrospective single-center study included patients with advanced chronic liver disease (ACLD) who underwent hepatectomy for very early or early-stage HCC between January 2017 and December 2018. CSPH was assessed using CT-based criteria, which included splenomegaly determined by deep learning-based spleen volume measurements with personalized reference thresholds, and the presence of gastroesophageal varices (GEV), spontaneous portosystemic shunt or ascites. Logistic regression and competing risk analyses were used to identify factors associated with severe post-hepatectomy liver failure (PHLF), hepatic decompensation, and liver-related death or transplantation. The predictive performance of existing models for PHLF was compared using both CT-based and conventional CSPH criteria (endoscopic GEV or splenomegaly with thrombocytopenia). Among 593 patients (460 men; mean age 57.9 ± 9.3 years), 41 (6.9%) developed severe PHLF. The median follow-up period was 62 months. CT-based CSPH independently predicted severe PHLF (OR 7.672 [95% CI 3.209-18.346]), hepatic decompensation (subdistribution hazard ratio (sHR) 4.518 [1.868-10.929]), and liver-related death or transplantation (sHR 2.756 [1.315-5.773]). When integrated into existing models, CT-based CSPH outperformed conventional CSPH in predicting severe PHLF (AUC 0.724 vs. 0.694 for EASL algorithm (p = 0.036) and 0.854 vs. 0.830 for Wang's model (p = 0.011)). CT-based CSPH is a strong predictor of poor post-hepatectomy outcomes in HCC patients with ACLD, offering a noninvasive surgical risk assessment tool. Question Can CT-based detection of clinically significant portal hypertension (CSPH) serve as a noninvasive predictor of post-hepatectomy outcomes in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients? Findings CT-based CSPH independently predicted severe post-hepatectomy liver failure, hepatic decompensation, and liver-related death or transplantation, outperforming conventional CSPH criteria in predictive performance. Clinical relevance CT-based CSPH offers a noninvasive and effective tool for surgical risk assessment in HCC patients, potentially improving the selection of candidates for hepatectomy and optimizing patient outcomes.",2563
39953151,CT radiomics-based intratumoral and intertumoral heterogeneity indicators for prognosis prediction in gastric cancer patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy.,European radiology,2025,"CT-based intratumoral and intertumoral heterogeneity indicators were integrated to develop a prognostic model for locally advanced gastric cancer (LAGC) patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT). This retrospective study included 568 LAGC patients treated with NACT from two hospitals. The intratumor heterogeneity score (ITHscore) was developed to quantify the intratumoral heterogeneity of LAGCs on CT; intertumoral heterogeneity was characterized by combining the primary tumor (PT) and lymph node (LN) sizes on CT. CT indicators were measured on baseline and posttreatment CT scans; the reduction rates (%Δ) were calculated. The overall survival (OS) of all patients was recorded. Cox regression analysis was used to construct a preoperative survival prediction model (Pre-SPM) based on the baseline indicators and %Δ indicators. The predictive performance of Pre-SPM for OS was assessed. The clinicopathological data, including the ypTNM stage, were also collected to evaluate their impact on OS. Patients with lower baseline ITHscore had better prognoses (p < 0.001). Approximately 13.01% of patients exhibited contradictory changes in PT and LN sizes. Cox regression analysis selected the baseline ITHscore, baseline PT area, %ΔPT, and %ΔLN to establish the Pre-SPM. In the external validation cohort, the c-index of Pre-SPM for predicting OS was 0.72, while the AUC for predicting 5-year OS was 0.73. After adjusting for the influence of clinicopathological features, including the ypTNM stage, Pre-SPM remained an independent prognostic factor. The Pre-SPM model, combining intratumoral heterogeneity and intertumoral heterogeneity, has the potential to predict the OS of LAGC patients receiving NACT. Question Increased tumor heterogeneity in LAGC affects prognosis, but effective non-invasive CT methods for assessing intratumoral and intertumoral heterogeneity are lacking. Findings ITHscore indicates intratumoral heterogeneity, while changes in PT and LN sizes reflect intertumoral heterogeneity. The Pre-SPM model, integrating both, independently predicts patient outcomes. Clinical relevance Pre-SPM enhances prognosis prediction by quantifying intratumoral and intertumoral heterogeneity, potentially guiding more personalized and effective treatment strategies for patients with LAGC.",2312
39953148,"Atypical pulmonary cysts in lung cancer screening: prevalence, outcomes, and clinical implications.",European radiology,2025,"We aimed to examine the prevalence and clinical outcomes of atypical pulmonary cysts (APCs) in lung cancer screening (LCS) and evaluate the impact of APC introduction on Lung-RADS v2022 categorization. We reviewed 2968 low-dose baseline chest CT scans from LCS participants between June 2017 and April 2023. Two thoracic radiologists assessed the presence and type of APCs and evaluated interval changes. We also investigated how the introduction of APC changed Lung-RADS categories. Interobserver agreement was assessed using Cohen's kappa coefficient. Of the 2968 participants (2900 men, 68 women; median age: 61 years [IQR: 57-65]), 18 (0.6%) had APCs. The interobserver agreement for APC presence was fair (κ = 0.33; 95% CI: 0.07-0.44). Among the 16 APC cases with follow-up CTs (median follow-up: 22 months), lung cancer was confirmed in three cases (18.8%). Among the remaining 13 APCs, 4 (30.8%) showed growth, 7 (53.8%) showed no change and 2 (15.4%) exhibited decreased wall thickness. Histological confirmation was not obtained for these 13 cases, indicating a minimum cancer rate of 18.8%. The introduction of APC led to a positive result change in 0.4% of participants (12/2968), with two lung cancer cases among them. APCs were infrequent in LCS, with a 0.6% prevalence, but had a high cancer rate (18.8%). Although the introduction of APC led to a 0.4% increase in positive screenings, this is considered acceptable as it included two lung cancer cases, highlighting the importance of recognizing APCs for early lung cancer detection. Question What is the prevalence and clinical significance of APCs detected during LCS, and how do they impact diagnostic outcomes? Findings APCs were detected in 0.6% of participants, with a high cancer rate of at least 18.8%, and increased screening positive results by 0.4%. Clinical relevance APCs during LCS, although uncommon, are crucial because of their high risk of lung cancer. This enhances early detection of lung cancer and improves patient management strategies.",2024
39948211,Prediction of thyroid malignancy risk using clinical and ultrasonography features and a machine learning approach.,European radiology,2025,"This study aims to develop and validate a predictive model for thyroid nodule malignancy risks using clinical and ultrasonography features and a machine learning (ML) approach. This retrospective study is based on the clinical and ultrasound characteristics of 1035 thyroid nodules (845 benign and 190 malignant) to develop and validate the risk prediction model. Employing multiple logistic regression, key features were selected in developing the model. Eight ML algorithms were evaluated for predicting the risks of malignancy. Finally, the predictive ability of the best-performing algorithm was compared against American College of Radiology Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System (ACR TI-RADS) and American Thyroid Association (ATA) guidelines. Based on AUC criteria (88.3, 95% CI: 81.2-94.2), sensitivity (84.2, 95% CI: 71.1-94.7), specificity (92.3, 95% CI: 88.2-95.9), positive predictive value, (71.4, 95% CI: 60.4-83.3) and negative predictive value (96.3, 95% CI: 93.5-98.8), the XGBoost algorithm exhibited superior performance over the other ML algorithms and ACR TI-RADS and ATA. These criteria were obtained for ACR TI-RADS at 54.2%, 63.2%, 48.5%, 21.1%, and 84.8%, while for ATA, they were 44.3%, 76.3%, 27.2%, 18.4%, and 81.6%. In addition, the unnecessary fine-needle aspiration (FNA) rate with ACR TI-RADS and ATA was 43% and 63%, respectively-significantly higher than the 7% obtained with XGBoost. This study demonstrated the capability of ML approaches in enhancing the accuracy of predicting thyroid malignancy risks as well as their potential benefits in optimizing healthcare resources by reducing unnecessary FNA rates. Using the proposed model through a web-based tool can facilitate clinical judgments in thyroid nodule management and personalized treatment. Question Current risk assessment systems have limitations, with high unnecessary FNA rates compared to machine learning (ML) models. Findings The XGBoost algorithm was compared to other ML algorithms, ACR TI-RADS, and ATA and demonstrated superior performance. Clinical relevance This study demonstrated the capability of ML approaches in enhancing the accuracy of predicting thyroid malignancy.

39945595,Effective Treatment of Disseminated Prostate Cancer Using CD46-Targeted 225Ac Therapy.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,2025,"Metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer has limited treatment options and a poor prognosis. Recently, prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-targeted alpha-particle therapy agents using actinium-225 (225Ac) have shown promising results in prostate cancer treatment, but a significant fraction of patients with advanced mCRPC demonstrate loss of PSMA expression. We have previously reported that PSMA-null and PSMA-positive tumors can be detected and treated effectively with CD46-targeted radiopharmaceuticals. This study evaluates the CD46-targeting PET imaging agent [89Zr]DFO-YS5, and the radioimmunotherapy agent [225Ac]Macropa-PEG4-YS5, in disseminated prostate cancer tumors. Microtumor lesions, primarily observed in the liver, kidneys, and lungs, were successfully detected with [89Zr]DFO-YS5 PET imaging. We used disseminated 22Rv1 tumors for biodistribution studies, dosimetry assessments, and therapeutic efficacy evaluations of [225Ac]Macropa-PEG4-YS5. Quantitative digital alpha-particle autoradiography revealed high radiation dose deposition from [225Ac]Macropa-PEG4-YS5 in microtumors compared with surrounding liver tissues, although in larger lesions (>1 mm diameter), the dose distribution was heterogeneous. Early treatment of smaller disseminated tumors with a uniform radiation dose was more effective in ablating tumors and promoting survival. In late-stage lesions of large size, heterogeneous dose deposition limited therapeutic efficacy, requiring higher administered activity to achieve a complete response. Our findings highlight that [225Ac]Macropa-PEG4-YS5 holds the potential for clinical translation for metastatic prostate cancer and reinforces the value of microdosimetry in understanding the efficacy of and resistance to targeted alpha therapy.

39939426,MRI of pediatric ovarian masses: validation of the O-RADS framework.,European radiology,2025,"The purpose of our study was to test the applicability and implications of using the O-RADS system, which is developed and validated on adults, to review MRI of ovarian masses among pediatric patients. We retrospectively reviewed consecutive MRI examinations from pediatric patients referred to imaging for suspected ovarian lesions, assessing them using the O-RADS framework. Malignancy frequencies among O-RADS classes were reviewed, and we appraised the potential for such approach to split patients into low (O-RADS 1, 2, and 3) and high risk (O-RADS 4 and 5). Multivariate analyses were conducted to review which clinical or imaging variables yielded a significant impact on malignancy, and a simplified reading framework was proposed accordingly. 109 female patients were included, with a median age of 13 years (IQR 11-15 years), 7 (7%) presenting with malignant lesions. Malignancy proportions were 0% (95% confidence Interval (CI) 0-35%) for the O-RADS 1 class, 0% (95% CI 0 - 5%) for the O-RADS 2 class, 0% (95% CI 0-14%) for the O-RADS 3 class, 50 (95% CI 1 - 99%) for the O-RADS 4 class, and 75% (95% CI 41-93%) for the O-RADS 5 class. The presence of peritoneal thickening or nodules (p < 0.001), lesion composition (p < 0.001), and absence of intralesional fat (p = 0.051) were individual predictors of malignancy, and the simplified reading framework proposed with such variables identified 11 likely malignant cases, detecting all 7 malignant lesions. The O-RADS system may be applied to MRI performed in the pediatric population for ovarian masses, and a simplified reading framework based on O-RADS could also prove useful in such a setting. Question The Ovarian-Adnexal Reporting and Data System (O-RADS) provides the risk of malignancy of ovarian masses among adults but has not been validated among pediatric patients. Findings Malignancy frequencies for O-RADS classes 1, 2, 3, and 4 were 0, 0, 50%, and 75%, indicating a good accuracy in lesion discrimination. Clinical relevance The Ovarian-Adnexal Reporting and Data System (O-RADS) can be effectively applied to MRI examinations in pediatric patients, enabling accurate classification of findings, with potential for score simplification in this age group.",2232
39939425,A multicenter diagnostic study of thyroid nodule with Hashimoto's thyroiditis enabled by Hashimoto's thyroiditis nodule-artificial intelligence model.,European radiology,2025,"This study aimed to develop a Hashimoto's thyroiditis nodule-artificial intelligence (HTN-AI) model to optimize the diagnosis of thyroid nodules with Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT) of which the efficiency and accuracy remain challenging. This study included 5709 patients from 10 hospitals between January 2014 and March 2024. Among them, 5053 thyroid nodules were divided into training and testing sets in a 9:1 ratio. Then, we tested the model on an external dataset (n = 432). Finally, we prospectively recruited 224 patients with dynamic ultrasound videos acquired and employed the HTN-AI model to identify nodules from the dynamic ultrasound videos. Radiologists of varying seniority performed the categorization of thyroid nodules as benign and malignant, both with and without the assistance of the HTN-AI model, and their diagnostic performances were compared. The results indicated that for the external testing set, the HTN-AI model achieved a Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 0.91, outperforming several other common convolutional neural network (CNN) models. Specifically, the DSCs of the HTN-AI model were similar for thyroid nodule patients with and without HT which were 0.91 ± 0.06 and 0.91 ± 0.09. Moreover, when the HTN-AI model was used to assist diagnosis, it demonstrated an improvement in the diagnostic performance of radiologists. The diagnostic areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUCs) of the junior radiologists increased from 0.59, 0.59, and 0.57 to 0.68, 0.65, and 0.65. This research demonstrates that the HTN-AI model has excellent performance in identifying thyroid nodules associated with HT and can assist radiologists with more accurate and efficient diagnoses of thyroid nodules. Question The study developed an HTN-AI model aimed at assisting in the diagnosis of thyroid nodules in patients with HT. Findings The HTN-AI model achieved great performance with a Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 0.91, and consistent performance across patients with and without HT. Clinical relevance The HTN-AI model enhances the accuracy and efficiency of thyroid nodule diagnosis, particularly in patients with HT. By assisting radiologists at varying experience levels, this model supports improved decision-making in the management of thyroid nodules.",2301
39939422,Deciphering the intratumoral histologic heterogeneity of lung adenocarcinoma using radiomics.,European radiology,2025,"To discern highly aggressive intratumoral areas among lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and its impact on occult nodal metastases and the recurrence rate with radiomic analysis. This prospective dual-institution study analyzed clinical information and high-resolution preoperative CT of 528 patients from institution A and 249 patients from institution B. We extracted radiomic features and performed pathologic evaluations for resected tumors, based on the 2020 International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC) classification. Prediction models were developed to discern micropapillary and solid patterns within LUAD using clinical and radiomic features from institution A through logistic analysis. Six selected CT radiomic features, sex, CTR (consolidation-to-tumor ratio), and solid diameter were selected to develop the prediction models. A composite model of radiomic and clinical characteristics outperformed radiomics-only and clinical-only models (AUC, 95% CI; the composite model: 0.84 [0.81-0.87]; the radiomics model: 0.82 [0.78-0.87]; the clinical model: 0.80 [0.76-0.83]) in institution A. External validation was performed with institution B cohort, showing even better results (AUC, 95% CI; the composite model: 0.91 [0.87-0.94]; the radiomics model: 0.89 [0.84-0.94]; the clinical model: 0.88 [0.84-0.92]). Our study underscores the potential of radiomics to preoperatively predict aggressive histologic patterns in LUAD, enabling precise treatment planning and prognosis estimation. Question Can any adjuvant methods address the limitations of core needle biopsies, which are invasive and may not capture the full heterogeneity of lung adenocarcinoma? Findings In a prospective study of 528 patients with cT1N0M0 lung adenocarcinoma, a composite model of clinical characteristics, conventional CT findings, and radiomics features predicted high-grade cancers. Clinical relevance Preoperative non-invasive diagnosis of histologically high-grade tumors using radiomics analysis offers crucial information for the treatment of lung adenocarcinoma with respect to occult lymph node metastasis and recurrence rate.",2134
39939420,MRI-based scoring systems for selective lateral lymph node dissection in locally advanced low rectal cancer after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy.,European radiology,2025,"To develop scoring systems to predict the need for selective lateral lymph node dissection (LLND) alongside total mesorectal excision (TME) in patients with locally advanced low rectal cancer after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT), focusing on lateral local recurrence (LLR) and lateral lymph node (LLN) metastasis. This retrospective study included 607 patients with mrT3/T4 rectal cancer located within 8 cm of the anal verge who underwent nCRT and TME. A development group was used to develop a scoring system predicting the necessity of LLND using logistic regression analysis, incorporating primary tumor and LLN features observed on rectal MRI. External validation was performed in an independent group of 144 patients. We also analyzed risk factors for recurrence and residual LLNs after LLND. Model 1 included pretreatment LLN size and extramural venous invasion (EMVI). Model 2 incorporated pretreatment internal iliac and obturator lymph node sizes, EMVI, and nonresponsive LLN on restaging MRI. Model 3 focused solely on nonresponsive LLN on restaging MRI. In the development group, Models 1 and 2 exhibited better performance (area under the curve (AUC) = 0.92 and 0.90, respectively) than Model 3 (AUC = 0.79), consistent with the validation group. Among patients who underwent LLND, the distal internal iliac compartment had more residual lymph nodes than other compartments (p = 0.02). Scoring systems utilizing LLN features and EMVI on MRI might aid in decision-making for selective LLND following nCRT in locally advanced low rectal cancer. Question The criteria for when additional lateral lymph node dissection (LLND) may benefit in locally advanced low rectal cancer have not yet been definitively established. Findings Scoring systems (Model 1, 2) based on preoperative MRI utilize lateral lymph node (LLN) size and extramural venous invasion to predict the necessity of LLND. Clinical relevance The selective LLND along with total mesorectal excision aids in managing LLN metastasis and lateral local recurrence in locally advanced low rectal cancer after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. The imaging-based scoring systems may guide clinical decision-making for selective LLND.",2201

Literature was searched on PubMed and Web of Science (end date: May 7, 2024). Quality of eligible papers was assessed using METhodological RadiomICs Score (METRICS) and Radiomics Quality Score (RQS). Reliability of quality scoring tools were analyzed. Meta-analysis, meta-regression, and subgroup analysis were performed. Twenty-seven papers were included in the qualitative assessment. Mean average METRICS score and RQS percentage score across three readers was 57% (SD, 14%) and 16% (SD, 12%), respectively. Score-wise inter-rater agreement for METRICS ranged from poor to excellent, while RQS demonstrated moderate to excellent agreement. Item-wise agreement was moderate for both tools. Meta-analysis of 11 eligible studies yielded an estimated area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.832 (95% CI, 0.757-0.908), with significant heterogeneity (I While a good performance was noted for radiomics, results should be interpreted cautiously due to heterogeneity, publication bias, and quality issues thoroughly examined in this study. Question Radiomic literature on distinguishing radiation-induced brain injury from glioma recurrence lacks systematic reviews and meta-analyses that assess methodological quality using radiomics-specific tools. Findings While the results are encouraging, there was substantial heterogeneity, publication bias toward positive findings, and notable concerns regarding methodological quality. Clinical relevance Meta-analysis results need cautious interpretation due to significant problems detected during the analysis (e.g., suboptimal quality, heterogeneity, bias), which may help explain why radiomics has not yet been translated into clinical practice.",1845

This study included 38 patients with histologically confirmed sinonasal MM, who underwent DKI, IVIM, and DCE-MRI. Patient-derived tumor xenograft models and precision-cut tumor slices were established to evaluate tumor response to imatinib. Whole-tumor histogram analysis was conducted on imaging parameters, and logistic regression models were applied to determine the predictive value of these metrics in differentiating responders from nonresponders. Among the 38 patients with sinonasal MM, 12 were classified as responders and 26 as nonresponders based on patient-derived tumor xenograft and precision-cut tumor slice model responses to imatinib. The DKI model revealed significant differences in mean, median, 10th percentile, and 90th percentile values of Dk and K between responders and nonresponders (P < 0.05). The IVIM model indicated significant differences in 10th percentile and mean values of D, with kurtosis f being a strong predictor. The DCE-MRI model, using the 90th percentile Ktrans metric, demonstrated robust predictive performance, achieving an AUC of 0.89, with 80.77% specificity and 91.67% sensitivity. The combined logistic model integrating DKI, IVIM, and DCE-MRI metrics produced the highest predictive accuracy, with an AUC of 0.90.

Although hormonal regulation of BPE at breast MRI has been investigated, information regarding hormonal regulation of BPE at contrast-enhanced mammography (CEM) remains scarce. Purpose To investigate how BPE at CEM changes across various short- and long-term physiologic and pharmacologic hormonal effects, including menopausal status, lactation, hormone replacement therapy (HRT), and tamoxifen therapy and its cessation. Materials and Methods This retrospective study included CEM examinations performed between December 2012 and January 2024. A computational search was performed to identify CEMs performed in patients with various hormonal statuses and several subgroups of patients were identified, including premenopausal, postmenopausal, lactating, HRT, and tamoxifen subgroups. For patients who received tamoxifen therapy, the first follow-up image at treatment cessation was included, when available. The four ordinal BPE grades, ranging from minimal to marked, as reported in the official radiologic reports were used for analysis. Subgroup comparisons were performed using the Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test and χ",1235
39932411,Preoperative Chest CT Myosteatosis Indicates Worse Postoperative Survival in Stage 0-IIB Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.,Radiology,2025,"Background Skeletal muscle density (SMD) and intermuscular adipose tissue (IMAT) are myosteatosis markers. The prognostic value of myosteatosis markers in preoperative risk stratification of patients with early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains unknown. Purpose To assess whether increased myosteatosis markers at chest CT before lung resection of early-stage NSCLC are associated with and predictive of worse overall survival (OS). Materials and Methods This retrospective cohort study included patients with stage 0-IIB NSCLC who underwent lobectomy or bilobectomy at three hospitals between 2014 and 2017. The indexes (cross-sectional area [in centimeters squared] divided by height [in meters squared]) and densities (mean attenuation [in Hounsfield units]) of skeletal muscle, subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT), and IMAT were assessed at CT at the level of the 12th thoracic vertebral body via semiautomated threshold-based segmentation. Associations of SMD and the IMAT index with OS were evaluated via separate Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for skeletal muscle index, SAT index, SAT density, and relevant confounders. The ability of indexes and densities to predict OS was explored with penalized Cox proportional hazards models and internally validated concordance statistics. Results Among 838 patients (median age, 68 years [IQR, 61-74 years]; 475 [56.7%] female patients), 219 died after a median follow-up of 5.3 years (IQR, 3.0-6.4 years). Increased myosteatosis, represented by decreased SMD and an increased IMAT index, was associated with worse OS (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.87 [95% CI: 0.80, 0.93]; ",1641
39932410,Gadoxetic Acid-enhanced MRI Scoring Model to Predict Pathologic Features of Hepatocellular Carcinoma.,Radiology,2025,"Background Prediction of high-risk pathologic features such as microvascular invasion (MVI), poorly differentiated pathologic grade (poor PG), and satellite nodules (SNs) has significant clinical value, as these features are associated with early recurrence and metastasis in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Purpose To develop and validate a preoperative scoring model using gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI features for noninvasive prediction of HCC high-risk pathologic features and early recurrence. Materials and Methods This retrospective study included consecutive patients with HCC who underwent preoperative gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI at three centers (one training dataset and two external validation datasets) between January 2014 and January 2021. The preoperative imaging characteristics of each patient were evaluated via multivariable logistic regression, using surgical specimen pathologic evaluation as the reference standard, for prediction of MVI, poor PG, and SNs. In the training dataset, eight intratumoral features, three peritumoral features, and three laboratory indicators were initially evaluated. A scoring model was developed based on the results of the logistic regression, with the following imaging features demonstrating significant independent association with high-risk pathologic features: diameter greater than 4.0 cm, irregular morphology, intratumoral arteries, peritumoral enhancement in the arterial phase, and low peritumoral signal intensity. The resulting score, called the Image score (I-score), to predict early recurrence of HCC in patients was further validated in an outcome dataset. Results A total of 366 patients (median age, 57 years [IQR, 49-64 years]; 314 men, 52 women) from the three centers were included in the training dataset (",1783

A total of 1368 patients who underwent MRI examinations before ICT from three hospitals were retrospectively enrolled and divided into training, internal validation, external validation, and cross-field strength validation cohorts. Significant radiomics and clinical features were selected from coarse to fine. An interpretable genetic algorithm-enhanced artificial neural network (GNN) was applied for models' development and validation. The performance of junior and senior doctors in predicting ICT response with and without model aid was evaluated. The interpretable GNN model achieved good generalization performance in predicting ICT response, with areas under the curve (AUCs) ranging from 0.808 to 0.864 across all cohorts. Survival analysis demonstrated that low-risk patients defined by GNN-radiomics signature and clinical factors had better progression-free survival than high-risk patients in all cohorts (hazard ratio ranging from 3.231 to 12.787, p < 0.05). The predictive performance of junior and senior doctors for ICT response significantly improved with model assistance (AUCs: 0.686 vs. 0.785 and 0.736 vs. 0.836, p < 0.05). An interpretable, applicable, and generalized GNN model based on multi-center databases achieved superior performance in predicting ICT response and survival in LANPC patients, which may contribute to the personalized treatment of LANPC. Question Currently, there is a lack of accurate methods for predicting and evaluating the efficacy and prognosis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Findings Genetic algorithm-enhanced artificial neural network model excels in predicting induction chemotherapy response and survival outcome of NPC, providing valuable assistance to doctors in clinical practice. Clinical relevance This model can identify patients likely to benefit from induction chemotherapy, promoting individualized treatment and optimizing clinical management.",2153

Patients with hepatic observations ≤ 3.0 cm who underwent preoperative gadoxetate-enhanced MRI and surgical resection were retrospectively analyzed. In LI-RADS + AFP, LR-4 (probably-HCC), LR-M (probably or definitely-malignant but not HCC specific), or LR-TIV (definite-tumor-in-vein) by LI-RADS v2018 was upgraded to LR-5 (definitely-HCC) if they met AFP criteria based on three different cut-offs (≥ 20, ≥ 200, ≥ 400 ng/mL). The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of LI-RADS v2018 LR-5 and LI-RADS + AFP LR-5 were compared using generalized estimating equations. Recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) in the two groups (LR-4/5 vs. LR-M) of LI-RADS v2018 and LI-RADS + AFP were compared using log-rank tests. In 520 observations from 414 patients (mean age, 60 ± 9 years; 328 men), LI-RADS + AFP ≥ 20 ng/mL (LI-RADS + AFP20) showed the highest accuracy among the three cut-offs. Compared to LI-RADS v2018, LI-RADS + AFP20 showed significantly higher sensitivity in diagnosing HCC (79.9% [95% confidence interval, 75.7-83.6] vs. 71.8% [67.2-76.1], p < 0.001) and accuracy (82.7% [79.2-85.9] vs. 76.9% [73.1-80.5], p < 0.001) without difference in specificity (93.5% [87.1-97.4] vs. 96.3% [90.8-99.0], p = 0.083). Unlike LI-RADS v2018, showing no difference in RFS between LR-4/5 and LR-M (50.6 vs. 42.6 months; p = 0.078), LI-RADS + AFP20 showed significant differences in RFS (50.6 vs. 35.0 months; p < 0.001) and OS (67.6 vs. 54.8 months, p = 0.008). Combining AFP and LI-RADS v2018 resulted in better diagnostic performance and superior post-surgical prognostication compared to LI-RADS v2018 alone. Question Serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) is a commonly used tumor biomarker for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but there are no studies that applied serum AFP in CT/MRI LI-RADS. Findings Combining serum AFP and LI-RADS v2018 had better diagnostic performance for diagnosing HCC ≤ 3.0 cm and superior post-surgical prognostication than LI-RADS v2018 alone. Clinical relevance Integrating serum AFP with LI-RADS v2018 on gadoxetate-enhanced MRI improves the diagnosis and prognostication of HCC patients. These findings provide clinicians with a more robust diagnostic and prognostic framework for managing patients with HCC ≤ 3.0 cm.",2513

The protocol was amended during the course of the study to assess whether addition of AAP increases bone loss. Patients were randomized to receive either ADT + D with or without AAP. Bone mineral density (BMD) of the lumbar spine, femoral neck, and total hip were measured by dual X-ray absorptiometry at baseline, 6, 12, and 24 months (M). T-Scores and mean percent change in BMD values were assessed. With 97 patients treated with AAP and 98 without, the median age was 65 years and 69 patients were ECOG 0 in each arm. Median baseline body mass index was 25.6 and 26.5 kg/m This is the first prospective assessment of BMD in a randomized trial with an experimental treatment using AAP. Bone loss occurred rapidly in both arms, and addition of AAP did not increase bone loss significantly although a numerically higher rate of osteoporosis was observed at 2 years. NCT01957436.",1122
39922972,Dual-energy CT extracellular volume fraction predicts tumor collagen ratio and possibly survival for inoperable pancreatic cancer patients.,European radiology,2025,"Tumor collagen is vital in chemotherapy resistance of pancreatic cancer (PC), but its non-invasive evaluation remains challenging. This study aims to investigate the association of variables derived from dual-energy CT with the collagen ratio (CR) of PC and to determine the prognostic value of CR in unresectable diseases. A total of 83 patients with resected PC and 71 patients with unresectable PC were enrolled. In the resected group, the correlation between the tumor CR and variables of dual-energy CT was analyzed. In the unresectable group, Cox regression analyses were conducted to investigate the prognostic value of dual-energy CT-predicted CR and other clinicoradiological indicators. The patients with resected PC were divided into low and high-CR sets with a threshold of 55%. In the resected group, the extracellular volume fraction calculated by the iodine concentration (ECV_IC) was the only predictor of tumor CR according to univariate and multivariate analysis (hazard ratio [HR] (95% confidence interval [CI]):1.19 [1.03-1.37]). The correlation coefficient r was 0.26 (p = 0.02) between ECV_IC and specific CR values. In the training set of unresectable PC group, ECV_IC (HR (95% CI): 0.94 (0.89-0.99), p = 0.03) and contrast-enhanced pattern (CEP) (HR (95% CI): 3.20 (1.41-7.27), p = 0.01) were independent prognostic factors for overall survival. The nomogram model was constructed and showed a good performance. The ECV_IC is a non-invasive indicator of tumor CR in PC. The ECV_IC and CEP have the potential to predict the prognosis of unresectable PC. Question Non-invasive evaluation of tumor collagen, a vital determinant of chemotherapy resistance of pancreatic cancer, remains challenging. Findings Tumor collagen ratio can be noninvasively predicted by extracellular volume fraction based on iodine concentration. Clinical relevance The nomogram model composed of extracellular volume fraction and contrast-enhanced pattern can serve as an effective and convenient tool for stratifying the prognosis of patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer.",2078

One hundred and thirty-four patients (recurrence/distant metastasis group, n = 36; non-metastasis/non-recurrence group, n = 98) with RC who underwent radical resection and DECT were retrospectively included. DECT quantitative parameters, including iodine concentration (IC), normalized iodine concentration (NIC), electron density (Rho), effective atomic number (Z Patients in the metastasis/recurrence group had higher Rho in arterial phase (A-Rho), NIC in venous phase (V-NIC), Rho in venous phase (V-Rho), Z Combining V-NIC, V-λ Question TNM staging fails to accurately prognosticate; can quantitative parameters derived from dual-energy CT predict prognosis in patients with resectable rectal cancer? Findings Normalized iodine concentration (V-NIC) and the slope of the spectral Hounsfield unit curve in venous phase (V-λHU), and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) are independent risk factors for recurrence/metastasis. Clinical relevance The combined indicator integrating V-NIC, V-λHU, and CEA could predict 3-year disease-free survival in patients with resectable rectal cancer and could aid in postoperative survival risk stratification to guide personalized treatment.",1327
39920303,Predicting axillary residual disease after neoadjuvant therapy in breast cancer using baseline MRI and ultrasound.,European radiology,2025,"To predict axillary node residual disease in women treated for node-positive breast cancer (BC) by neoadjuvant therapy (NAT), using breast BI-RADS MRI features and axillary ultrasound at baseline. In this single-center, retrospective study, women with node-positive BC who underwent NAT between 2016 and 2021 were included. Pre-treatment axillary US and breast MRIs were evaluated using the BI-RADS lexicon and T2 features, including Breast Edema Score. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted for the prediction of axillary residual disease (ARD). A multivariable model based on logistic regression was trained and evaluated on randomly split train and test sets (7:3 ratio). Out of the 141 women, 41% had post-NAT ARD. Axillary metastasis was independently associated with luminal subtype (odds ratio (OR), 25.5; p < 0.001), anterior tumor location (OR, 14.1; p = 0.008), and cortical thickening ≥ 7 mm (OR, 6.09; p = 0.002). Intratumoral T2 high signal intensity was protective (OR, 0.16; p = 0.006), while Ki67 had a marginal association (p = 0.064). In the training and test sets, the model, which is available online, achieved AUCs of 0.860 (95% CI: 0.783-0.936) and 0.843 (95% CI: 0.714-0.971), respectively. Anterior depth location and cortical thickening greater than 7 mm were also independently associated with post-NAT axillary burden. Adjusting for BC subtype and KI-67 index, the anterior third location of BC, a cortical thickness greater than 7 mm, and the absence of intratumoral T2 hyperintensity is predictive of ARD after NAT. Question What baseline imaging-based predictive models can identify patients at risk of persistent nodal disease after neoadjuvant therapy? Findings Baseline US cortical thickness superior to 7 mm, anterior tumor location, and absence of an intratumoral high signal on T2-weighted MRI predict residual axillary disease. Clinical relevance Our predictive model, available online at: litoic.shinyapps.io/LNPred_Apps , including breast cancer subtype, Ki-67 index level, breast cancer location, intratumoral signal intensity on T2WI, and initial lymph node thickness, could guide post-NAT axillary management.",2185

39915321,Soft-tissue sarcoma: modified grading method improves the accuracy of preoperative MRI in predicting patient outcomes.,European radiology,2025,"To explore whether incorporating the Ki-67 expression into the modified grading method improves the accuracy of preoperative MRI features in predicting patient outcomes. This retrospective study analyzed STS patients treated from February 2013 to August 2022. Preoperative MR images, FNCLCC grades, Ki-67 expressions, and follow-up information were recorded. Grade II patients with high Ki-67 expression and all Grade III sarcoma patients were defined as the high-grade group. The clinical usefulness of the four grading methods was also compared. MR images were evaluated to extract 17 oncologic, intratumoral, and peritumoral features. High-grade relevant MRI features were identified by multivariate binary logistic regression. Kaplan-Meier and Cox risk regression methods were performed for prognostic analysis of high-grade relevant MRI feature combinations. Overall 207 STS patients were included (mean age ± standard deviation, 59.5 ± 13.2 years). According to the modified grading method, 99 patients were classified in the high-grade group. The modified grading method was superior to the two traditional grading methods in predicting patient outcomes. According to multivariate analysis, a tumor size greater than 10 cm (odds ratio (OR), 5.44), a necrosis volume greater than 50% (OR, 2.71), peritumoral enhancement (OR, 3.06), and a multilobulated configuration (OR, 3.27) were associated with high-grade STS. At least three of the four MRI features were associated with worse overall and metastasis-free survival. The modified grading system demonstrated improved reliability in managing sarcoma patients. The combination of preoperative MRI features may predict high-grade sarcoma and, potentially, poor patient survival and metastasis. Question Does an improved grading method that considers Ki-67 expression and FNCLCC grading correlate with MRI features and improve prognostication of soft-tissue sarcoma (STS)? Findings MRI features, including tumor size, necrosis volume, peritumoral enhancement, and multilobulated configuration, are associated with high-grade STS, overall survival, and metastasis-free survival. Clinical relevance The modified grading method improves the accuracy of predicting patients' OS and MFS compared to conventional grading methods. Radiologists can suggest STS patients with potentially poor clinical outcomes and guide personalized treatment through high-grade associated MRI features.",2433
39909901,Refining imaging criteria for mucinous cystic neoplasm of the liver: simplified diagnostic approach.,European radiology,2025,"To propose a simplified diagnostic approach for mucinous cystic neoplasm (MCN) of the liver and compare its diagnostic performance with the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) criteria. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 124 patients with pathologically confirmed lesions (13 MCNs, 111 hepatic cysts) who underwent CT/MRI between January 2016 and January 2023. Two major features (thick septation, nodularity) and five minor features (upstream biliary dilatation, thin septations, internal hemorrhage, perfusion change, < 3 coexistent hepatic cysts) of the EASL criteria were evaluated. For a septa-wall relationship, the angle of indentation was measured, and the optimal angle predicting MCN was determined by receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. Logistic regression identified features predicting MCN, and a modified criteria was developed. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of both criteria were compared using McNemar's test. The optimal indentation angle was 111°. Absence of indentation or indentation at an angle > 111° (odds ratio (OR), 100.4; 95% confidence interval (CI), 4.9-2076.0) and < 3 coexistent hepatic cysts (OR, 47.8; 95% CI, 1.5-1489.1) were independent features predicting MCN. Our modified criteria used a combination of them and demonstrated greater accuracy (98.4% vs. 92.7%; p = 0.035) than the EASL criteria (a combination of ≥ 1 major and ≥ 1 minor feature[s]), with comparable sensitivity (92.3% vs. 76.9%; p = 0.317) and specificity (99.1% vs. 94.6%; p = 0.059). Our modified criteria using two imaging features may be a promising alternative to current EASL criteria to improve accuracy in diagnosing MCN. Question Radiological diagnosis of mucinous cystic neoplasm of the liver remains challenging due to the lack of specific imaging features, leading to suboptimal treatment decisions. Findings No external indentation or an indentation angle > 111° and fewer than 3 coexistent hepatic cysts are independent factors predicting mucinous cystic neoplasm of the liver. Clinical relevance The simplified approach using these two imaging features for diagnosing mucinous cystic neoplasm of the liver offers improved accuracy and reliability over the 2022 EASL criteria, potentially reducing misdiagnosis and unnecessary surgeries.",2310
39907762,Deep learning-based breast cancer diagnosis in breast MRI: systematic review and meta-analysis.,European radiology,2025,"The aim of this work is to evaluate the performance of deep learning (DL) models for breast cancer diagnosis with MRI. A literature search was conducted on Web of Science, PubMed, and IEEE Xplore for relevant studies published from January 2015 to February 2024. The study was registered with the PROSPERO International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (protocol no. CRD42024485371). The quality assessment of diagnostic accuracy studies-2 (QUADAS2) tool and the Must AI Criteria-10 (MAIC-10) checklist were used to assess quality and risk of bias. The meta-analysis included studies reporting DL for breast cancer diagnosis and their performance, from which pooled summary estimates for the area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity were calculated. A total of 40 studies were included, of which only 21 were eligible for quantitative analysis. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) were used in 62.5% (25/40) of the implemented models, with the remaining 37.5% (15/40) hybrid composite models (HCMs). The pooled estimates of AUC, sensitivity, and specificity were 0.90 (95% CI: 0.87, 0.93), 88% (95% CI: 86, 91%), and 90% (95% CI: 87, 93%), respectively. DL models used for breast cancer diagnosis on MRI achieve high performance. However, there is considerable inherent variability in this analysis. Therefore, continuous evaluation and refinement of DL models is essential to ensure their practicality in the clinical setting. Question Can DL models improve diagnostic accuracy in breast MRI, addressing challenges like overfitting and heterogeneity in study designs and imaging sequences? Findings DL achieved high diagnostic accuracy (AUC 0.90, sensitivity 88%, specificity 90%) in breast MRI, with training size significantly impacting performance metrics (p < 0.001). Clinical relevance DL models demonstrate high accuracy in breast cancer diagnosis using MRI, showing the potential to enhance diagnostic confidence and reduce radiologist workload, especially with larger datasets minimizing overfitting and improving clinical reliability.",2071
39904786,An international survey of diffusion and perfusion magnetic resonance imaging implementation in the head and neck.,European radiology,2025,"The goal of this international survey was to understand how diffusion (DWI) and perfusion imaging (PWI) are being applied to clinical head and neck imaging. An online questionnaire focusing on acquisition, clinical indications, analysis, and reporting of qualitative DWI (QlDWI), quantitative DWI (QnDWI) and dynamic contrast-enhanced PWI (DCE-PWI) in the head and neck was circulated to members of the American Society of Head and Neck Radiology (ASHNR) and European Society of Head and Neck Radiology (ESHNR) over a 3-month period. Descriptive statistics and group comparisons were calculated with SPSS® v27. There were 294 unique respondents (17.6% response rate) from 256 institutions (182 ESHNR, 74 ASHNR). DWI was routinely acquired for some head and neck indications at 95.7% of the respondents' institutions, with 92.5% of radiologists interpreting QlDWI but only 36.7% analysing QnDWI. QlDWI was most frequently applied to primary mucosal masses or the middle ear, whilst QnDWI was routinely used to distinguish tumour histologies, and primary or recurrent carcinoma. DCE-PWI was routinely acquired at 53.6% of institutions and used by 40.8% of respondents, however, there was no clinical scenario in which it was routinely applied by most users. DCE-PWI analysis methods varied, with time-intensity curve classifications being the most frequently reported. Lack of standardisation was identified as a key reason for not implementing QnDWI, whilst numerous factors prevented the adoption of DCE-PWI. There is widespread routine interpretation of QlDWI by head and neck radiologists, but there is considerable variation in the application and analysis of head and neck QnDWI and DCE-PWI. Question How are diffusion (DWI) and dynamic contrast-enhanced perfusion imaging (DCE-PWI) being utilised by head and neck radiologists across a wide range of practices? Findings An international survey demonstrated widespread routine interpretation of qualitative DWI but variable application and analysis of quantitative DWI and DCE-PWI with numerous barriers to implementation. Clinical relevance The survey results will aid discussion on how to standardise and optimally disseminate these MRI techniques in day-to-day practice. More focused education and resource allocation may be required to accelerate the adoption of quantitative DWI and DCE-PWI.",2350
39904127,Paradigm shift in early detection: Lung cancer screening to comprehensive CT screening.,"European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",2025,"Large-scale lung cancer screening implementation combined with improvements in early detection techniques for three major tobacco-related diseases presents a rare opportunity to markedly improve population health outcomes for millions of people. Chest CT enables routine detection of early lung cancer as well as characterizing coronary calcium and detecting early emphysema in the course of lung cancer screening. Integrated preventive care centered on comprehensive chest CT screening has the potential to bring large benefits across co-morbid diseases with a common etiology. The current one-disease/ silo paradigm of medical practice is an obstacle to maximizing chest CT screening's benefits. The large potential for improved health outcomes across the world demands careful public health, quality assurance, and health policy considerations. A systematic analysis of imaging and health data from ongoing chest CT screening could accelerate this paradigm shift through sustained optimization of screening detection, quantitation and management for the three most lethal tobacco-related co-morbidities. To coordinate this effort to advance progress with implementing the full benefit of comprehensive chest CT screening, a new multi- disciplinary professional and advocacy consortium has been developed to foster collaboration to realize the future of multi-disease chest CT screening.",1389
39903238,Age-stratified deep learning model for thyroid tumor classification: a multicenter diagnostic study.,European radiology,2025,"Thyroid cancer, the only cancer that uses age as a specific predictor of survival, is increasing in incidence, yet it has a low mortality rate, which can lead to overdiagnosis and overtreatment. We developed an age-stratified deep learning (DL) model (hereafter, ASMCNet) for classifying thyroid nodules and aimed to investigate the effect of age stratification on the accuracy of a DL model, exploring how ASMCNet can help radiologists improve diagnostic performance and avoid unnecessary biopsies. In this retrospective study, we used ultrasound images from three hospitals, a total of 10,391 images of 5934 patients were used for training, validation, and testing. The performance of ASMCNet was compared with that of model-trained non-age-stratified radiologists with different experience levels on the test data set with the DeLong method. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), sensitivity, and specificity of ASMCNet were 0.906, 86.1%, and 85.1%, respectively, which exceeded those of model-trained non-age-stratified (0.867, 83.2%, and 75.5%, respectively; p < 0.001) and higher than all of the radiologists (p < 0.001). Reader studies show that radiologists' performances are improved when assisted by the explaining heatmaps (p < 0.001). Our study demonstrates that age stratification based on DL can further improve the performance of thyroid tumor classification models, which also suggests that age is an important factor in the diagnosis of thyroid tumors. The ASMCNet model shows promising clinical applicability and can assist radiologists in improving diagnostic accuracy. Question Age is crucial for differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC) prognosis, yet its diagnostic impact lacks research. Findings Adding age stratification to DL models can further improve the accuracy of thyroid nodule diagnosis. Clinical relevance Age-stratified multimodal classification network is a reliable tool used to help radiologists diagnose thyroid nodules, and integrating it into clinical practice can improve diagnostic accuracy and reduce unnecessary biopsies or treatments.",2108
39903072,Leveraging Large Language Models to Generate Clinical Histories for Oncologic Imaging Requisitions.,Radiology,2025,"Background Clinical information improves imaging interpretation, but physician-provided histories on requisitions for oncologic imaging often lack key details. Purpose To evaluate large language models (LLMs) for automatically generating clinical histories for oncologic imaging requisitions from clinical notes and compare them with original requisition histories. Materials and Methods In total, 207 patients with CT performed at a cancer center from January to November 2023 and with an electronic health record clinical note coinciding with ordering date were randomly selected. A multidisciplinary team informed selection of 10 parameters important for oncologic imaging history, including primary oncologic diagnosis, treatment history, and acute symptoms. Clinical notes were independently reviewed to establish the reference standard regarding presence of each parameter. After prompt engineering with seven patients, GPT-4 (version 0613; OpenAI) was prompted on April 9, 2024, to automatically generate structured clinical histories for the 200 remaining patients. Using the reference standard, LLM extraction performance was calculated (recall, precision, F1 score). LLM-generated and original requisition histories were compared for completeness (proportion including each parameter), and 10 radiologists performed pairwise comparison for quality, preference, and subjective likelihood of harm. Results For the 200 LLM-generated histories, GPT-4 performed well, extracting oncologic parameters from clinical notes (F1 = 0.983). Compared with original requisition histories, LLM-generated histories more frequently included parameters critical for radiologist interpretation, including primary oncologic diagnosis (99.5% vs 89% [199 and 178 of 200 histories, respectively]; ",1784
39903070,Using AI to Select Women with Intermediate Breast Cancer Risk for Breast Screening with MRI.,Radiology,2025,"Background Combined mammography and MRI screening is not universally accessible for women with intermediate breast cancer risk due to limited MRI resources. Selecting women for MRI by assessing their mammogram may enable more resource-effective screening. Purpose To explore the feasibility of using a commercial artificial intelligence (AI) system at mammography to stratify women with intermediate risk for supplemental MRI or no MRI. Materials and Methods This retrospective study included consecutive women with intermediate risk screened with mammography and MRI between January 2003 and January 2020 at a Dutch university medical center. An AI system was used to independently evaluate all mammograms, providing a case-based score that ranked the likelihood of a malignancy on a scale of 1-10. Different AI thresholds for supplemental MRI screening were tested, balancing cancer detection against the number of women needing to undergo MRI. Univariate analyses were used to explore associations between personal factors (age, breast density, and duration of screening participation) and AI results. Results In 760 women (mean age, 48.9 years ± 10.5 [SD]), 2819 combined screening examinations were performed, and 37 breast cancers were detected. Use of AI at mammography achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.72 (95% CI: 0.63, 0.81) for the entire intermediate-risk population and 0.81 (95% CI: 0.69, 0.93) for women with prior breast cancer. Using a threshold score of 5, 31 of 37 (84%) breast cancers were detected, including 13 of 19 (68%) mammographically occult cancers, at a supplemental breast MRI rate of 50% (1409 of 2819 examinations). No significant association between breast density or age and the probability of a false-negative AI result was found. Conclusion Using AI at mammography to select women for supplemental MRI effectively identified women with higher breast cancer risk in an intermediate-risk population, including women with mammographically occult cancers. AI selection of women with intermediate risk for supplemental MRI screening has the potential to reduce screening burden and costs, while maintaining a high cancer detection rate. © RSNA, 2025.",2219
39890617,A practical work around for breast density distribution discrepancies between mammographic images from different vendors.,European radiology,2025,"Investigate the impact of mammography device grouped by vendor on volumetric breast density and propose a method that mitigates biases when determining the proportion of high-density women. Density grade class and volumetric breast density distributions were obtained from mammographic images from three different vendor devices in different centers using breast density evaluation software in a retrospective study. Density distributions were compared across devices with a Mann-Whitney U test and breast density thresholds corresponding to distribution percentiles calculated. A method of matching density percentiles is proposed to determine women at potentially high risk while mitigating possible bias due to the device used for screening. 2083 (mean age 59 ± 5.4), 531 (mean age 58.8 ± 5.7) and 244 (mean age 60.7 ± 6.0) screened women were evaluated on three vendor devices, respectively. Both the density grade distribution and the volumetric breast density were different between Vendor 1 and Vendor 2 data (p < 0.001) and between Vendor 1 and Vendor 3 data (p < 0.001). Between Vendor 2 and Vendor 3, no significant difference was observed (p = 0.67 for density grade, p = 0.29 for volumetric density). To recruit the top 10% of women with extremely dense breasts required respective density thresholds of 16.1%, 13.6% and 13.8% for the three vendor devices. Density grade class and volumetric breast density distributions differ between devices grouped by vendor and can result in statistically different breast density distributions. Percentile-dependent density thresholds can ensure unbiased selection of high-risk women. Question Does the use of x-ray systems from different vendors influence breast density evaluation and the resulting selection of high-risk women during breast cancer screening? Findings Statistically significant differences were observed between breast density distributions of different vendors; a method of matching via percentiles is proposed to prevent biased density evaluations. Clinical relevance Measured breast density distributions differed between X-ray devices. A workaround is proposed that determines density thresholds corresponding to a specified population, allowing the same proportion of women to be selected with a density algorithm.",2289
39888408,Radiological features of desmoid-type fibromatosis: a two-institution retrospective study.,European radiology,2025,"To characterize the radiological findings of desmoid-type fibromatosis (DF). This two-institution retrospective study included 152 patients with pathologically confirmed DF who underwent computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET)/CT between January 2001 and February 2024. Two board-certified radiologists independently evaluated the CT, MRI, and FDG-PET/CT findings, and a third board-certified radiologist resolved discrepancies. Imaging was performed with and without contrast media: 70 patients underwent plain CT, 95 underwent contrast-enhanced (CE) CT, 115 patients underwent plain MRI examinations, 100 patients underwent CE-MRI, and 11 patients underwent FDG-PET/CT (most patients underwent several modalities). The median age of the patients was 40 years, with a female predominance (male, 39.5% vs female, 60.5%). Swelling or palpable mass was the most frequent symptom (78/152, 51.3%). Gross total resection of DF was performed in 57 patients, with a recurrence rate of 38.6% (22/57). Tumors were most frequently observed in the extra-abdominal region (79/152, 51.6%). Characteristic radiological features included intermediate intensity on T2-weighted imaging (112/113, 99.1%), intermediate-to-high intensity on T1-weighted imaging (109/111, 98.2%), substantial enhancement in the late phase on MRI (100/100, 100%), moderate to strong enhancement in the late phase on CT (18/20, 90%), and arterial penetration sign on CE-CT (25/96, 26.0%). The mean apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) of DFs was 1.46 × 10 This study highlights the unique imaging features of DF, including the arterial penetration sign and high mean ADC values, which can aid in differentiating DF from other soft tissue tumors. These findings may improve preoperative diagnostic accuracy and reduce the need for invasive procedures. Question Imaging findings of DF are not well-documented in large-scale studies. Findings This study identifies unique imaging features of DF, such as the arterial penetration sign and high mean ADC values. Clinical relevance These distinctive imaging characteristics improve diagnostic accuracy for DF and lead to appropriate patient management, as DF requires distinct treatment strategies.",2287
39883158,Multiparametric MRI-based machine learning system of molecular subgroups and prognosis in medulloblastoma.,European radiology,2025,"We aimed to use artificial intelligence to accurately identify molecular subgroups of medulloblastoma (MB), predict clinical outcomes, and incorporate deep learning-based imaging features into the risk stratification. The MRI features were extracted for molecular subgroups by a novel multi-parameter convolutional neural network (CNN) called Bi-ResNet-MB. Then, MR features were used to establish a prognosis model based on XGBoost. Finally, a novel risk stratification system to stratify the patients based on the M A total of 139 MB patients (36 female, average age 7.27 ± 3.62 years) were treated at Beijing Tiantan Hospital. The Bi-ResNet-MB model excelled in molecular subgroup classification, achieving an average AUC of 0.946 (95% CI: 0.899-0.993). For prognostic prediction, our models achieved AUCs of 0.840 (95% CI: 0.792-0.888), 0.949 (95% CI: 0.899-0.999), and 0.960 (95% CI: 0.915-1.000) for OS, and 0.946 (95% CI: 0.905-0.987), 0.932 (95% CI: 0.875-0.989), and 0.964 (95% CI: 0.921-1.000) for PFS at 1, 3, and 5 years. In an independent validation dataset of 108 patients (33 female, average age 7.11 ± 2.92 years), the average AUC of molecular subgroup classification reached 0.894 (95% CI: 0.797-1.000). For PFS prediction at 1, 3, and 5 years, the AUCs were 0.832 (95% CI: 0.724-0.920), 0.875 (95% CI: 0.781-0.967), and 0.907 (95% CI: 0.760-1.000), respectively. Based on machine learning and MRI data, models for MB molecular subgroups and prognosis prediction and the novel risk stratification system may significantly benefit patients. Question Medulloblastoma exhibits significant heterogeneity, leading to considerable variations in patient prognosis and there is a lack of effective risk assessment strategies. Findings We have constructed a comprehensive machine learning system that excels in subgrouping diagnosis, prognosis assessment, and risk stratification for medulloblastoma patients preoperatively. Clinical relevance The utilization of non-invasive preoperative diagnosis and assessment is advantageous for clinicians in creating personalized treatment plans, particularly for high-risk patients. Additionally, it lays a foundation for the subsequent implementation of neoadjuvant therapy for medulloblastoma.",2244
39881038,A radiopathomics model for predicting large-number cervical lymph node metastasis in clinical N0 papillary thyroid carcinoma.,European radiology,2025,"This study aimed to develop a multimodal radiopathomics model utilising preoperative ultrasound (US) and fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) to predict large-number cervical lymph node metastasis (CLNM) in patients with clinically lymph node-negative (cN0) papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). This multicentre retrospective study included patients with PTC between October 2017 and June 2024 across seven institutions. Patients were categorised based on the presence or absence of large-number CLNM in training, validation, and external testing cohorts. A clinical model was developed based on the maximum diameter of thyroid nodules. Radiomics features were extracted from US images and pathomics features were extracted from FNAC images. Feature selection was performed using univariate analysis, correlation analysis, and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression. Six machine learning (ML) algorithms were employed to construct radiomics, pathomics, and radiopathomics models. Predictive performance was assessed using the area under the curve (AUC), and decision curve analysis (DCA). A total of 426 patients with PTC (41.65 ± 12.47 years; 124 men) were included in this study, with 213 (50%) exhibiting large-number CLNM. The multimodal radiopathomics model demonstrated excellent predictive capabilities with AUCs 0.921, 0.873, 0.903; accuracies (ACCs) 0.852, 0.800, 0.833; sensitivities (SENs) 0.876, 0.867, 0.857; specificities (SPEs) 0.829, 0.733, 0.810, for the training, validation, and testing cohorts, respectively. It significantly outperformed the clinical model (AUCs 0.730, 0.698, 0.630; ACCs 0.690, 0.656, 0.627; SENs 0.686, 0.378, 0.556; SPEs 0.695, 0.933, 0.698), the radiomics model (AUCs 0.819, 0.762, 0.783; ACCs 0.752, 0.722, 0.738; SENs 0.657, 0.844, 0.937; SPEs 0.848, 0.600, 0.540), and the pathomics model (AUCs 0.882, 0.786, 0.800; ACCs 0.829, 0.756, 0.786; SENs 0.819, 0.889, 0.857; SPEs 0.838, 0.633, 0.714). The multimodal radiopathomics model demonstrated significant advantages in the preoperative prediction of large-number CLNM in patients with cN0 PTC. Question Accurate preoperative prediction of large-number CLNM in PTC patients can guide treatment plans, but single-modality diagnostic performance remains limited. Findings The radiopathomics model utilising preoperative US and FNAC images effectively predicted large-number CLNM in both validation and testing cohorts, outperforming single predictive models. Clinical relevance Our study proposes a multimodal radiopathomics model based on preoperative US and FNAC images, which can effectively predict large-number CLNM in PTC preoperatively and guide clinicians in treatment planning.",2699

We performed a systematic literature search of online scientific publication databases from inception up to July 31, 2024. We used the quality assessment of diagnostic accuracy studies-2 (QUADAS-2) to assess the study quality, and heterogeneity was determined by the Q-test and measured with I A total of 13 studies involving 1341 participants met the inclusion criteria. Pooled summary estimates of sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve of HSROC were 0.79 (95% CI: 0.66-0.88), 0.86 (95% CI: 0.80-0.90), and 0.90 (95% CI: 0.87-0.92). Subgroup analysis showed that the pooled sensitivity and specificity for CT were 0.74 (95% CI: 0.63-0.83) and 0.84 (95% CI: 0.74-0.91), whereas for MRI were 0.84 (95% CI: 0.59-0.95) and 0.88 (95% CI: 0.81-0.93), respectively. Node-RADS demonstrates the promising potential for the prediction of LN invasion, with high specificity but moderate sensitivity, particularly with optimal cutoff value ≥ 3. Indirect comparisons showed no significant difference between CT and MRI regarding overall diagnostic accuracy. Question Since the Node-RADS has been proposed, a number of studies have assessed its diagnostic performance for evaluating LN invasion. Findings Node-RADS demonstrated high specificity but moderate sensitivity, and cutoff ≥ 3 is the optimal threshold; indirect comparison suggested no significant difference between CT and MRI. Clinical relevance This study synthesized currently available evidence on studies of utilizing Node-RADS for assessing LNI in patients with various cancers, providing valuable insights for radiologists for utilizing this new risk scoring system in clinical practice.",1808

Data were retrospectively collected from 17 patients diagnosed with GI ENKTCL-NT, 68 patients with CD, and 47 patients with DLBCL. The CT findings of ENKTCL-NT were analyzed and compared with those of CD and DLBCL. Data were analyzed using SPSS (version 25.0) and MedCalc (version 18.2.1). p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The 17 patients with ENKTCL-NT included 11 males (64.7%) and 6 females (35.3%) (mean age, 46.41 ± 4.12 years). The CT features of ENKTCL-NT included: circumferential symmetric thickening (100%), moderate thickening (70.6%), skip lesions (52.9%), contiguous lesion (47.1%), mucosal or layered enhancement (70.6%), moderate mural enhancement (64.7%) with non-enhanced regions (47.1%), absence of lymphadenopathy (76.5%), bowel perforation or fistula (17.6%), and peri-enteric blurred fat space (70.6%). The presence of circumferential symmetric thickening, moderate mural enhancement, and non-enhanced regions were more indicative of ENKTCL-NT than CD (17/17 vs. 17/68, 11/17 vs. 22/68, 8/17 vs. 0/68, p < 0.05). The presence of skip lesions, mucosal or layered enhancement, and absence of peri-enteric lymphadenopathy were more indicative of ENKTCL-NT than DLBCL (9/17 vs. 2/47, 12/17 vs. 1/37, 13/17 vs. 19/47, p < 0.05). CT imaging features can provide useful information for the early diagnosis of ENKTCL-NT and effectively differentiate it from CD and DLBCL. Question Extranodal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type (ENKTCL-NT) involving the gastrointestinal tract (GI) is highly malignant but easily misdiagnosed by clinicians and endoscopic examination. Findings CT could provide useful information in the diagnosis of ENKTCL-NT involving GI and in differentiating it from Crohn's disease and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Clinical relevance This study will help improve the ability of radiologists to diagnose ENKTCL-NT involving GI, and a more predictive diagnosis will also alert clinicians to perform multiple deep endoscopic biopsies, which will contribute to the early diagnosis and treatment of ENKTCL-NT.",2317
39875612,Diagnostic utility of chest wall vessel involvement sign on ultra-high-resolution CT for primary lung cancer infiltrating the chest wall.,European radiology,2025,"Chest wall infiltration in primary lung cancer affects the surgical and therapeutic strategies. This study evaluates the efficacy of the chest wall vessel involvement in subpleural lung cancer (CWVI)　on ultra-high-resolution CT (UHR-CT) for detecting chest wall invasion. A retrospective analysis of lung cancer cases with confirmed pleural and chest wall invasion was conducted from November 2019 to April 2022. Seventy-seven patients (mean ± standard deviation age 70 ± 8 years, 64 males) who underwent preoperative contrast-enhanced UHR-CT were included. They were grouped into 51 non-chest wall infiltration (pl1 and pl2) and 26 chest wall infiltration (pl3). Clinical, histopathological, and UHR-CT findings were reviewed. Upper lobe tumors exhibited a higher chest wall invasion rate (p < 0.001). Rib destruction was evident in five patients with chest wall invasion but none with pleural invasion (p < 0.001). CWVI was present in 19 of 26 patients with chest wall invasion and 2 of 51 patients with pleural invasion (p < 0.001). The maximum tumor diameter (Dmax), arch distance which means the interface length between the primary tumor and the chest wall (Adist), and the ratio of Dmax to Adist were higher in chest wall invasion cases (all p < 0.001). After excluding patients with rib destruction, in multivariate logistic regression analysis, only CWVI was a significant predictor for chest wall invasion (odds ratio 29.22 (95% confidence interval 9.13-262.90), p < 0.001). CWVI on UHR-CT can help diagnose lung cancer infiltrating the chest wall, offering a potential tool for clinical decision-making. Question Chest wall infiltration in primary lung cancer has implications for the treatment plan, but diagnosis is often difficult with conventional CT. Findings Chest wall vessel involvement in subpleural lung cancer on ultra-high-resolution CT is a valuable predictor for diagnosing chest wall infiltration. Clinical relevance The delineation of chest wall vessels with contrast-enhanced ultra-high-resolution CT may improve the diagnosis of chest wall infiltration and allow accurate staging and optimal treatment options for subpleural primary lung cancer.",2174
39873753,Dual-energy CT iodine concentration as a biomarker for immunotherapy treatment response in metastatic melanoma and renal cell carcinoma patients.,European radiology,2025,"To investigate the predictive value of tumor iodine concentration obtained with dual-energy CT (DECT) for treatment response in patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI). Retrospective single-center study of consecutive metastatic melanoma and renal cell carcinoma (RCC) patients undergoing first-line ICI treatment. The iodine concentration measurement time points include prior to initiation of therapy (baseline [BL]), after initiation (follow-up [FU1]), and either time point nearest to 12 months or at time of progression (final follow-up [FFU]). Target lesion DECT-based whole-volume tumor normalized iodine concentration average (NICave) and size measurements were obtained. Reference standard was individual lesion FFU status categorized as responders or nonresponders per RECIST 1.1. Logistic regression model assessed NICave change and FU1 lesion response as predictors of FFU lesion outcome. Model's performance was summarized with AUC. Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) summarized inter-rater agreement of NICave. Forty-six patients were included (mean age 61 ± 11 years, 12 women; 16 melanoma). Sixty-four of 175 target lesions were confirmed nonresponders at FFU. In a multivariable model, lesion status at FU1 (odds ratio [OR]: 27.4, p < 0.001) and changes in NICave from BL to FU1 (OR: 2.42 per 1-SD increase, p = 0.019) were significant predictors of lesion status at FFU. The model's AUC was 0.86 (95% CI: 0.76-0.93). Inter-rater reliability of NICave was 0.98 (95% CI: 0.97-0.99). Changes in iodine concentration from baseline to first follow-up improve identification of delayed responding metastatic melanoma and RCC lesions treated with immune checkpoint inhibitor, initially classified as nonresponders by size change. Question How can pseudoprogression/delayed treatment response in metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and melanoma patients on first-line immune checkpoint inhibitors be accurately identified? Findings Combining iodine concentration change from Dual-energy CT (baseline to first follow-up) with RECIST-based lesion size change improved prediction of final lesion outcome. Clinical relevance DECT-based whole-volume tumor iodine concentration for target lesions is useful as a predictive imaging biomarker for distinguishing delayed response from true progression in patients with metastatic RCC and melanoma treated with first-line immune checkpoint inhibitors.",2426
39873605,Association of Obesity and Skeletal Muscle with Postoperative Survival in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.,Radiology,2025,"Background A comprehensive assessment of skeletal muscle health is crucial to understanding the association between improved clinical outcomes and obesity as defined by body mass index (BMI; calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) in lung cancer, but limited studies have been conducted on this topic. Purpose To investigate the association between BMI-defined obesity and survival in patients with non-small cell lung cancer who underwent curative resection, with a specific focus on the status of skeletal muscle assessed at CT. Materials and Methods This retrospective study investigated Korean patients with non-small cell lung cancer who underwent curative resection between January 2008 and December 2019. Patients were classified into nonobese (BMI <25) or obese (BMI ≥25) groups. Skeletal muscle status was assessed at CT at the level of the third lumbar vertebrae. Low skeletal muscle mass (LSMM) was defined as the sex-specific lowest quartile. Cox regression analysis was used to evaluate the associations of BMI and muscle status with overall survival. Results A total of 7076 patients (mean age, 62.5 years ± 9.7 [SD]; 4081 male) were included, of whom 2512 (35.5%) had a BMI greater than or equal to 25 (obese group). In the setting of absent LSMM and myosteatosis, patients in the obese group had longer overall survival compared with patients in the nonobese group (hazard ratio [HR], 0.77; 95% CI: 0.66, 0.90; ",1458
39869307,"Receptor CDCP1 Is a Potential Target for Personalized Imaging and Treatment of Poor Outcome HER2+, Triple-Negative, and Metastatic ER+/HER2- Breast Cancers.",Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,2025,"Receptor CUB domain-containing protein 1 (CDCP1) was evaluated as a target for detection and treatment of breast cancer. CDCP1 expression was assessed immunohistochemically in tumors from 423 patients [119 triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC); 75 HER2+; and 229 ER+/HER2-, including 228 primary tumors and 229 lymph node and 47 distant metastases). Cell cytotoxicity induced in vitro by a CDCP1-targeting antibody-drug conjugate (ADC), consisting of the human/mouse chimeric antibody ch10D7 and the microtubule disruptor monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE), was quantified, including in combination with HER-targeting ADC trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1). Detection of CDCP1-expressing primary and metastatic xenografts in mice was examined by PET-CT imaging using zirconium-89-labeled ch10D7. The impact of ch10D7-MMAE on tumor burden and survival in vivo, including in combination with T-DM1, was quantified in cell line and patient-derived xenograft mouse models. CDCP1 is expressed predominantly on the surface of malignant cells of 70% of TNBC, 80% of HER2+ tumors, and increases in ER+/HER2- tumors from 44.9% in primary tumors to 56.4% in lymph node metastases and 74.3% in distant metastases. PET-CT imaging with zirconium-89-labeled ch10D7 is effective for the detection of primary and metastatic CDCP1-expressing TNBC in mice. ADC ch10D7-MMAE kills CDCP1-expressing cells in vitro and controls primary and metastatic TNBC xenografts in mice, conferring significant survival advantages over chemotherapy. It compares favorably to T-DM1 in vivo, and ch10D7-MMAE combined with T-DM1 showed the most potent efficacy, markedly reducing tumor burden of CDCP1+/HER2+ xenografts and prolonging mouse survival, compared with T-DM1 or ch10D7. CDCP1-directed molecular imaging has the potential to identify aggressive breast cancers for CDCP1-targeted treatment.",1853
39862250,Abdominopelvic imaging in the follow-up of testicular germ-cell tumors in adults: recommendations of the Scrotal and Penile Imaging Working Group of the European Society of Urogenital Radiology.,European radiology,2025,"The Scrotal and Penile Imaging Working Group (SPIWG) of the European Society of Urogenital Radiology (ESUR) aimed to formulate recommendations on the imaging modalities and minimal technical requirements for abdominopelvic imaging in the follow-up of adult patients treated for testicular germ-cell tumors (TGCT). The SPIWG members performed an extensive literature search, reviewed the current clinical practice, and reached a consensus based on the opinions of experts in the field. Recurrence in patients treated for TGCT mainly occurs in retroperitoneal lymph nodes (LNs). Abdominopelvic CT and MRI are equivalent assessing retroperitoneal LNs. MRI has the advantage of avoiding radiation exposure, and moreover, diffusion-weighted images (DWI) may increase the detection rates without the need for contrast administration. In patients treated for stage I TGCT, the ESUR-SPIWG recommends MRI over CT for the detection of retroperitoneal LNs during the follow-up after treatment. CT, however, remains the follow-up imaging of choice in patients with advanced disease. When MRI is used, the recommended minimal requirements are at least one high-quality anatomical sequence (T1-WI or T2-WI) in axial and coronal planes, and DWI in the same axial plane, ≤ 4 mm contiguous slices from the diaphragm to the perineum. When CT is used, the recommended minimal requirement is a standard-dose contrast-enhanced CT in the portal-venous phase, scanned from the diaphragm to the perineum. In this paper, the ESUR-SPIWG provides recommendations on the imaging modalities and minimal technical requirements for abdominopelvic imaging in the follow-up of adult patients treated for TGCT. Question There are no recommendations on the preferred imaging modality or scan sequences required for abdominopelvic imaging in the follow-up after treatment for testicular cancers. Findings The European Society of Urogenital Radiology Scrotal and Penile Imaging Working Group (ESUR-SPIWG) provides recommendations for abdominopelvic imaging in follow-up after treatment for testicular cancers. Clinical relevance Recurrence of testicular germ-cell tumors mainly occurs in retroperitoneal lymph nodes. Both CT and MRI provide similar morphological assessments, but radiation exposure can be avoided by using MRI instead of CT.",2304
39862248,Effect of artificial intelligence-aided differentiation of adenomatous and non-adenomatous colorectal polyps at CT colonography on radiologists' therapy management.,European radiology,2025,"Adenomatous colorectal polyps require endoscopic resection, as opposed to non-adenomatous hyperplastic colorectal polyps. This study aims to evaluate the effect of artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted differentiation of adenomatous and non-adenomatous colorectal polyps at CT colonography on radiologists' therapy management. Five board-certified radiologists evaluated CT colonography images with colorectal polyps of all sizes and morphologies retrospectively and decided whether the depicted polyps required endoscopic resection. After a primary unassisted reading based on current guidelines, a second reading with access to the classification of a radiomics-based random-forest AI-model labelling each polyp as ""non-adenomatous"" or ""adenomatous"" was performed. Performance was evaluated using polyp histopathology as the reference standard. 77 polyps in 59 patients comprising 118 polyp image series (47% supine position, 53% prone position) were evaluated unassisted and AI-assisted by five independent board-certified radiologists, resulting in a total of 1180 readings (subsequent polypectomy: yes or no). AI-assisted readings had higher accuracy (76% +/- 1% vs. 84% +/- 1%), sensitivity (78% +/- 6% vs. 85% +/- 1%), and specificity (73% +/- 8% vs. 82% +/- 2%) in selecting polyps eligible for polypectomy (p < 0.001). Inter-reader agreement was improved in the AI-assisted readings (Fleiss' kappa 0.69 vs. 0.92). AI-based characterisation of colorectal polyps at CT colonography as a second reader might enable a more precise selection of polyps eligible for subsequent endoscopic resection. However, further studies are needed to confirm this finding and histopathologic polyp evaluation is still mandatory. Question This is the first study evaluating the impact of AI-based polyp classification in CT colonography on radiologists' therapy management. Findings Compared with unassisted reading, AI-assisted reading had higher accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity in selecting polyps eligible for polypectomy. Clinical relevance Integrating an AI tool for colorectal polyp classification in CT colonography could further improve radiologists' therapy recommendations.",2179
39853335,Discordance between prostate MRI and PSMA-PET/CT: the next big challenge for primary prostate tumor assessment?,European radiology,2025,"An increasing number of patients with prostate cancer (PCa) undergo assessment with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and prostate-specific membrane antigen positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PSMA-PET/CT). This offers comprehensive multimodality staging but can lead to discrepancies. The objective was to assess the rates and types of discordance between MRI and PSMA-PET/CT for primary PCa assessment. Consecutive men diagnosed with intermediate and high-risk PCa who underwent MRI and PSMA-PET/CT in 2021-2023 were retrospectively included. MRI and PSMA-PET/CT were interpreted using PI-RADS v2.1 and PRIMARY scores. Discordances between the two imaging modalities were categorized as ""minor"" (larger or additional lesion seen on one modality) or ""major"" (positive on only one modality or different index lesions between MRI and PSMA-PET/CT) and reconciled using radical prostatectomy or biopsy specimens. Three hundred and nine men (median age 69 years, interquartile range (IQR) 64-75) were included. Most had Gleason Grade Group ≥ 3 PCa (70.9% (219/309)). Median PSA was 9.0 ng/mL (IQR 5.6-13.6). MRI and PSMA-PET/CT were concordant in 157/309 (50.8%) and discordant in 152/309 (49.1%) patients; with 39/152 (25.7%) major and 113/152 (74.3%) minor discordances. Of 27 patients with lesions only seen on MRI, 85.2% (23/27) were clinically significant PCa (csPCa). Of 23 patients with lesions only seen on PSMA-PET/CT, 78.3% (18/23) were csPCa. Altogether, lesions seen on only one modality were csPCa in 80.0% (36/45). MRI and PSMA-PET/CT were discordant in half of patients for primary PCa evaluation, with major discrepancies seen in roughly one out of eight patients. Question While both MRI and PSMA-PET/CT can be used for primary tumor assessment, the discordances between them are not well established. Findings MRI and PSMA-PET/CT were discordant in about half of the patients. Most prostate lesions seen on only one modality were significant cancer. Clinical relevance MRI and PSMA-PET/CT are often discordant for assessing the primary prostate tumor. Using both modalities for primary prostate tumor evaluation can provide complementary information that may substantially impact treatment planning.",2226

39853331,Prediction of immunotherapy response in nasopharyngeal carcinoma: a comparative study using MRI-based radiomics signature and programmed cell death ligand 1 expression score.,European radiology,2025,"To compare an MRI-based radiomics signature with the programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression score for predicting immunotherapy response in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Consecutive patients with NPC who received immunotherapy between January 2019 and June 2022 were divided into training (n = 111) and validation (n = 66) sets. Tumor radiomics features were extracted from pretreatment MR images. PD-L1 combined positive score (CPS) was calculated using immunohistochemistry. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) algorithm was used for feature selection and radiomics signature construction. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed to assess prediction performance. A total of eleven radiomics features with the greatest discrimination capability were identified by the LASSO algorithm to construct the radiomics signature. In predicting patients with objective response to immunotherapy, radiomics score (Rd-score) yielded a significantly higher area under the ROC curve than that of CPS in both the training (0.790 vs. 0.645, p = 0.025) and the validation (0.735 vs. 0.608, p = 0.038) sets. Multivariate analysis identified the Rd-score as an independent influencing factor in predicting immunotherapy response (odds ratio = 19.963, p < 0.001). Kaplan-Meier analysis indicated that patients with Rd-score ≥ 0.5 showed longer progression-free survival than patients with Rd-score < 0.5 (log-rank p < 0.01). An MRI-based radiomics signature demonstrated greater efficacy than the PD-L1 expression score in predicting immunotherapy response in patients with NPC. Question How does an MRI-based radiomics signature compare with the programmed cell death ligand 1 expression score for predicting immunotherapy response in nasopharyngeal carcinoma? Findings The MRI-based radiomics signature demonstrated superior predictive value compared with programmed cell death ligand 1 expression score in identifying immunotherapy responders. Clinical relevance MRI-based radiomics are a promising novel noninvasive tool for predicting immunotherapy outcomes in nasopharyngeal carcinoma.",2139

On lesion-level, location (prostate vs bone OR = 0.23 [0.06-0.83]) and SUV Baseline PSMA PET/CT scans have prognostic value in mCRPC patients and can potentially aid in treatment decision-making. DmaxVox can serve as a simpler alternative to PSMA-TV when automated segmentation software is not available. When combined with PSMA-TV, lower PSA levels indicated worse OS, which may be a marker of tumour dedifferentiation. Further research is needed to validate these models in larger patient cohorts. Question mCRPC is a highly heterogeneous disease, requiring good prognostic markers. Findings PSMA-TV was the best independent prognostic marker for OS; maximum distance between lesions (DmaxVox) can be used as a simpler alternative. Clinical relevance Baseline PSMA PET/CT parameters representing tumour burden were independently associated with OS in mCRPC patients, providing prognostic insights for clinical decision-making. Although PSMA-TV was the best prognostic marker, DmaxVox can serve as an easier to obtain alternative.",1672
39841203,Improved detection of brain metastases using contrast-enhanced 3D black-blood TSE sequences compared to post-contrast 3D T1 GRE: a comparative study on 1.5-T MRI.,European radiology,2025,"Brain metastases are the most common intracranial malignancy in adults, and their detection is crucial for treatment planning. Post-contrast 3D T1 gradient-recalled echo (GRE) sequences are commonly used for this purpose, but contrast-enhanced 3D T1 turbo spin-echo (TSE) sequences with motion-sensitized driven-equilibrium (MSDE) technique (""black blood"") may offer improved detection. This study aimed to compare the effectiveness of contrast-enhanced 3D black blood sequences to standard 3D T1 GRE sequences in detecting brain metastases on a 1.5-T MRI. A retrospective analysis of 183 patients with suspected or follow-up brain metastases between May 2022 and September 2023 was conducted. Among these patients, 107 were included in the final analysis. Both post-contrast 3D T1 GRE and 3D black blood sequences were acquired on the same scanner with similar acquisition times. Two neuroradiologists independently evaluated the images for the number, size, and location of metastases. Interobserver variability and statistical analysis were performed. Among the 107 patients (mean age 60.8 years ± 13.2 years; 55 males, 52 females), 3D black blood sequences detected a significantly higher number of brain metastases, particularly small lesions (< 5 mm), compared to 3D T1 GRE sequences (p < 0.05). There was no significant difference in detecting large metastases (≥ 5 mm) between the sequences. In addition, the black blood sequences provided better conspicuity of metastases in the majority of patients (85%). Contrast-enhanced 3D T1 TSE with MSDE (""black blood"") sequences offer improved detection of brain metastases, especially small lesions, on 1.5-T MRI compared to standard 3D T1 GRE sequences. Question Accurate identification of the number and location of brain metastases using MRI is essential for planning and managing effective treatment. Findings Contrast-enhanced 3D T1 TSE black blood sequences detected significantly more small brain metastases than standard 3D T1 GRE sequences on 1.5-T MRI. Clinical relevance The use of 3D black blood sequences on 1.5-T MRI may have the potential to improve the accuracy of detection of brain metastases, leading to better treatment planning and potentially improved patient outcomes.",2243

Mesorectal nodal structures identified on baseline MRI as lymph nodes were anatomically compared to their corresponding structures histopathologically, reported as lymph nodes, tumour deposits or extramural venous invasion. All anatomically matched nodal structures from patients with primary surgery and all malignant nodal structures from patients with neoadjuvant treatment were included. Mixed-effects logistic regression models were used to evaluate the morphological criteria irregular margin, round shape, heterogeneous signal and nodal size, as well as the combined 2016 European Society of Gastrointestinal and Abdominal Radiology (ESGAR) consensus criteria, with histopathological nodal status as the gold standard. In total, 458 matched nodal structures were included from 46 patients (mean age, 67.7 years ± 1.5 [SD], 27 men), of which 19 received neoadjuvant treatment. The strongest associations in the univariable model were found for short-axis diameter ≥ 5 mm (OR 21.43; 95% CI: 4.13-111.29, p < 0.001) and heterogeneous signal (OR 9.02; 95% CI: 1.33-61.08, p = 0.024). Only size remained significant in multivariable analysis (OR 12.32; 95% CI: 2.03-74.57, p = 0.006). When applying the ESGAR consensus criteria to create a binary classification of nodal status, the OR of malignant outcome for nodes with positive ESGAR was 8.23 (95% CI: 2.15-31.50, p = 0.002), with corresponding sensitivity and specificity of 54% and 85%, respectively. The results confirm the role of morphological and size criteria in predicting lymph node metastases. However, the current criteria might not be accurate enough for nodal staging. Question Pretreatment lymph node staging in rectal cancer is challenging, and the ESGAR consensus criteria are not fully validated. Findings Although the ESGAR criteria correlated with malignant outcomes, diagnostic performance in terms of particular sensitivity, but also specificity, was not high. Clinical relevance Accurate nodal staging in rectal cancer is crucial for individual treatment planning. However, this validation of the current ESGAR consensus criteria suggests that these should be used with caution.",2258

39838090,Tumour growth rate and invasive interval cancer characteristics in a UK breast cancer screening population.,European radiology,2025,"To estimate tumour volume doubling time (TVDT) of interval cancers (ICs). Two radiologists retrospectively reviewed prior screening and diagnostic mammograms and measured mean diameter on ""visible"" ICs. Univariate analyses of clinicopathological variables (ER, HER2, grade, age at diagnosis, and breast density) were undertaken, and those with p < 0.1 were included in a generalised linear model to estimate TVDT, cancer size at screening, and time of cancer visibility for ""non-visible"" tumours. From 2011 to 2018, 476 ICs were diagnosed, almost half in the third year after screening with 86% grade 2 or 3. A visible abnormality at screening was identified in 281/476 (59%) cases. Significant differences in TVDT were found with age (p < 0.02), ER status (p < 0.0001). Median TVDTs of grade 1, 2 and 3 cancers were 317, 288, and 195 days, respectively (p < 0.001). For non-visible cancers, the median estimated size at screening was 1.7 mm (IQR 1.0-2.5) for grade 1, 2.5 mm (IQR 1.5-5.9) for grade 2, and 0.9 mm (IQR 0.4-2.0) for grade 3 cancers, p < 0.001. The estimated time for cancer visibility was 489 days (IQR 229-682) after screening and 645 days (IQR 527-798) for cancers diagnosed in the third year after screening. Using TVDT of retrospectively visible interval cancers, non-visible interval cancer sizes can be estimated at the time of screening. Increasing the frequency of screening from three-yearly to two-yearly invitations would reduce the number of interval cancers significantly. Question Growth modelling of visible interval cancers (ICs) at screening helps to track the likely progression of non-visible ICs over the screening interval. Findings Tumour doubling time of visible ICs at screening is positively associated with age and ER status and inversely associated with cancer grade. Clinical relevance Interval cancer characterisation and growth modelling can be helpful to better predict the benefits of supplemental screening and the frequency of screening, given a minimum detectable size.",2020
39838089,Serial assessment of coronary artery inflammation using cardiac CT in anthracycline chemotherapy for breast cancer.,European radiology,2025,"There is limited evidence of the pericoronary fat attenuation index (FAI) as an imaging marker to assess cancer therapy-related cardiovascular toxicity. We aimed to measure FAI in four consecutive coronary CT angiography (CTA) scans before and 3, 6, and 12 months after anthracycline treatment in patients with breast cancer to determine trends in dynamic changes in FAI after treatment. We performed a post hoc analysis of a prospective study (between August 2019 and July 2020) in which anthracycline-induced myocardial injury was evaluated using cardiac CT. FAI was quantified using coronary CTA images before and 3, 6, and 12 months after anthracycline treatment. The FAIs of the three coronary arteries were averaged to calculate the FAI (Total). FAI was analyzed on 14 patients with breast cancer who had adequate CT image quality (mean age, 62 years ± 11 (SD); 14 women). During the observation period, all 14 patients treated with anthracycline developed mild asymptomatic cardiac dysfunction related to cancer treatment (CTRCD). FAI (Total) showed a gradual increase during the observation period compared to baseline (baseline: -77.3 ± 5.6 HU, 3 months: -77.1 ± 4.8 HU, 6 months: -76.5 ± 5.4 HU, 12 months: -73.8 ± 5.8 HU). FAI (Total) was significantly elevated at 12 months compared to baseline (p < 0.001). In patients with breast cancer, FAI showed a gradual increase at 3, 6, and 12 months after treatment with anthracyclines compared to before treatment. FAI may be used as an imaging biomarker of coronary artery inflammation in the follow-up of anthracycline therapy and may contribute to the personalization of therapy through early detection of coronary toxicity. Question Is pericoronary fat attenuation index (FAI) a potential imaging biomarker for assessing changes in pericoronary adipose tissue related to cancer therapy-related cardiovascular toxicity? Findings In 14 patients with breast cancer, FAI showed a gradual increase at 3, 6, and 12 months after treatment with anthracyclines compared to before treatment.

39838088,Prognostic value of CT-based skeletal muscle and adipose tissue mass and quality parameters in patients with liver metastases and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma undergoing Yttrium-90 radioembolization.,European radiology,2025,"To investigate baseline patient characteristics associated with the risk of computed tomography (CT)-based sarcopenia and assess whether sarcopenia and other morphometric parameters influence survival outcomes in patients with liver metastases and cholangiocarcinoma after Yttrium-90 radioembolization. We retrospectively analyzed 120 cancer patients (mean age, 62 ± 13.3 years, 61 men) who underwent preprocedural CT. Skeletal muscle index (SMI) was measured at the L3 vertebral level to identify sarcopenia. The Cox proportional hazard model was performed to assess the prognostic value of the variables, and Kaplan-Meier analysis with log-rank text was used for overall survival (OS) assessment. Sarcopenia was diagnosed in 70 patients (58.3%). The multivariate regression analysis demonstrated that male sex, body mass index (BMI), visceral fat radiation attenuation (VFRA), skeletal muscle radiation attenuation (SMRA), and subcutaneous fat radiation attenuation (SFRA) were associated with the incidence of sarcopenia with the odds ratio of 8.81 (95% CI, 2.09-37.1, p = 0.003), 0.64 (95% CI, 0.48-0.85, p = 0.002), 1.23 (95% CI, 1.06-1.42, p = 0.006), 0.79 (95% CI, 0.69-0.91, p = 0.001) and 0.84 (95% CI, 0.76-0.93, p = 0.001), respectively. Age, skeletal muscle index, and tumor subtypes were independent prognostic factors for OS with the hazard ratio of 1.03 (95% CI, 1.01-1.05, p = 0.01), 0.92 (95% CI, 0.86-0.99, p = 0.021) and 2.09 (95% CI, 1.31-3.33 p = 0.002), respectively. In patients with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, median OS was significantly longer in the non-sarcopenic group than in the sarcopenic patient (25.9 versus 6.5 months, p = 0.029). Male sex, BMI, VFRA, SMRA, and SFRA were associated with the incidence of sarcopenia. SMI value could be used as a biomarker for OS in patients treated with Yttrium-90 radioembolization. Question The prognostic significance of CT-based sarcopenia and other morphometric parameters in patients with liver metastases and cholangiocarcinoma undergoing Yttrium-90 radioembolization remains unclear. Findings A high skeletal muscle index has been identified as an independent protective factor for overall survival in cancer patients treated with Yttrium-90 radioembolization. Clinical relevance The negative impact of CT-based sarcopenia has been confirmed in the context of Yttrium-90 radioembolization.

Patients who underwent MRI-guided ablation for DTs between February 2013 and April 2021 were included in this single-center IRB-approved retrospective study. MRI scans assessed three suspicious tissue features: intermediate T2 signal [+iT2], nodular appearance [+NOD], and contrast enhancement [+ENH]. Percent-monthly change in diameter (PMCD) of suspicious foci determined growth (PMCD > 1%), unchanged (PMCD between -1% and +1%), or regression (PMCD < -1%). Statistical tests compared mean PMCD between groups and evaluated sensitivity and specificity. Thirty-three patients (32 years ± 13.3; 22 females) with 34 DTs underwent 47 MRI-guided ablations, with a median follow-up of 269 days (IQR 147). Of 93 suspicious foci, 62 (67%) grew (PMCD: +5.6% IQR: 5.8), 13 (14%) remained unchanged (PMCD: -0.1% IQR: 0.6), and 18 (19%) regressed (PMCD: -3.9% IQR: 4.2). Features [+iT2], [+ENH], and [+NOD] were associated with PMCDs of +5.2% IQR: 6.0, +3.4% IQR: 6.0, and +3.4% IQR: 6.5, respectively, compared to -1.5% IQR: 4.7 (p < 0.0001), -0.5% IQR: 0.8 (p = 0.003), and +0.4% IQR: 7.5 (p = 0.0056) for their respective negative counterparts. Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for distinguishing growth were [+iT2]: 0.95, 0.71, 0.87, [+ENH]: 1.00, 0.32, 0.77, and [+NOD]: 0.84, 0.42, 0.70. Combining [+iT2 + NOD + ENH] yielded PMCD +5.9% IQR: 6.2 and the best performance for distinguishing growth (sensitivity 0.81, specificity 0.94, accuracy 0.85). MRI features reliably predict the growth of residual or recurrent DTs post-ablation, with [+iT2] being the most accurate. Adding nodular enhancement to [+iT2] improved specificity without sacrificing accuracy. Question Post-ablation imaging of desmoids is challenging due to tumor heterogeneity and treatment-related inflammation. This study evaluates MRI features for assessing future tumor growth. Findings Foci of intermediate T2 signal post-ablation predicted desmoid growth with high sensitivity (0.95), while T2 signal, nodularity, and enhancement combined offer high specificity (0.94). Clinical relevance Intermediate T2 signal predicts desmoid tumor growth post-ablation with high sensitivity and accuracy but moderate specificity. Combining nodularity and enhancement improves specificity and predictive value, helping clinicians in managing desmoid tumor patients post-ablation.",2453

This retrospective study included 1111 patients with solitary T1N0M0 PTC treated with RFA (n = 894) or MWA (n = 215) by experienced physicians. A propensity score matching was used to compare disease progression, including lymph node metastases (LNM), recurrent tumors and persistent tumors, recurrence-free survival (RFS), volume reduction ratio (VRR), and complications between the RFA and MWA groups. The subgroup outcomes of T1a and T1b tumors treated with RFA and MWA were also compared. During a mean follow-up period of 41.7 ± 12.6 months, the overall incidence rates of disease progression, LNM, recurrent tumors, and persistent tumors were 2.1%, 0.7%, 1.2%, and 0.2%, respectively. Eight patients (0.7%) experienced transient voice change and recovered within 3 months. After 1:1 matching, there were no significant differences in disease progression (3.3% vs. 3.7%, p = 0.793), LNM (1.4% vs. 1.9%, p = 1.000), recurrent tumor (1.4% vs. 1.9%, p = 1.000), persistent tumors (0.5% vs. 0%, p = 0.317), RFS rates (96.7% vs. 96.3%, p = 0.821), VRR (99.3 ± 3.0% vs. 98.3 ± 8.5%, p = 0.865), tumor disappearance rate (87.9% vs. 81.4%, p = 0.061) and complications (1.4% vs. 1.9%, p = 1.000) between the RFA and MWA groups. For T1a and T1b tumors, clinical outcomes were comparable between RFA and MWA. RFA and MWA did not show significant differences in clinical outcomes for T1N0M0 PTC.

A search was conducted on PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library databases, and Embase for studies evaluating the performance of MRI in assessing MTM-HCC. The quality assessment of diagnostic studies (QUADAS-2) tool was used to assess the risk of bias. Diagnostic accuracy measures, including sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio (PLR), negative likelihood ratio (NLR), and diagnostic odds ratio (DOR), were pooled. Summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC) curves with the area under the curve (AUC) were generated. Meta-regression analysis was performed to explore potential sources of heterogeneity. A total of ten eligible studies including 2074 lesions in 2053 patients were analyzed. The pooled sensitivity, specificity, PLR, NLR, DOR, and AUC were 0.65 (0.52, 0.76), 0.88 (0.80, 0.94), 5.6 (3.70, 8.60), 0.40 (0.30, 0.53), 14 (10, 20), and 0.84 (0.81, 0.87), respectively. High heterogeneity was observed (I MRI has diagnostic value for MTM-HCC due to its higher specificity and moderate sensitivity, but its clinical application remains suboptimal due to significant heterogeneity. Thus, further prospective studies with large sample sizes are needed to confirm these results. Question What is the value of MRI for preoperatively predicting MTM-HCC? Findings Meta-regression analyses revealed that the MRI method (radiomics or non-radiomics) is a significant factor contributing to heterogeneity.

39835978,How I Do It: Management of Pleural-attached Pulmonary Nodules in Low-Dose CT Screening for Lung Cancer.,Radiology,2025,"Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths globally. In various trials, the ability of low-dose CT screening to diagnose early lung cancers leads to high cure rates. It is widely accepted that the potential benefits of low-dose CT screening for lung cancer outweigh the harms. The ability to reliably predict the benignity of nodules, especially at the baseline round, further reduces the potential for harm. Pleural-attached nodules are an important subgroup that represents nodules attached (distance from any pleural surface, 0 mm) to any pleural surfaces (fissural, costal, mediastinal, and diaphragmatic). Pleural-attached solid nodules less than 10 mm in average diameter with smooth margins and triangular, lentiform, oval, or semicircular shapes have a high likelihood of benignity. The 2019 Lung CT Screening Reporting and Data System (Lung-RADS) version 1.1 assigned pleural-attached nodules with these features to categories 3 (probably benign, recommend follow-up in 6 months) or 4 (suspicious for malignancy, recommend follow-up in 3 months or PET/CT). However, Lung-RADS version 2022 now recommends annual follow-up rather than short-term follow-up. These changes downgrade these nodules to category 2 (benign) and limits additional workup. This review article summarizes the terminology used to describe these nodules, characteristics for determining benignity, and the accuracy of the evidence used to make these recommendations.",1452
39835977,"CT, MRI, and FDG PET/CT in the Assessment of Lymph Node Involvement in Pediatric Hodgkin Lymphoma: An Expert Consensus Definition by an International Collaboration on Staging Evaluation and Response Criteria Harmonization for Children, Adolescent, and Young Adult Hodgkin Lymphoma (SEARCH for CAYAHL).",Radiology,2025,"Staging of pediatric Hodgkin lymphoma is currently based on the Ann Arbor classification, incorporating the Cotswold modifications and the Lugano classification. The Cotswold modifications provide guidelines for the use of CT and MRI. The Lugano classification emphasizes the importance of CT and PET/CT in evaluating both Hodgkin lymphoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma but focuses on adult patients. This article presents consensus guidelines that extend the traditional classifications used for adult Hodgkin lymphoma staging and provide rigorous definitions of lymph node groups based on MRI, CT, and fluorodeoxyglucose PET/CT findings. This allows consistent terminology and definitions, using metabolic and morphologic imaging to identify affected lymph nodes or extranodal regions and organs. The pattern of involvement, together with other individual risk factors, determines treatment strategy. In case of inadequate response to chemotherapy, radiation therapy is often required. Standardization of staging definitions for pediatric Hodgkin lymphoma is necessary for comparing treatment outcomes between North American and European clinical trials and a prerequisite for clear communication during tumor boards and central review. This comprehensive imaging atlas is intended to provide regional criteria for nodal involvement and to serve as a standardized guide for the anatomic assignment of lymph node involvement in pediatric Hodgkin lymphoma.",1451
39835975,Contrast-enhanced US of High-Risk Indeterminate Focal Liver Observations Categorized as LR-4 or LR-M at CT/MRI.,Radiology,2025,"Background Indeterminate focal liver observations in patients at risk for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) may require invasive biopsy or follow-up, which could lead to delays in definitive categorization and to postponement of treatment. Purpose To examine clinical effect of contrast-enhanced US (CEUS) in participants with high-risk indeterminate liver observations categorized as Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System (LI-RADS) category LR-4 (probably HCC) or LI-RADS category LR-M (probably or definitely malignant but not HCC specific) at CT or MRI. Materials and Methods This was a secondary analysis of a prospective international multicenter validation study for CEUS LI-RADS (January 2018 to August 2021). CEUS was performed within 4 weeks of CT or MRI. Tissue histologic and CT or MRI follow-up data were used as reference standards. Clinical effect of CEUS for HCC was evaluated in observations 10 mm or larger categorized as CT/MRI LR-4 and LR-M. Results Included were 109 participants (mean age, 64.3 years ± 8.3 [SD]; 68.8% [75 of 109] male participants) with 113 observations (≥10 mm) categorized as CT/MRI LR-4 (53.1%; 60 of 113) or LR-M (46.9%; 53 of 113). CEUS resulted in management recommendation changes in 33.6% (95% CI: 25, 43; 38 of 113) of observations; among these, 95% (95% CI: 82, 99; 36 of 38) were correct. A total of 30.1% (34 of 113) of CT/MRI LR-4 and LR-M observations were categorized at CEUS as LI-RADS category LR-5 (definite HCC), making biopsy unnecessary; 94% (32 of 34) of these categorizations were correct. Of CT/MRI LR-4 observations, 7% (four of 60) were categorized as CEUS LR-M; subsequent biopsy confirmed non-HCC malignancy in all participants. Clinical impact of CEUS was more substantial for observations 20 mm or larger (",1774
39825171,Implementation of the 9th TNM for lung cancer: practical insights for radiologists.,European radiology,2025,"Lung cancer is the most common and deadly cancer worldwide. The 9th edition of the tumor node meta (TNM) classification system, effective from January 1, 2025, introduces significant updates. Notably, the N2 category is newly divided into N2a (single-station involvement) and N2b (multiple-station involvement), which reflects distinct prognostic implications. Additionally, the M1c category is now subcategorized into M1c1 (multiple metastases in a single organ system) and M1c2 (metastases in multiple organ systems), affecting stage classification. This reclassification allows for potential downstaging, which could expand treatment options for affected patients. Accurate imaging remains crucial for the classification of anatomical stages. As the TNM system evolves, enhanced imaging precision will play a key role in implementing these updates and ultimately improve patient outcomes. KEY POINTS: Question The 9th TNM for lung cancer introduces changes in the N2 and M1c descriptors, to better align with new therapeutic options and outcome studies. Findings Proper knowledge of the key changes of the 9th TNM can help radiologists offer clinicians a meaningful report. Clinical relevance Radiologists should incorporate the 9th TNM classification into their reports and discussions in multidisciplinary meetings, thus ensuring a common language across disciplines to enable clearer communication with other specialists, supporting more precise and cohesive decision-making in patient care.",1497
39808757,Randomized Comparison of Magnetic Resonance Imaging Versus Transurethral Resection for Staging New Bladder Cancers: Results From the Prospective BladderPath Trial.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,2025,"Transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) is the initial staging procedure for new bladder cancers (BCs). For muscle-invasive bladder cancers (MIBCs), TURBT may delay definitive treatment. We investigated whether definitive treatment can be expedited for MIBC using flexible cystoscopic biopsy and multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) for initial staging. We conducted a prospective open-label, randomized study conducted within 17 UK hospitals (registered as ISRCTN 35296862). Participants with suspected new BC were randomly assigned 1:1 to TURBT-staged or mpMRI-staged care, with minimization factors of sex, age, and clinician visual assessment of stage. Blinding was not possible. Patients unable/unwilling to undergo mpMRI or with previous BC were ineligible. The study had two stages with separate primary outcomes of feasibility and time to correct treatment (TTCT) for MIBC, respectively. Between May 31, 2018, and December 31, 2021, 638 patients were screened, and 143 participants randomly assigned to TURBT (n = 72; 55 males, 15 MIBCs) or initial mpMRI (n = 71; 53 males, 14 MIBCs). For feasibility, 36 of 39 (92% [95% CI, 79 to 98]) participants with suspected MIBC underwent mpMRI. The median TTCT for participants with MIBC was significantly shorter with initial mpMRI (n = 12, 53 days [95% CI, 20 to 89]  The mpMRI-directed pathway led to a 45-day reduction in TTCT for MIBC. Incorporating mpMRI ahead of TURBT into the standard pathway was beneficial for all patients with suspected MIBC.",1526

Purpose To compare simulated photon-counting CT (PCCT) with energy-integrating detector (EID) CT for the detection of small liver lesions. Materials and Methods In this reader study (July to December 2023), a virtual imaging framework was used with 50 anthropomorphic phantoms and 183 generated liver lesions (one to six lesions per phantom, 0.4-1.5 cm in diameter). Virtual CT platforms simulated PCCT and EID CT scanners. Phantoms were virtually scanned using routine (6 mGy) and low-dose (1.5 mGy) conditions and reconstructed with three kernels. A subset of 300 scans (150 PCCT vs EID CT pairs) were selected. Four radiologists independently reviewed all scans to mark liver lesions, assigned confidence scores for detection, and rated scan quality. Analysis was performed on a per-lesion basis to determine sensitivity for several variables and on a per-scan basis for scan quality. The McNemar test, two-sided paired ",1094
39807983,Deep Learning to Simulate Contrast-Enhanced MRI for Evaluating Suspected Prostate Cancer.,Radiology,2025,"Background Multiparametric MRI, including contrast-enhanced sequences, is recommended for evaluating suspected prostate cancer, but concerns have been raised regarding potential contrast agent accumulation and toxicity. Purpose To evaluate the feasibility of generating simulated contrast-enhanced MRI from noncontrast MRI sequences using deep learning and to explore their potential value for assessing clinically significant prostate cancer using Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) version 2.1. Materials and Methods Male patients with suspected prostate cancer who underwent multiparametric MRI were retrospectively included from three centers from April 2020 to April 2023. A deep learning model (pix2pix algorithm) was trained to synthesize contrast-enhanced MRI scans from four noncontrast MRI sequences (T1-weighted imaging, T2-weighted imaging, diffusion-weighted imaging, and apparent diffusion coefficient maps) and then tested on an internal and two external datasets. The reference standard for model training was the second postcontrast phase of the dynamic contrast-enhanced sequence. Similarity between simulated and acquired contrast-enhanced images was evaluated using the multiscale structural similarity index. Three radiologists independently scored T2-weighted and diffusion-weighted MRI with either simulated or acquired contrast-enhanced images using PI-RADS, version 2.1; agreement was assessed with Cohen κ.

39807982,CT Predictors of Angiolymphatic Invasion in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer 30 mm or Smaller.,Radiology,2025,"Background Angiolymphatic invasion (ALI) is an important prognostic indicator in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, few studies focus on radiologic features for predicting ALI in patients with early-stage NSCLCs 30 mm or smaller. Purpose To identify radiologic features for predicting ALI in NSCLCs 30 mm or smaller in maximum diameter. Materials and Methods This study was a secondary review of pathologic and CT findings from an integrated health care system between January 2016 and November 2023 for participants in the prospective study Initiative for Early Lung Cancer Research on Treatment, or IELCART. Preoperative diagnostic radiologic features possibly related to ALI, volume doubling time (VDT), and PET maximum standardized uptake value were evaluated. Multivariable logistic regression analysis, adjusted for sex, age, nodule size, and smoking status, was used to determine predictors of ALI. Model performance was analyzed with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Results Of 778 resected NSCLCs 30 mm or smaller (median patient age, 69 years [IQR, 63-76 years]; 458 female patients), 715 (92%) were solid, 41 (5%) were part-solid, and 22 (3%) were nonsolid. ALI was documented in 271 (35%) resected NSCLCs, all in solid NSCLCs, representing 37.9% (95% CI: 34.4, 41.5) of solid NSCLCs. None of the 63 subsolid NSCLCs had ALI (0% [95% CI: 0, 5.75]). For the 715 solid NSCLCs (median patient age, 69 years [IQR, 63-76 years]; 420 female patients), multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that lollipop sign (odds ratio [OR] = 4.12 [95% CI: 2.82, 6.04]; ",1614
39805236,Subgroups varying in risk and density highlight the potential for stratified breast cancer screening.,"European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",2025,"Most breast cancer screening programs rely only on demographic data without considering individual risk factors of the population, which might limit their effectiveness by over- and underscreening specific subgroups. Therefore, the aim of this study is to highlight health and economic disparities in outcomes from such a uniform screening strategy. With the microsimulation model MISCAN, we simulated outcomes of the Dutch screening program considering 16 subgroups varying by their 5-year breast cancer risk and breast density. All outcomes showed significant disparities across risk-density subgroups. Notably, women with extremely dense breasts showed a mortality reduction from the current screening of 16-17 % compared to 25-29 % in other groups. Absolute benefits (breast cancer deaths averted, and life-years gained) increased with risk and varied independently by density. The range of false-positive rates varied almost twofold across the span of subgroups and nearly a ninefold difference in the medical costs incurred with lifelong follow-up. These findings emphasize the potential for stratified screening strategies to improve equity in health outcomes and reduce the burden of breast cancer.",1206
39798006,Breast density assessment via quantitative sound-speed measurement using conventional ultrasound transducers.,European radiology,2025,"The aim is to assess the feasibility and accuracy of a novel quantitative ultrasound (US) method based on global speed-of-sound (g-SoS) measurement using conventional US machines, for breast density assessment in comparison to mammographic ACR (m-ACR) categories. In a prospective study, g-SoS was assessed in the upper-outer breast quadrant of 100 women, with 92 of them also having m-ACR assessed by two radiologists across the entire breast. For g-SoS, ultrasonic waves were transmitted from varying transducer locations and the image misalignments between these were then related analytically to breast SoS. To test reproducibility, two consecutive g-SoS acquisitions each were taken at two similar breast locations by the same operator. Measurements were found highly repeatable, with a mean absolute difference ± standard deviation of 3.16 ± 3.79 m/s. Multiple measurements were combined yielding a single g-SoS estimate per each patient, which strongly correlated to m-ACR categories (Spearman's = 0.773). The g-SoS values for categories A-D were 1459.6 ± 0.74, 1475.6 ± 15.92, 1515.6 ± 27.10, and 1545.7 ± 20.62, with all groups (except A-B) being significantly different from each other. Dense breasts (m-ACR C&D) were classified with 100% specificity at 78% sensitivity, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.931. Extremely dense breasts (m-ACR D) were classified with 100% sensitivity at 77.5% specificity (AUC = 0.906). Quantitative g-SoS measurement of the breast was shown feasible and repeatable using conventional US machines, with values correlating strongly with m-ACR assessments. Question Breast density is a strong predictor of risk for breast cancer, which frequently develops in dense tissue regions. Therefore, density assessment calls for refined non-ionizing methods. Findings Quantitative global speed-of-sound (g-SoS) measurement of the breast is shown to be feasible using conventional US machines, repeatable, and able to classify breast density with high accuracy. Clinical relevance Being effective in classifying dense breasts, where mammography has reduced sensitivity, g-SoS can help stratify patients for alternative modalities. Ideal day for mammography or MRI can be determined by monitoring g-SoS. Furthermore, g-SoS can be integrated into personalized risk assessment.",2310

Twenty-one experts, members of the female pelvis imaging ESUR subcommittee from 19 institutions, replied to 2 rounds of questionnaires regarding imaging techniques and structured reporting used for pre-treatment evaluation of OC patients. The results of the survey were presented to the other authors during the group's annual meeting. The lexicon was aligned with the Society of American Radiology (SAR)-ESUR lexicon; a first draft was circulated, and then comments and suggestions from the other authors were incorporated. Evaluation of disease extent at diagnosis should be performed by chest, abdominal, and pelvic CT. The radiological report should map the disease with specific mention of sites that may preclude optimal cytoreductive surgery. For suspected recurrence, CT and [ CT is the imaging modality of choice for preoperative evaluation and follow-up in OC patients. A structured radiological report, including specific mention of sites that may preclude optimal debulking, is of value for patient management. Question Guidelines were last published for ovarian cancer (OC) imaging in 2010; here, guidance on imaging techniques and reporting, incorporating advances in the field, are provided. Findings Structured reports should map out sites of disease, highlighting sites that limit cytoreduction. For suspected recurrence, CT and 18FDG PET-CT are options, and MRI can be considered. Clinical relevance Imaging evaluation of OC patients at initial diagnosis (mainly based on CT), using a structured report that considers surgical needs is valuable in treatment selection and planning.",1744

A total of 210 patients undergoing lung cancer screening underwent LDCT (mean ± SD, 0.81 ± 0.28 mSv) and ULDCT (0.17 ± 0.03 mSv) scans. ULDCT images were reconstructed with ASiR-V (ULDCT-ASiR-V) and post-processed using DLIR (ULDCT-DLIR). The quality of the three CT images was analyzed. Three radiologists detected and measured pulmonary nodules on all CT images, with LDCT results serving as references. Nodule conspicuity was assessed using a five-point Likert scale, followed by further statistical analyses. A total of 463 nodules were detected using LDCT. The image noise of ULDCT-DLIR decreased by 60% compared to that of ULDCT-ASiR-V and was lower than that of LDCT (p < 0.001). The subjective image quality scores for ULDCT-DLIR (4.4 [4.1, 4.6]) were also higher than those for ULDCT-ASiR-V (3.6 [3.1, 3.9]) (p < 0.001). The overall nodule detection rates for ULDCT-ASiR-V and ULDCT-DLIR were 82.1% (380/463) and 87.0% (403/463), respectively (p < 0.001). The percentage difference between diameters > 1 mm was 2.9% (ULDCT-ASiR-V vs. LDCT) and 0.5% (ULDCT-DLIR vs. LDCT) (p = 0.009). Scores of nodule imaging sharpness on ULDCT-DLIR (4.0 ± 0.68) were significantly higher than those on ULDCT-ASiR-V (3.2 ± 0.50) (p < 0.001). DLIR-based image domain improves image quality, nodule detection rate, nodule imaging sharpness, and nodule measurement accuracy of ASiR-V on ULDCT. Question Deep learning post-processing is simple and cheap compared with raw data processing, but its performance is not clear on ultralow-dose CT. Findings Deep learning post-processing enhanced image quality and improved the nodule detection rate and accuracy of nodule measurement of ultralow-dose CT. Clinical relevance Deep learning post-processing improves the practicability of ultralow-dose CT and makes it possible for patients with less radiation exposure during lung cancer screening.",2167
39786515,The Screening Tomosynthesis Trial with Advanced Reader Methods (STREAM): design and rationale of a population-based breast cancer screening trial.,European radiology,2025,"It is uncertain what the effects of introducing digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) in the Dutch breast cancer screening programme would be on detection, recall, and interval cancers (ICs), while reading times are expected to increase. Therefore, an investigation into the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of DBT screening while optimising reading is required. The Screening Tomosynthesis trial with advanced REAding Methods (STREAM) aims to include 17,275 women (age 50-72 years) eligible for breast cancer screening in the Netherlands for two biennial DBT screening rounds to determine the short-, medium-, and long-term effects and acceptability of DBT screening and identify an optimised strategy for reading DBT. The control group will consist of 86,400 women selected from the database of the Dutch breast cancer screening programme screened with digital mammography. The intervention group will undergo DBT examinations only. Four different reading strategies will be evaluated on a subset of first-round screening exams. These four strategies will also be evaluated combined with replacing one of the two readers with AI predictions. The Microsimulation Screening Analysis (MISCAN)-Breast model will be used to estimate the long-term outcomes of DBT screening assuming the best-performing reading method. The primary outcome measure is the IC and advanced cancer rate at the second round (combined endpoint) in the DBT group compared to the control group. Secondary outcome measures are participation, recall and detection rates, positive predictive value, acceptability, reading method with the best case-based area under the curve and reading time, predicted breast cancer mortality, number of cancers overdiagnosed, and cost-effectiveness. Question The short-, medium-, and long-term effects of digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) imaging in the Dutch breast cancer screening programme are unknown, but essential to decide about implementation. Findings This protocol paper describes the primary endpoint of the STREAM trial: the combined interval and advanced cancer detection rate at the second DBT round. Clinical relevance The STREAM trial is a prospective, non-randomised, population-based study in the Dutch breast cancer screening programme, that aims to evaluate the effects and acceptability of two rounds of DBT screening to determine if DBT can enhance the programme's outcomes.",2399
39775898,"Co-occurrence of bronchiectasis, airway wall thickening, and emphysema in Chinese low-dose CT screening.",European radiology,2025,"To assess the co-occurrence of incidental CT lung findings (emphysema, bronchiectasis, and airway wall thickening) as well as associated risk factors in low-dose CT (LDCT) lung cancer screening in a Chinese urban population. Data from 978 participants aged 40-74 years from the Chinese NELCIN-B3 urban population study who underwent LDCT screening were selected. CT scans were reviewed for incidental lung findings: emphysema, bronchiectasis and airway wall thickness. Emphysema was defined in three ways (≥ trace, ≥ mild, or ≥ moderate) depending on severity. Participants were described and stratified by presence or absence of incidental lung findings. Logistic regression analyses were performed to examine the relationship between participant characteristics and CT findings. Mean age was 61.3 years ± 6.8 and 533 (54.6%) were female. 48% of participants had incidental lung findings: 19.9% had emphysema (≥ mild), 9.2% had bronchiectasis, and 35.7% had airway wall thickening. Among 978 participants, 2.1% showed all three findings. Multivariable analysis showed that higher age (OR: 1.06; 95% CI: 1.04-1.08; p < 0.001), male sex (OR: 1.68; 95% CI: 1.14-2.47; p = 0.008) smoking history (OR: 1.76; 95% CI: 1.02-3.03; p = 0.04 for former smokers; OR: 2.45; 95% CI: 1.59-3.78; p < 0.001 for current smokers), and the presence of respiratory symptoms (OR: 1.42; 95% CI: 1.01-2.00; p = 0.04) were associated with the risk of having at least one incidental lung findings. When different definitions of emphysema were used, the results remained consistent. In a Chinese urban population undergoing LDCT lung cancer screening, 48% had at least one incidental CT lung finding, which was associated with higher age, male sex, questionnaire-based respiratory symptoms and smoking history. Question Reporting of incidental lung findings that indicate lung disease risk lacks consensus in the cancer screening setting and needs evidence of co-occurrence in general populations. Findings Almost half of the 978 participants had at least one incidental lung CT finding; these were associated with older age, male sex, respiratory symptoms, and smoking history. Clinical relevance Incidental lung findings and related risk factors are often observed in low-dose CT lung cancer screening, and careful consideration of their relevance should be given to their inclusion in future screenings.",2380
39775897,Characterization of hepatocellular carcinoma with CT with deep learning reconstruction compared with iterative reconstruction and 3-Tesla MRI.,European radiology,2025,"This study compared the characteristics of lesions suspicious for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and their LI-RADS classifications in adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction (ASIR) and deep learning reconstruction (DLR) to those of MR images, along with radiologist confidence. This prospective single-center trial included patients who underwent four-phase liver CT and multiphasic contrast-enhanced MRI within 7 days from February to August 2023. The lesion characteristics, LI-RADS classifications and confidence scores according to two radiologists on the ASIR, DLR and MRI techniques were compared. If the patient had at least one lesion, he was included in the HCC group, otherwise in the non-HCC group. MRI being the technique with the best sensitivity, concordance of lesions characteristics and LI-RADS classifications were calculated by weighted kappa between the ASIR and MRI and between the DLR and MRI. The confidence scores are expressed as the means and standard deviations. Eighty-nine patients were enrolled, 52 in the HCC group (67 years ± 9 [mean ± SD], 46 men) and 37 in the non-HCC group (68 years ± 9, 33 men). The concordance coefficient between the LI-RADS classification by ASIR and MRI was 0.64 [0.52; 0.76], showing good agreement, that by DLR and MRI was 0.83 [0.73; 0.92], showing excellent agreement. The diagnostic confidence in ASIR was 3.31 ± 0.95 (mean ± SD) and 3.0 ± 1.11, that in the DLR was 3.9 ± 0.88 and 4.11 ± 0.75, that in the MRI was 4.46 ± 0.80 and 4.57 ± 0.80. DLR provided excellent LI-RADS classification concordance with MRI, whereas ASIR provided good concordance. The radiologists' confidence was greater in the DLR than in the ASIR but remained highest in the MR group. Question Does the use of deep learning reconstructions (DLR) improve LI-RADS classification of suspicious hepatocellular carcinoma lesions compared to adaptive statistical iterative reconstructions (ASIR)? Findings DLR demonstrated superior concordance of LI-RADS classification with MRI compared to ASIR. It also provided greater diagnostic confidence than ASIR. Clinical relevance The use of DLR enhances radiologists' ability to visualize and characterize lesions suspected of being HCC, as well as their LI-RADS classification. Moreover, it also boosts their confidence in interpreting these images.",2330

39772798,"MRI of the Rectum: A Decade into DISTANCE, Moving to DISTANCED.",Radiology,2025,"Over the past decade, advancements in rectal cancer research have reshaped treatment paradigms. Historically, treatment for locally advanced rectal cancer has focused on neoadjuvant long-course chemoradiotherapy, followed by total mesorectal excision. Interest in organ preservation strategies has been strengthened by the introduction of total neoadjuvant therapy with improved rates of complete clinical response. The administration of systemic induction chemotherapy and consolidation chemoradiotherapy in the neoadjuvant setting has introduced a new dimension to the treatment landscape and patients now face a more intricate decision-making process, given the expanded therapeutic options. This complexity underlines the importance of shared decision-making and brings to light the crucial role of radiologists. MRI, especially high-spatial-resolution T2-weighted imaging, is heralded as the reference standard for rectal cancer management because of its exceptional ability to provide staging and prognostic insights. A key evolution in MRI interpretation for rectal cancer is the transition from the DISTANCE mnemonic to the more encompassing DISTANCED-DIS, distal tumor boundary; T, T stage; A, anal sphincter complex; N, nodal status; C, circumferential resection margin; E, extramural venous invasion; D, tumor deposits. This nuanced shift in the mnemonic captures a wider range of diagnostic indicators. It also emphasizes the escalating role of radiologists in steering well-informed decisions in the realm of rectal cancer care.",1541

American journal of roentgenology,2025,"Fertility-sparing treatment (FST) has become a key aspect of managing gynecologic cancers in reproductive-age patients who wish to preserve fertility. Several leading clinical societies, including the European Society of Gynecological Oncology, the European Society for Radiotherapy and Oncology, the European Society of Pathology, and the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology, have published evidence-based guidelines on fertility-sparing strategies and post-treatment surveillance of patients with early-stage gynecologic cancers, in particular endometrial and cervical cancers. These guidelines highlight MRI as essential to initial patient selection and follow-up. Properly tailored pelvic MRI protocols and clear MRI reports are key to performing accurate staging, assessing eligibility, and confirming the initial and ongoing feasibility of FST. Accordingly, radiologists, particularly those specializing in gynecologic imaging, play a critical role in the multidisciplinary approach to FST. They should be well-versed in FST eligibility criteria and key MRI findings before and after FST, ensuring these details are comprehensively communicated in structured MRI reports.",1195

AI can potentially reduce radiologist workload as first-read-filter by ruling-out negative cases. The feasibility of AI as first reader was evaluated in the European 4-IN-THE-LUNG-RUN (4ITLR) trial, comparing its negative-misclassifications (NMs) to those of radiologists and the impact on referral rates. NMs were collected from 3678 baseline LDCTs of the 4ITLR-dataset. LDCTs were read independently by radiologists and dedicated AI software (AVIEW-LCS, v1.1.42.92, Coreline-Soft, Seoul, Korea). A case was designated as NM when nodules > 100 mm Of the 3678 baseline scans, 438 NMs (11.9 %) were identified (age individuals: 68 (IQR: 64-73) years, 241 men); 31 (0.8 %) by AI and 407 (11.1 %) by radiologists. Among the 31 AI-NMs, 3 were classified positive and 28 indeterminate. Among the 407 radiologist-NMs, 4 were classified positive, and 403 were indeterminate, of which 8 were classified positive after receiving a three-month follow-up CT. Radiologists, as first reader, would have led to 12/102 (11.8 %) missed referrals, higher than the 3/102 (2.9 %) of AI. This study showed AI outperforms radiologists with significantly less NMs and therefore shows promise as first reader in a LCS program at baseline, by independently ruling-out negative cases without substantially increasing the risk of missed clinical referrals.",1446

We aimed to evaluate the performance of the lung-cancer-prediction-convolutional-neural-network (LCP-CNN), a deep learning-based approach, in comparison to multiparametric statistical methods (Brock model and Lung-RADS®) for risk classification of nodules in cohorts with different risk profiles and underlying pulmonary diseases. Retrospective analysis was conducted on non-contrast and contrast-enhanced CT scans containing pulmonary nodules measuring 5-30 mm. Ground truth was defined by histology or follow-up stability. The final analysis was performed on 297 patients with 422 eligible nodules, of which 105 nodules were malignant. Classification performance of the LCP-CNN, Brock model, and Lung-RADS® was evaluated in terms of diagnostic accuracy measurements including ROC-analysis for different subcohorts (total, screening, emphysema, and interstitial lung disease). LCP-CNN demonstrated superior performance compared to the Brock model in total and screening cohorts (AUC 0.92 (95% CI: 0.89-0.94) and 0.93 (95% CI: 0.89-0.96)). Superior sensitivity of LCP-CNN was demonstrated compared to the Brock model and Lung-RADS® in total, screening, and emphysema cohorts for a risk threshold of 5%. Superior sensitivity of LCP-CNN was also shown across all disease groups compared to the Brock model at a threshold of 65%, compared to Lung-RADS® sensitivity was better or equal. No significant differences in the performance of LCP-CNN were found between subcohorts. This study offers further evidence of the potential to integrate deep learning-based decision support systems into pulmonary nodule classification workflows, irrespective of the individual patient risk profile and underlying pulmonary disease. Question Is a deep-learning approach (LCP-CNN) superior to multiparametric models (Brock model, Lung-RADS®) in classifying pulmonary nodule risk across varied patient profiles? Findings LCP-CNN shows superior performance in risk classification of pulmonary nodules compared to multiparametric models with no significant impact on risk profiles and structural pulmonary diseases. Clinical relevance LCP-CNN offers efficiency and accuracy, addressing limitations of traditional models, such as variations in manual measurements or lack of patient data, while producing robust results. Such approaches may therefore impact clinical work by complementing or even replacing current approaches.",2549

39745682,Transplant and Nontransplant Salvage Therapy in Pediatric Relapsed or Refractory Hodgkin Lymphoma: The EuroNet-PHL-R1 Phase 3 Nonrandomized Clinical Trial.,JAMA oncology,2025,"The current standard-of-care salvage therapy in relapsed/refractory classic Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) includes consolidation high-dose chemotherapy (HDCT)/autologous stem cell transplant (aSCT). To investigate whether presalvage risk factors and fludeoxyglucose-18 (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) response to reinduction chemotherapy can guide escalation or de-escalation between HDCT/aSCT or transplant-free consolidation with radiotherapy to minimize toxic effects while maintaining high cure rates. EuroNet-PHL-R1 was a nonrandomized clinical trial that enrolled patients younger than 18 years with first relapsed/refractory cHL across 68 sites in 13 countries in Europe between January 2007 and January 2013. Data were analyzed between September 2022 and July 2024. Reinduction chemotherapy consisted of alternating IEP (ifosfamide, etoposide, prednisolone) and ABVD (adriamycin, bleomycin, vinblastine, dacarbazine). Patients with low-risk disease (late relapse after 2 cycles of first-line chemotherapy and any relapse with an adequate response after 1 IEP/ABVD defined as complete metabolic response on FDG-PET and at least 50% volume reduction) received a second IEP/ABVD cycle and radiotherapy (RT) to all sites involved at relapse. Patients with high-risk disease (all primary progressions and relapses with inadequate response after 1 IEP/ABVD cycle) received a second IEP/ABVD cycle plus HDCT/aSCT with or without RT. The primary end point was 5-year event-free survival. Secondary end points were overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). PFS was identical to event-free survival because no secondary cancers were observed. PFS data alone are presented for simplicity. Of 118 patients analyzed, 58 (49.2%) were female, and the median (IQR) age was 16.3 (14.5-17.6) years. The median (IQR) follow-up was 67.5 (58.5-77.0) months. The overall 5-year PFS was 71.3% (95% CI, 63.5%-80.1%), and OS was 82.7% (95% CI, 75.8%-90.1%). For patients in the low-risk group (n = 59), 41 received nontransplant salvage with a 5-year PFS of 89.7% (95% CI, 80.7%-99.8%) and OS of 97.4% (95% CI, 92.6%-100%). In contrast, 18 received HDCT/aSCT off protocol, with a 5-year PFS of 88.9% (95% CI, 75.5%-100%) and OS of 100%. All 59 patients with high-risk disease received HDCT/aSCT (and 23 received post-HDCT/aSCT RT) with a 5-year PFS of 53.3% (95% CI, 41.8%-67.9%) and OS of 66.5% (95% CI, 54.9%-80.5%). In this nonrandomized clinical trial, FDG-PET response-guided salvage in relapsed cHL may identify patients in whom transplant-free salvage achieves excellent outcomes. HDCT/aSCT may be reserved for primary progression and relapsed cHL with inadequate response. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00433459.",2726

A literature search was conducted from July 1st, 2019, to November 30th, 2023, to identify original investigations assessing MRI-based radiomics in the setting of PCa. Seven readers with varying expertise underwent a quality assessment using METRICS. Subgroup analyses were performed to assess whether the quality score varied according to papers' categories (diagnosis, staging, prognosis, technical) and quality ratings among these latter. From a total of 1106 records, 185 manuscripts were available. Overall, the average METRICS total score was 52% ± 16%. ANOVA and chi-square tests revealed no statistically significant differences between subgroups. Items with the lowest positive scores were adherence to guidelines/checklists (4.9%), handling of confounding factors (14.1%), external testing (15.1%), and the availability of data (15.7%), code (4.3%), and models (1.6%). Conversely, most studies clearly defined patient selection criteria (86.5%), employed a high-quality reference standard (89.2%), and utilized a well-described (85.9%) and clinically applicable (87%) imaging protocol as a radiomics data source. The quality of MRI-based radiomics research for PCa in recent studies demonstrated good homogeneity and overall moderate quality.

39738561,Diagnostic accuracy and inter-reader agreement of the nacVI-RADS for bladder cancer treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy: a prospective validation study.,European radiology,2025,"The primary aim was to determine the performance of neoadjuvant chemotherapy VI-RADS (nacVI-RADS) in predicting response to systemic therapy in patients with MIBC and to evaluate its inter-reader agreement. Prospective study, including patients with non-metastatic muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) who underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy before radical cystectomy (RC). Patients underwent pre- and post-treatment MRI. Radiological response was evaluated by two experienced radiologists using nacVI-RADS scoring system. Reference standard was defined using histopathological findings. Sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value (NPV), positive predictive value (PPV), and accuracy were calculated to assess nacVI-RADS performance for each reader. Inter-reader agreement was determined with Cohen's k statistics. Fifty-five patients with non-metastatic MIBC, 46 males (84%) and 9 females (16%) with a median age of 69 (interquartile range (IQR) 66-72 years) were enrolled. Diagnostic performance of nacVI-RADS in detecting complete response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy showed a sensitivity of 76.5-85.3% and specificity of 76.2-81%. The area under the curve was 0.93 (95% CI: 0.86-0.99) for detecting any residual tissue, for the more experienced reader. Inter-reader agreement was optimal with a K of 0.85. In the multivariable logistic regression model, the variables showing independent correlation with response prediction to neoadjuvant therapy were nacVI-RADS score (p = 0.01 for the more experienced reader) and tumor regression grade (TRG; p < 0.001). NacVI-RADS scoring system offers a reliable and reproducible approach, employing a well-structured and easily interpretable method, to assess the response to systemic therapy in patients with MIBC. Question There is a lack of a standardized approach to distinguish between responders and non-responders to neoadjuvant chemotherapy for muscle-invasive bladder cancer. Findings The neoadjuvant chemotherapy VI-RADS (nacVI-RADS) score diagnostic performance for detecting complete response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy showed 85.3% sensitivity, 81% specificity, and an AUC of 0.93.

39729110,Spectral CT-based nomogram for evaluation of neoadjuvant chemotherapy response in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.,European radiology,2025,"To establish a spectral CT-based nomogram for predicting the response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in patients with locally advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). This retrospective study included 172 patients with ESCC who underwent spectral CT scans before NAC followed by resection. Based on postoperative tumor regression grades (TRG), 34% (58) of patients were responsive (TRG1) and 66% (114) were non-responsive (TRG2-3). The data was divided into a primary set of 120 and a validation set of 52, maintaining a 7:3 random ratio. Measurements included iodine concentration (IC), normalized iodine concentration (nIC), CT Multivariable logistic regression analysis identified the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), clinical stage, ZeffVP, and nICVP as independent predictors of NAC response. The nomogram incorporating all four independent predictors, outperformed spectral CT and the clinical model with the highest AUCs of 0.825 (95% CI: 0.746-0.895) for the primary set and 0.794 (95% CI: 0.635-0.918) for the validation set (DeLong test: all p < 0.05). The spectral CT and clinical models were useful in predicting NAC response in ESCC patients. Combining spectral CT imaging parameters and clinicopathologic characteristics in a nomogram improved predictive accuracy. Question Developing a non-invasive, practical tool to predict ESCC's response to chemotherapy is crucial and has not yet been done. Findings This nomogram, incorporating clinicopathologic characteristics and spectral CT-derived parameters, predicted NAC response in ESCC patients. Clinical relevance This spectral CT-based nomogram is a non-invasive and easily obtainable tool for accurately predicting ESCC response to NAC, aiding clinicians in personalized treatment planning.",1776

Purpose To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy and reproducibility of neoadjuvant chemotherapy Vesical Imaging Reporting and Data System (nacVI-RADS) scores and posttreatment Vesical Imaging Reporting and Data System (VI-RADS) scores when assessing MIBC response to neoadjuvant immunotherapy with multiparametric MRI (mpMRI). Materials and Methods A retrospective analysis of MRI scans was conducted in patients enrolled in the PURE-01 study (NCT02736266) from February 2017 to December 2019 who underwent pre- and postimmunotherapy mpMRI before radical cystectomy. Five readers independently reviewed the scans using VI-RADS and nacVI-RADS criteria. Diagnostic accuracy was evaluated for each reader, and the final histopathologic diagnosis served as the reference standard. Interreader agreement was assessed with the percentage of agreement, Conger κ, and Gwet agreement coefficient AC1. Results A total of 110 patients (median age, 67 years [IQR: 61-74]; 96 male) with 220 MRI scans were included; 80 (73%) patients had pure urothelial carcinoma. A total of 46 of 110 (42%) patients achieved a complete pathologic response. The sensitivity, specificity, and negative predictive value of nacVI-RADS 3 or higher for detecting residual disease (higher than stage ypT0) at radical cystectomy were 67%-84%, 63%-96%, and 63%-75%, respectively; for residual muscle-invasive disease (higher than stage ypT1), these values were 91%-98%, 55%-94%, and 93%-98%, respectively. The accuracy of nacVI-RADS was 72%-81% for stage ypT0 or higher disease and 71%-95% for stage ypT1 or higher disease. The accuracy of VI-RADS 3 or higher was 80%-95% for stage ypT1 or higher disease. The percentage of agreement for nacVI-RADS scores was 82% (κ = 0.62-0.65; AC1 = 0.65).

39718496,CT- and MRI-based Factors Associated with Rapid Growth in Early-Stage Hepatocellular Carcinoma.,Radiology,2024,"Background Prediction of the tumor growth rates is clinically important in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but previous studies have presented conflicting results and generally lacked radiologic evaluations. Purpose To evaluate the percentage of rapidly growing early-stage HCCs in each Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System (LI-RADS) category and to identify prognostic factors associated with rapid growth. Materials and Methods Retrospective study of patients with risk factors for HCC and those with surgically proven early-stage HCC who underwent two or more preoperative multiphasic CT or MRI examinations between January 2016 and December 2020. LI-RADS categories were assigned according to the baseline CT or MRI results. The tumor volume doubling time (TVDT) was calculated from the tumor volumes measured at the two examinations. The growth rate was classified as rapid (TVDT < 3 months), intermediate (TVDT = 3-9 months), or indolent (TVDT > 9 months). The percentage of rapidly growing HCCs was compared among the LI-RADS categories, and multivariable logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with rapidly growing HCC. Results In 322 patients (mean age, 61 years ± 9 [SD]; 249 men) with 345 HCCs (30 LR-3, 64 LR-4, 221 LR-5, and 30 LR-M category), the median TVDT of HCC was 131 days (IQR, 87-233) and 27.0% of HCCs showed rapid growth.

39708083,Interhospital variations in diagnostic work-up following recall at biennial screening mammography-a population-based study.,European radiology,2025,"Quality control in breast cancer screening programmes has been subject of several studies. However, less is known about the clinical diagnostic work-up in recalled women with a suspicious finding at screening mammography. The current study focuses on interhospital differences in diagnostic work-up strategies. In this retrospective analysis, using a prospectively obtained database, we included 17,809 women who participated in the Dutch national screening programme between 2009 and 2019 and were recalled to a hospital for analysis of a suspicious mammographic abnormality. The diagnostic work-up (e.g., type and frequency of additional imaging and biopsy) in the different hospitals were compared and analysed by multivariable analysis to correct for confounders. Use of biopsy varied from 36.7% to 48.7% (p < 0.001) between hospitals, and the use of problem-solving magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) from 2.1% to 6.9% (p < 0.001). These interhospital differences remained after correction for patients and tumour characteristics. The percentage of women with a delayed breast cancer diagnosis, defined as histopathological confirmation of breast cancer more than three months after recall or first analysis in the hospital, varied from 2.7% to 6.1% between hospitals (p = 0.07). In our screening region interhospital differences were observed in diagnostic work-up following recall at biennial screening mammography. Though statistically significant, absolute differences were small, and therefore, their clinical impact appears to be limited. Question It is unclear how diagnostic work-up strategies vary between hospitals for women recalled after suspicious findings in breast cancer screening. Findings Significant differences in biopsy techniques and the use of problem-solving MRI were observed, though the clinical impact of these variations is likely to be marginal. Clinical relevance Evaluation of interhospital variation in the diagnostic work-up strategies after recall may aid in optimising the quality of breast cancer care and, indirectly, the effectiveness of the screening programme.",2103
39706924,Incidental pancreatic cystic lesions: retrospective analysis of natural history and efficacy of imaging surveillance guidelines.,European radiology,2025,"To assess the natural history of incidental pancreatic cystic lesions (PCLs) and the sensitivity of surveillance guidelines to detect malignancy. We performed a single-center retrospective analysis of incidental PCLs discovered between 2012 and 2017. Patients were identified by searching radiology reports for relevant keywords, then search results were manually reviewed to exclude patients with < 5 years of follow-up, non-incidental PCLs, known pancreatic cancer, or pancreatitis. Baseline and follow-up imaging was reviewed to record size, growth (as defined by the American College of Radiology (ACR)), high-risk stigmata, and incidence of malignancy. Four major guidelines (International Consensus, European, ACR, and Canadian Association of Radiologists (CAR)) were retrospectively applied to assess sensitivity to detect invasive disease. Benign and malignant PCL outcomes were compared (Fisher's exact test), and PCL growth was modeled (mixed-effects regression). Four hundred and forty-nine patients (67 ± 12 years, 284 women) with 556 PCLs were included. PCL natural growth was 0.33 mm/year (0.26-0.40 mm 95% CI), which overlaps with significant growth thresholds for ACR and CAR guidelines. Nine patients over 21,996 patient-years of follow-up developed pancreatic cancer (4.1 cases/10,000 patient-years). Malignancy was not associated with significant growth (4/9 vs 107/547, p = 0.084) but was with high-risk stigmata (3/9 vs 3/547, p < 0.001). Guideline sensitivities ranged from 33.3 to 66.7% (2-4/6 cases). PCLs are common, overwhelmingly benign, and grow slowly. Development of high-risk stigmata is associated with malignancy but not ""significant growth,"" which can overlap with natural PCL growth. Despite differences in recommended duration and frequency of follow-up, surveillance guidelines still miss 1/3-2/3 of cancers. Question There is limited evidence on the natural growth and malignant potential of incidental pancreatic cystic lesions. Findings Incidental pancreatic cystic lesions grew slowly (0.3 mm/year) and were uncommonly malignant (2%). Retrospective application of surveillance guidelines missed 1/3-2/3 of cancers. Clinical relevance Radiologists and imaging surveillance guidelines should account for the natural growth of incidental pancreatic cystic lesions. Given the low rate of malignancy, high proportion of missed cancers, and risk of overtreatment, the effectiveness of imaging surveillance guidelines remains unclear.",2468
39706923,Identifying threshold of CT-defined muscle loss after radiotherapy for survival in oral cavity cancer using machine learning.,European radiology,2025,"Muscle loss after radiotherapy is associated with poorer survival in patients with oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (OCSCC). However, the threshold of muscle loss remains unclear. This study aimed to utilize explainable artificial intelligence to identify the threshold of muscle loss associated with survival in OCSCC. We enrolled 1087 patients with OCSCC treated with surgery and adjuvant radiotherapy at two tertiary centers (660 in the derivation cohort and 427 in the external validation cohort). Skeletal muscle index (SMI) was measured using pre- and post-radiotherapy computed tomography (CT) at the C3 vertebral level. Random forest (RF), eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and Categorical Boosting (CatBoost) models were developed to predict all-cause mortality, and their performances were evaluated using the area under the curve (AUC). Muscle loss threshold was identified using the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method and validated using Cox regression analysis. In the external validation cohort, the RF, XGBoost, and CatBoost models achieved favorable performance in predicting all-cause mortality (AUC: 0.898, 0.859, and 0.842). The SHAP method demonstrated that SMI change after radiotherapy was the most important feature for predicting all-cause mortality and consistently identified SMI loss ≥ 4.2% as the threshold in all three models. In multivariable analysis, SMI loss ≥ 4.2% was independently associated with increased all-cause mortality risk in both cohorts (derivation cohort: hazard ratio: 6.66, p < 0.001; external validation cohort: hazard ratio: 8.46, p < 0.001). This study can assist clinicians in identifying patients with considerable muscle loss after treatment and guide interventions to improve muscle mass. Question Muscle loss after radiotherapy is associated with poorer survival in patients with oral cavity cancer; however, the threshold of muscle loss remains unclear. Findings Explainable artificial intelligence identified muscle loss ≥ 4.2% as the threshold of increased all-cause mortality risk in both derivation and external validation cohorts. Clinical Relevance Muscle loss ≥ 4.2% may be the optimal threshold for survival in patients who receive adjuvant radiotherapy for oral cavity cancer. This threshold can guide clinicians in improving muscle mass after radiotherapy.",2340
39706922,CT-based clinical-radiomics model to predict progression and drive clinical applicability in locally advanced head and neck cancer.,European radiology,2025,"Definitive chemoradiation is the primary treatment for locally advanced head and neck carcinoma (LAHNSCC). Optimising outcome predictions requires validated biomarkers, since TNM8 and HPV could have limitations. Radiomics may enhance risk stratification. This single-centre observational study collected clinical data and baseline CT scans from 171 LAHNSCC patients treated with chemoradiation. The dataset was divided into training (80%) and test (20%) sets, with a 5-fold cross-validation on the training set. Researchers extracted 108 radiomics features from each primary tumour and applied survival analysis and classification models to predict progression-free survival (PFS) and 5-year progression, respectively. Performance was evaluated using inverse probability of censoring weights and c-index for the PFS model and AUC, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for the 5-year progression model. Feature importance was measured by the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method and patient stratification was assessed through Kaplan-Meier curves. The final dataset included 171 LAHNSCC patients, with 53% experiencing disease progression at 5 years. The random survival forest model best predicted PFS, with an AUC of 0.64 and CI of 0.66 on the test set, highlighting 4 radiomics features and TNM8 as significant contributors. It successfully stratified patients into low and high-risk groups (log-rank p < 0.005). The extreme gradient boosting model most effectively predicted a 5-year progression, incorporating 12 radiomics features and four clinical variables, achieving an AUC of 0.74, sensitivity of 0.53, specificity of 0.81, and accuracy of 0.66 on the test set. The combined clinical-radiomics model improved the standard TNM8 and clinical variables in predicting 5-year progression though further validation is necessary. Question There is an unmet need for non-invasive biomarkers to guide treatment in locally advanced head and neck cancer. Findings Clinical data (TNM8 staging, primary tumour site, age, and smoking) plus radiomics improved 5-year progression prediction compared with the clinical comprehensive model or TNM staging alone. Clinical relevance SHAP simplifies complex machine learning radiomics models for clinicians by using easy-to-understand graphical representations, promoting explainability.",2334
39706921,Cancers not detected in one-view breast tomosynthesis screening-characteristics and reasons for non-detection.,European radiology,2025,"Limited understanding exists regarding non-detected cancers in digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) screening. This study aims to classify non-detected cancers into true or false negatives, compare them with true positives, and analyze reasons for non-detection. Conducted between 2010 and 2015, the prospective single-center Malmö Breast Tomosynthesis Screening Trial (MBTST) compared one-view DBT and two-view digital mammography (DM). Cancers not detected by DBT, i.e., interval cancers, those detected in the next screening round, and those only identified by DM, underwent a retrospective informed review by in total four breast radiologists. Reviewers classified cancers into true negative, false negative, or non-visible based on both DBT and DM findings and assessed radiographic appearances at screening and diagnosis, breast density, and reasons for non-detection. Statistics included the Pearson X In total, 89 cancers were not detected with DBT in the MBTST; eight cancers were solely in the DM reading mode, 59 during subsequent DM screening rounds, and 22 interval cancers. The proportion of cancers classified as false negative was 25% (22/89) based on DBT, compared with 18% (14/81) based on DM screening. The primary reason for false negatives was normal-appearing density, 50% (11/22). False negatives exhibited lower rates of high breast density, 36% (8/22), compared with true positives, 61% (78/129), p = 0.04, and spiculated densities were less frequent in false negatives, 41% (9/22) compared with true positives, 68% (88/129), p = 0.01. False negatives in one-view DBT screening commonly presented with spiculated features, but less frequently than true positives, and were missed or misinterpreted due to benign appearances. Question Cancers not detected in digital breast tomosynthesis screening, including false negatives, remain partly unexplored. Findings The most common reason behind false-negative cancers in a large screening trial was a normal-appearing density. Clinical relevance Recognizing the factors contributing to false negative findings in digital breast tomosynthesis screening is essential to further improve cancer detection.",2169
39704802,Coronary calcium score and emphysema extent on different CT radiation dose protocols in lung cancer screening.,European radiology,2025,"To assess the consistency of automated measurements of coronary artery calcification (CAC) burden and emphysema extent on computed tomography (CT) images acquired with different radiation dose protocols in a lung cancer screening (LCS) population. The patient cohort comprised 361 consecutive screenees who underwent a low-dose CT (LDCT) scan and an ultra-low-dose CT (ULDCT) scan at an incident screening round. Exclusion criteria for CAC measurements were software failure and previous history of CVD, including coronary stenting, whereas for emphysema assessment, software failure only. CT images were retrospectively analyzed by a fully automated AI software for CAC scoring, using three predefined Agatston score categories (0-99, 100-399, and ≥ 400), and emphysema quantification, using the percentage of low attenuation areas (%LAA). Demographic and clinical data were obtained from the written questionnaire completed by each participant at the first visit. Agreement for CAC and %LAA categories was measured by the k-Cohen Index with Fleiss-Cohen weights (K An overlap of CAC strata was observed in 275/327 (84%) volunteers, with an almost perfect agreement (K Automated CAC quantification on ULDCT seems feasible, showing similar results to those obtained on LDCT, while the quantification of emphysema tended to be overestimated on ULDCT images. Question Evidence demonstrating that coronary artery calcification and emphysema can be automatedly quantified on ultra-low-dose chest CT is still awaited. Findings Coronary artery calcification and emphysema measurements were similar among different CT radiation dose protocols; their automated quantification is feasible on ultra-low-dose CT. Clinical relevance Ultra-low-dose CT-based LCS might offer an opportunity to improve the secondary prevention of cardiovascular and respiratory diseases through automated quantification of both CAC burden and emphysema extent.",1928
39704801,Prognostic performance of the N category in the 9th edition of lung cancer staging.,European radiology,2025,"To compare the prognostic performance of the N category of lung cancer in the 9th edition with previous editions (7th edition and 8th edition's proposal). Patients who underwent lobectomy or pneumonectomy for lung cancer from January 2015 to December 2021 were retrospectively analyzed. Clinical and pathologic N categories were reclassified according to the 9th edition (N0, N1, N2a, and N2b), the 8th edition's proposal (N0, N1a, N1b, N2a1, N2a2, and N2b), and the 7th edition (N0, N1, and N2). Concordance index (C-index) and calibration were assessed for each edition. A total of 3864 patients were included (962 pN positive and 513 cN positive). The 9th edition demonstrated clear hazard stratification between neighboring pN categories after multivariable adjustment, whereas multiple overlaps were observed in the 8th edition's proposal. It had superior discrimination performance compared with the 7th edition in pathologic staging (all p < 0.05). Compared with the 8th edition's proposal, the 9th edition showed comparable performance in pN2 and overall patients (C-index, 0.560 vs 0.569 [p = 0.163]; 0.666 vs 0.668 [p = 0.396]), In clinical staging, there was no difference in discrimination across 7th to 9th editions (all p > 0.05). N1 dichotomization in the 8th edition's proposal showed discrimination ability (C-index, 0.539 [95% confidence interval: 0.502-0.576]) only in pathologic staging. The calibration was acceptable across the clinical 7th to 9th editions for 5-year survival. The revision of the N category in the 9th edition appears reasonable, offering enhanced prognostic discrimination compared with the 7th edition and comparability to the 8th edition's proposal. Question Does the revised N category in the 9th edition offer added value in discrimination over previous editions? Findings The discrimination performance of the 9th edition is comparable to that of the 8th edition's proposal, demonstrating a distinct hazard stratification between neighboring pN categories. Clinical relevance The revision of the N category in the 9th edition appears reasonable; however, survival heterogeneity within the pathologic N1 category needs to be considered in future updates.",2199
39702639,MRI-based prediction of microvascular invasion/high tumor grade and adjuvant therapy benefit for solitary HCC ≤ 5 cm: a multicenter cohort study.,European radiology,2025,"To develop and externally validate an MRI-based diagnostic model for microvascular invasion (MVI) or Edmondson-Steiner G3/4 (i.e., high-risk histopathology) in solitary BCLC 0/A hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) ≤ 5 cm and to assess its performance in predicting adjuvant therapy benefits. This multicenter retrospective cohort study included 577 consecutive adult patients who underwent contrast-enhanced MRI and subsequent curative resection or ablation for solitary BCLC 0/A HCC ≤ 5 cm (December 2011 to January 2024) from four hospitals. For resection-treated patients, a diagnostic model integrating clinical and 50 semantic MRI features was developed against pathology with logistic regression analyses on the training set (center 1) and externally validated on the testing dataset (centers 2-4), with its utilities in predicting posttreatment recurrence-free survival (RFS) and adjuvant therapy benefit evaluated by Cox regression analyses. Serum α-fetoprotein > 100 ng/mL (odds ratio (OR), 1.94; p = 0.006), non-simple nodular growth subtype (OR, 1.69; p = 0.03), and the VICT2 trait (OR, 4.49; p < 0.001) were included in the MVI or high-grade (MHG) trait, with testing set AUC, sensitivity, and specificity of 0.832, 74.0%, and 82.5%, respectively. In the multivariable Cox analysis, the MHG-positive status was associated with worse RFS (resection testing set HR, 3.55, p = 0.02; ablation HR, 3.45, p < 0.001), and adjuvant therapy was associated with improved RFS only for the MHG-positive patients (resection HR, 0.39, p < 0.001; ablation HR, 0.30, p = 0.005). The MHG trait effectively predicted high-risk histopathology, RFS and adjuvant therapy benefit among patients receiving curative resection or ablation for solitary BCLC 0/A HCC ≤ 5 cm. Question Despite being associated with increased recurrence and potential benefit from adjuvancy in HCC, microvascular invasion or Edmondson-Steiner grade 3/4 are hardly assessable noninvasively. Findings We developed and externally validated an MRI-based model for predicting high-risk histopathology, post-resection/ablation recurrence-free survival, and adjuvant therapy benefit in solitary HCC ≤ 5 cm. Clinical relevance Among patients receiving curative-intent resection or ablation for solitary HCC ≤ 5 cm, noninvasive identification of high-risk histopathology (MVI or high-grade) using our proposed MRI model may help improve individualized prognostication and patient selection for adjuvant therapies.",2466
39702637,Deep learning-based intratumoral and peritumoral features for differentiating ocular adnexal lymphoma and idiopathic orbital inflammation.,European radiology,2025,"To evaluate the value of deep-learning-based intratumoral and peritumoral features for differentiating ocular adnexal lymphoma (OAL) and idiopathic orbital inflammation (IOI). Nighty-seven patients with histopathologically confirmed OAL (n = 43) and IOI (n = 54) were randomly divided into training (n = 79) and test (n = 18) groups. DL-based intratumoral and peritumoral features were extracted to characterize the differences in heterogeneity and tissue invasion between different lesions, respectively. Subsequently, an attention-based fusion model was employed to fuse the features extracted from intra- and peritumoral regions and multiple MR sequences. A comprehensive comparison was conducted among different methods for extracting intratumoral, peritumoral, and fused features. Area under the curve (AUC) was used to evaluate the performance under a 10-fold cross-validation and independent test. Chi-square and student's t-test were used to compare discrete and continuous variables, respectively. Fused intra-peritumoral features achieved AUC values of 0.870-0.930 and 0.849-0.924 on individual MR sequences in the validation and test sets, respectively. This was significantly higher than those using intratumoral features (p < 0.05), but not significantly different than those using peritumoral features (p > 0.05). By combining multiple MR sequences, AUC values of the intra-peritumoral features were boosted to 0.943 and 0.940, higher than those obtained from each sequence alone. Moreover, intra-peritumoral features yielded higher AUC values compared to entire orbital cone features extracted by either the intra- or the peritumoral DL model, although no significant difference was found from the latter (p > 0.05). DL-based intratumoral, peritumoral, and especially fused intra-peritumoral features may help differentiate between OAL and IOI. Question What is the diagnostic value of the peritumoral region and its combination with the intratumoral region for radiomic analysis of orbital lymphoproliferative disorders? Findings Fused intra- and peritumoral features achieved significantly higher performance than intratumoral features, but had no significant difference to the peritumoral features. Clinical relevance Peritumoral contextual features, which characterize the invasion patterns of orbital lesions within the surrounding areas of the entire orbital cone, might serve as an independent imaging marker for differentiating between OAL and IOI.",2471
39702632,Prognostic value of early response in predicting survival in hepatocellular carcinoma patients treated with selective internal radiation therapy.,European radiology,2025,"This study evaluates the prognostic value of tumor response on CT at 3 months, assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), modified RECIST (mRECIST), and Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System Treatment Response Algorithm (LR-TRA) in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treated with selective internal radiation therapy (SIRT). A retrospective analysis was conducted on 102 HCC patients treated with SIRT between 2018 and 2020. RECIST, mRECIST, and LR-TRA were assessed at 3 months post-SIRT. Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were assessed using Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox proportional-hazards models. The median age was 71 years, and most patients (90%) had advanced-stage tumors (Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer-C). After a median follow-up of 32.0 months (95% CI: 16.8-60.9), 60/102 patients died (59%), and 90/102 patients showed tumor progression (88%). Median OS was 20.4 months (95% CI: 15.4-33.0), and median PFS was 14.5 months (95% CI: 6.5-24.5); 1-year OS and PFS rates were 65.6% and 50.7%. Multivariable analysis revealed that early response according to RECIST 1.1 (HR 1.66, p = 0.30), mRECIST (HR 1.40, p = 0.215), and LR-TRA (HR 0.67, p = 0.30) were not predictors of OS. Disease progression evaluated by RECIST (HR 2.55, p < 0.001) and mRECIST (HR 2.53, p < 0.001), bilirubin levels (HR 1.03, p < 0.001), and prothrombin time (HR 0.98, p = 0.005) were predictors of OS. For PFS, neither RECIST nor mRECIST response, disease progression, nor LR-TRA viability were predictors. In this advanced-stage HCC population, early response assessed by RECIST, mRECIST, and LR-TRA criteria did not predict OS or PFS after SIRT. However, early disease progression and liver function indicators were prognostic factors for OS. QuestionHow well does early tumor response, assessed at 3 months post-selective internal radiation therapy (SIRT), predict survival in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients? Findings Early response, assessed by RECIST, mRECIST, and LR-TRA, did not predict overall or progression-free survival; disease progression and liver function indicators were significant predictors. Clinical relevance This study highlights the limitations of early imaging criteria in predicting survival outcomes in advanced HCC post-SIRT, suggesting the need for alternative or complementary prognostic indicators to guide treatment decisions.",2419

We conducted a systematic review until March 2023. A random-effects meta-analysis was performed to combine the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) values. Publication bias was assessed using Egger's test and heterogeneity was estimated by I MRI-radiomics has emerged as a potential method for predicting the response to NAT in BC patients, showing promising outcomes. Nevertheless, it is important to acknowledge the diversity among the methodological choices applied. Further investigations should prioritize achieving standardized protocols, and enhancing methodological rigor in MRI-radiomics. Question Do methodological aspects influence the performance of MRI-radiomic models in predicting response to NAT in BC patients? Findings Radiomic model accuracy was influenced by the scanner vendor and feature type. Clinical relevance Methodological discrepancies affect the performance of MRI-radiomic models. Developing standardized protocols and enhancing methodological rigor in these studies should be prioritized.",1225
39700658,European consensus-based interdisciplinary guideline for melanoma. Part 1: Diagnostics - Update 2024.,"European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",2025,"This guideline was developed in close collaboration with multidisciplinary experts from the European Association of Dermato-Oncology (EADO), the European Dermatology Forum (EDF) and the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC). Recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of melanoma were developed on the basis of systematic literature research and consensus conferences. Cutaneous melanoma (CM) is the most dangerous form of skin tumor and accounts for 90 % of skin cancer mortality. The diagnosis of melanoma can be made clinically and must always be confirmed by dermoscopy. If melanoma is suspected, a histopathological examination is always required. Sequential digital dermoscopy and whole-body photography can be used in high-risk patients to improve the detection of early-stage melanoma. If available, confocal reflectance microscopy can also improve the clinical diagnosis in special cases. Melanoma is classified according to the 8th version of the American Joint Committee on Cancer classification. For thin melanomas up to a tumor thickness of 0.8 mm, no further diagnostic imaging is required. From stage IB, lymph node sonography is recommended, but no further imaging examinations. From stage IIB/C, whole-body examinations with computed tomography or positron emission tomography CT in combination with magnetic resonance imaging of the brain are recommended. From stage IIB/C and higher, a mutation test is recommended, especially for the BRAF V600 mutation. It is important to perform a structured follow-up to detect relapses and secondary primary melanomas as early as possible. A stage-based follow-up regimen is proposed, which in the experience of the guideline group covers the optimal requirements, although further studies may be considered. This guideline is valid until the end of 2026.",1846
39699884,Radiation Myelitis Risk After Hypofractionated Spine Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy.,JAMA oncology,2025,"Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) for spinal metastases improves symptomatic outcomes and local control compared to conventional radiotherapy. Treatment failure most often occurs within the epidural space, where dose is constrained by the risk of radiation myelitis (RM). Current constraints designed to prevent RM after spine SBRT are derived from limited data. To characterize the risk of RM after spine SBRT and to update the dosimetric constraints for preventing it. This cohort study was conducted in a single tertiary cancer care center with patients treated for spinal metastases from 2014 to 2023. All included participants had undergone spine SBRT, had a minimum of 1-month follow-up with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), a maximal cord dose to a voxel (Dmax) greater than 0 Gy, and no overlapping prior radiotherapy. In all, 2051 patients received SBRT to 2835 spinal metastases (levels C1-L2) during the study period. Three-fraction spine SBRT to a prescription dose of 27 to 36 Gy. RM defined as radiographic evidence of spinal cord injury in the treatment field, classified as grade (G) 1 to G4 or G3 to G4 per the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 5.0. Multiple dosimetric parameters of the true spinal cord structure were assessed for an association with risk of RM to determine the important covariates associated with this toxicity. The analysis included 1423 patients (mean [SD] age, 61.6 [12.9] years; 695 [48.8%] females and 728 [51.1%] males) who received SBRT for 1904 spinal metastases. Among them, 30 cases of RM were identified, 19 of which were classified as G3 to G4. Two years after SBRT, the rate of G1 to G4 RM was 1.8% (95% CI, 1.2%-2.5%) and the rate of G3 to G4 RM was 1.1% (95% CI, 0.7%-1.7%). The minimum dose to the 0.1 cm3 of spinal cord receiving the greatest dose (D0.1cc) was the most important covariate on univariable cause-specific hazards regression for RM (for G3 to G4: hazard ratio, 2.14; 95% CI, 1.68-2.72; P < .001). A true cord D0.1cc of 19.1 Gy and Dmax of 20.8 Gy estimated a 1.0% risk (95% CI, 0.3%-1.6% and 0.4%-1.6%, respectively) of G3 to G4 RM 2 years after SBRT. The findings of this cohort study indicate that a cord (myelogram or MRI-derived) D0.1cc constraint of 19.1 Gy and a Dmax constraint of 20.8 Gy correspond with a 1.0% risk of G3 to G4 RM at 2 years.",2351
39699680,Heterogeneity in response to neoadjuvant radiotherapy between soft tissue sarcoma histotypes: associations between radiology and pathology findings.,European radiology,2025,"To investigate imaging biomarkers of tumour response by describing changes in imaging and pathology findings after neoadjuvant radiotherapy (nRT) and exploring their correlations. Tumour diameter, volume, and tumour-to-muscle signal intensity (SI) ratio were collected before and after radiotherapy in a cohort of 107 patients with intermediate/high-grade STS and were correlated with post-radiotherapy pathology findings (percentage of necrosis, viable cells, and fibrosis) using Spearman Rank test. Pathological complete response (pCR) was defined as no residual viable cells present, whereas the presence of < 10% viable cells was defined as near-complete pathologic response (near-pCR). Median amount of necrosis, viable cells, and fibrosis after nRT were 10%, 30%, and 25%, respectively. 7% of patients achieved pCR and 22% near-pCR. No changes in tumour volume were found except for subtypes myxoid liposarcoma (mLPS) -Δ54.47%, undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (UPS) +Δ24.22% and dedifferentiated liposarcoma (dLPS) +Δ35.91%. The median change of tumour-to-muscle SI ratio was -19.7% for the entire population, whereas it was -19.55% and -36.26% for UPS and mLPS, respectively. Correlations (positive and negative) were found between change in volume and the presence of necrosis or fibrosis (r STS displays extensive heterogeneity in response patterns after nRT. In some subgroups, particularly UPS and mLPS, tumour size changes or tumour-to-muscle SI ratio are significantly linked with the percentage of viable cells, fibrosis, or necrosis. Question How do primary soft tissue sarcomas (STS) respond to neoadjuvant therapy, and what correlations exist between pathological findings and imaging characteristics in assessing treatment response? Findings mLPS shrank post-nRT; undifferentiated pleomorphic and dLPSs enlarged. Volume increase correlated with higher necrosis and lower fibrosis; tumour-to-muscle intensity ratio correlated with viable cells. Clinical relevance These findings emphasise the extensive heterogeneity in STS response to nRT across different subtypes. Preoperative correlations between tumour volume and SI changes with necrosis, fibrosis, and viable cells can aid in more precise treatment assessment and prognostication.",2259
39699676,MRI-based microvascular invasion prediction in mass-forming intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma: survival and therapeutic benefit.,European radiology,2025,"To establish an MRI-based model for microvascular invasion (MVI) prediction in mass-forming intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (MF-iCCA) and further evaluate its potential survival and therapeutic benefit. One hundred and fifty-six pathologically confirmed MF-iCCAs with traditional surgery (121 in training and 35 in validation cohorts), 33 with neoadjuvant treatment and 57 with first-line systemic therapy were retrospectively included. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses were performed to identify the independent predictors for MVI in the traditional surgery group, and an MVI-predictive model was constructed. Survival analyses were conducted and compared between MRI-predicted MVI-positive and MVI-negative MF-iCCAs in different treatment groups. Tumor multinodularity (odds ratio = 4.498, p < 0.001) and peri-tumor diffusion-weighted hyperintensity (odds ratio = 4.163, p < 0.001) were independently significant variables associated with MVI. AUC values for the predictive model were 0.760 [95% CI 0.674, 0.833] in the training cohort and 0.757 [95% CI 0.583, 0.885] in the validation cohort. Recurrence-free survival or progression-free survival of the MRI-predicted MVI-positive patients was significantly shorter than the MVI-negative patients in all three treatment groups (log-rank p < 0.001 to 0.046). The use of neoadjuvant therapy was not associated with improved postoperative recurrence-free survival for high-risk MF-iCCA patients in both MRI-predicted MVI-positive and MVI-negative groups (log-rank p = 0.79 and 0.27). Advanced MF-iCCA patients of the MRI-predicted MVI-positive group had significantly worse objective response rate than the MVI-negative group with systemic therapy (40.91% vs 76.92%, χ The MRI-based MVI-predictive model could be a potential biomarker for personalized risk stratification and survival prediction in MF-iCCA patients with varied therapies and may aid in candidate selection for systemic therapy. Question Identifying intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (iCCA) patients at high risk for microvascular invasion (MVI) may inform prognostic risk stratification and guide clinical treatment decision. Findings We established an MRI-based predictive model for MVI in mass-forming-iCCA, integrating imaging features of tumor multinodularity and peri-tumor diffusion-weighted hyperintensity. Clinical relevance The MRI-based MVI-predictive model could be a potential biomarker for personalized risk stratification and survival prediction across varied therapies and may aid in therapeutic candidate selection for systemic therapy.",2582
39699673,Dual-energy CT for differentiation of hypodense liver lesions in pancreatic adenocarcinoma.,European radiology,2025,"To assess the accuracy of CT spectral HU curve assessment of hypodense liver lesions. In this retrospective HIPAA-compliant study (January 2016 through May 2023), patients with biopsy-proven pancreatic adenocarcinoma and a biopsied indeterminate liver lesion underwent a DECT abdominal CT scan. Spectral HU curves were provided for each hypodense liver lesion, and slopes were calculated. Lesion Hounsfield units, iodine concentration and virtual enhancement were recorded. The Wilcoxon rank sum test was used to compare malignant and benign lesions. Optimal cutoff points were estimated using ROC curves and Youden's Index. Thirty-six patients (19 men, 17 women) with a mean age of 63 years ± 9 (standard deviation), a mean height of 170.9 cm ± 9.5, a mean weight of 69.8 kg ± 14.5, and a body mass index of 23.9 kg/m Spectral HU curves and iodine concentration of well-defined hypodense liver lesions are highly accurate in the diagnosis of benign versus malignant lesions. Question Limited evidence exists for spectral imaging diagnosis of liver lesions-can DECT accurately differentiate between benign and metastatic hypodense liver lesions? Findings Ninety-two hypodense liver lesions evaluated using HU keV curve slope, iodine concentration, and virtual enhancement resulted in accurate benign versus metastatic differentiation. Clinical relevance Hypodense liver lesions are a challenging issue at staging, often requiring further imaging, follow-up, and/or biopsy. The additional information from multi-energy CT can be useful to differentiate between benign and malignant lesions, thereby reducing the need for costly additional evaluation.",1649
39699671,Evaluation of a deep learning prostate cancer detection system on biparametric MRI against radiological reading.,European radiology,2025,"This study aims to evaluate a deep learning pipeline for detecting clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa), defined as Gleason Grade Group (GGG) ≥ 2, using biparametric MRI (bpMRI) and compare its performance with radiological reading. The training dataset included 4381 bpMRI cases (3800 positive and 581 negative) across three continents, with 80% annotated using PI-RADS and 20% with Gleason Scores. The testing set comprised 328 cases from the PROSTATEx dataset, including 34% positive (GGG ≥ 2) and 66% negative cases. A 3D nnU-Net was trained on bpMRI for lesion detection, evaluated using histopathology-based annotations, and assessed with patient- and lesion-level metrics, along with lesion volume, and GGG. The algorithm was compared to non-expert radiologists using multi-parametric MRI (mpMRI). The model achieved an AUC of 0.83 (95% CI: 0.80, 0.87). Lesion-level sensitivity was 0.85 (95% CI: 0.82, 0.94) at 0.5 False Positives per volume (FP/volume) and 0.88 (95% CI: 0.79, 0.92) at 1 FP/volume. Average Precision was 0.55 (95% CI: 0.46, 0.64). The model showed over 0.90 sensitivity for lesions larger than 650 mm³ and exceeded 0.85 across GGGs. It had higher true positive rates (TPRs) than radiologists equivalent FP rates, achieving TPRs of 0.93 and 0.79 compared to radiologists' 0.87 and 0.68 for PI-RADS ≥ 3 and PI-RADS ≥ 4 lesions (p ≤ 0.05). The DL model showed strong performance in detecting csPCa on an independent test cohort, surpassing radiological interpretation and demonstrating AI's potential to improve diagnostic accuracy for non-expert radiologists. However, detecting small lesions remains challenging. Question Current prostate cancer detection methods often do not involve non-expert radiologists, highlighting the need for more accurate deep learning approaches using biparametric MRI. Findings Our model outperforms radiologists significantly, showing consistent performance across Gleason Grade Groups and for medium to large lesions. Clinical relevance This AI model improves prostate detection accuracy in prostate imaging, serves as a benchmark with reference performance on a public dataset, and offers public PI-RADS annotations, enhancing transparency and facilitating further research and development.",2258
39699670,Exploring the value of multiparametric quantitative MRI in the assessment of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma fibrosis grading.,European radiology,2025,"To analyze the performance of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in quantification of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) fibrosis grading. This prospective study enrolled 79 patients with PDAC confirmed by pathology. Multiparametric MRI including native T1 mapping, intravoxel incoherent motion diffusion-weighted imaging (IVIM-DWI), diffusion kurtosis imaging diffusion-weighted imaging (DKI-DWI), and enhanced T1 mapping were performed before surgery. Masson staining was used to evaluate intratumoral fibrosis content and classified into low- and high-fibrosis groups. MRI parameters were compared between the two groups using multivariable logistic regression analysis. The correlations between fibrosis content and MRI parameters were evaluated using Pearson's correlation. D, f, mean diffusion (MD), and enhanced T1 mapping were lower in the high-fibrosis group than in the low-fibrosis group (p < 0.001, p < 0.001, p < 0.001, p = 0.026, respectively). Native T1 mapping and extracellular volume (ECV) were opposite (All p < 0.001). No significant differences in the rest. Multivariable logistic regression revealed that native T1 mapping, MD, and ECV were independent discriminators for PDAC fibrosis grading (p = 0.037, p = 0.031, p = 0.014, respectively); the area under the curve (AUC) of native T1 mapping, MD and ECV was 0.863, 0.798, and 0.929. Among them, ECV had an extremely strong positive correlation with intratumoral fibrosis content. Native T1 mapping and MD were correlated strongly with fibrosis content (positive and negative, respectively). ECV had the highest assessing performance for grading fibrosis in PDAC compared to other MRI parameters, and has the potential to be an imaging biomarker for predicting the fibrosis content of PDAC. Question The relationship between fibrosis grade of PDAC and quantitative MRI parameters based on T1 mapping and diffusion imaging has not been fully investigated. Findings ECV performed the best in distinguishing between fibrosis grade and increased as interstitial fibrosis increased; clinical indicators offered no added value. Clinical relevance Quantitative MRI parameters provide significant value in evaluating the fibrosis grade of PDAC, which bears significant implications for preoperative risk stratification and the selection of personalized treatment strategies for patients.",2372
39694886,Can structured integration of BI-RADS criteria by a clinical decision rule reduce the number of unnecessary biopsies in BI-RADS 4 lesions? A systematic review and meta-analysis.,European radiology,2025,"This systematic review and meta-analysis investigate the added value of structured integration of Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) criteria using the Kaiser score (KS) to avoid unnecessary biopsies in BI-RADS 4 lesions. A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted using predefined criteria. Eligible articles, published in English until May 2024, dealt with KS in the context of BI-RADS 4 MRI. Two reviewers extracted study characteristics, including true positives (TP), false positives (FP), true negatives (TN), and false negatives (FN). Sensitivity, specificity, negative likelihood ratio, and positive likelihood ratio were calculated using bivariate random effects. Fagan nomograms identified the maximum pre-test probability at which post-test probabilities of a negative MRI aligned with the 2% malignancy rate benchmark for downgrading BI-RADS 4 to BI-RADS 3. I² statistics and meta-regression explored sources of heterogeneity. p-values < 0.05 were considered significant. Seven studies with 1877 lesions (833 malignant, 1044 benign) were included. The average breast cancer prevalence was 47.3%. Pooled sensitivity was 94.3% (95%-CI 88.9%-97.1%), and pooled specificity was 68.1% (95%-CI 56.6%-77.7%) using a random effects model. Overall, 52/833 cases were FNs (6.2%). Fagan nomograms showed that KS could rule out breast cancer in BI-RADS 4 lesions at a pre-test probability of 20.3% for all lesions, 25.4% for masses, and 15.2% for non-mass lesions. In MRI-assessed BI-RADS 4 lesions, applying structured BI-RADS criteria with the KS reduces unnecessary biopsies by 70% with a 6.2% FN rate. Breast cancer can be ruled out up to pre-test probabilities of 20.3%. Question What, if any, value is added by structured integration of BI-RADS criteria using the Kaiser Score (KS) to avoid unnecessary biopsies in BI-RADS 4 lesions? Findings The structured integration of BI-RADS criteria using the Kaiser Score (KS) reduces unnecessary biopsies in BI-RADS 4 lesions by 70%. Clinical relevance The structured approach offered by the Kaiser Score (KS) avoids unnecessary recalls, potentially reducing patient anxiety, lessening the burden on medical personnel, and the need for further imaging and biopsies due to more objective and thus efficient clinical decision-making in evaluating BI-RADS 4 lesions.",2337
39694884,Amide proton transfer weighted MRI measurements yield consistent and repeatable results in patients with gliomas: a prospective test-retest study.,European radiology,2025,"Chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) imaging has emerged as a promising imaging biomarker, but its reliability for clinical practice remains uncertain. This study aimed to investigate the robustness of CEST parameters in healthy volunteers and patients with brain tumours. A total of n = 52 healthy volunteers and n = 52 patients with histologically confirmed glioma underwent two consecutive 3-T MRI scans separated by a 1-min break. The CEST measurements were reconstructed using two models: with and without fluid suppression and included the evaluation of both amide (amidePTw) and amine (aminePTw) offsets. Mean intensity values in healthy volunteers were compared from volumetric segmentations (VOI) of grey matter, white matter, and the whole brain. Mean intensity values in brain tumour patients were assessed from VOI of the contrast-enhancing, non-enhancing and whole tumour, as well as from the normal-appearing white matter. Test-retest reliability was assessed using ICC and Bland-Altman plots. The amidePTw/aminePTw signal intensity distribution was significantly affected by fluid suppression (p < 0.001 for each VOI). Test-retest reliability in healthy volunteers showed fair to excellent agreement (ICC = 0.53-0.74), with the highest signal intensity values observed by amidePTw (ICC = 0.73-0.74). In patients, an excellent agreement of both amidePTw and aminePTw measurements was observed across different tumour regions (ICC = 0.76-0.89), with the highest ICC for contrast-enhancing tumour measurements. Bland-Altman analysis indicated negligible systematic bias and no proportional bias in measurement errors. Measurements from amide/aminePTw imaging obtained from an adequately powered test-retest study yield consistent and reproducible results in glioma patients, as a prerequisite for robust imaging biomarker discovery in neuro-oncology. Question The clinical reliability of chemical exchange saturation transfer imaging remains uncertain, necessitating further investigation to establish its robustness as a biomarker in neuro-oncology. Findings This study demonstrates that amide/amine proton transfer imaging provides repeatable, high-agreement measurements in glioma patients, particularly in contrast-enhancing tumour regions. Clinical relevance This test-retest study demonstrates that chemical exchange saturation transfer imaging using two models and assessing amide and amine offsets yield consistent and repeatable results in glioma patients, as a prerequisite for robust imaging biomarker discovery for neuro-oncology studies and clinical practice.",2592
39670974,Longitudinal Blood Immune-Inflammatory and Radiomic Profiling to Decode Different Patterns of Acquired Resistance to Immunotherapy in Patients with NSCLC.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,2025,"To uncover the underpinnings of acquired resistance (AR) to immunotherapy (IO), we determined whether distinctive clinicopathologic, radiomic, and peripheral blood (PB) immune-inflammatory features reflect oligo- and systemic (sys)-AR in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) undergoing immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. On 105 consecutive patients with IO-treated advanced NSCLC, PB immunophenotypes, cytokines, and CT-derived radiomic features (RF), extracted from primary and merged metastatic lesions, were prospectively collected at baseline (T0) and at the first disease assessment (T1, 9-12 weeks), and their Δ variation [(T1-T0)/T0] was computed. AR, defined as progression after the initial response (complete/partial) or stable disease ≥6 months, was subdivided according to the number of new and/or progressive lesions in oligoAR (≤3) and sysAR (>3). Clinicopathologic, PB, and radiomic parameters and survival outcomes were statistically correlated to AR patterns. OligoAR and sysAR involved 24% and 12.4% of cases, respectively. Whereas baseline PB immune profiles were comparable, a Δpos cytotoxic (NK, CD8+granzyme B+) and Δneg immunosuppressive (CD14+ monocytes) dynamic coupled with different modulations of IL-6, TGF-β1, TNFα, and soluble PD-L1 represented distinctive features of oligoAR versus sysAR (P < 0.05). Significantly longer postprogression survival characterized oligoAR versus sysAR (median 20.3 vs. 5.6 months; HR, 0.22; P < 0.001). The number and sites of oligoAR involvement appeared to condition the blood immune background (P < 0.05) and survival. ΔRFs outperformed baseline RFs, with 15 ΔRFs sharply discriminating oligoAR from sysAR (P range: <0.001-0.04). ROC analysis confirmed the optimal performance of top-ranked ΔRFs (AUC range: 0.88-0.99). Longitudinal analysis of blood-immune hallmarks and radiomic descriptors may decipher distinct patterns of AR to IO in advanced patients with NSCLC.

39666360,Oncological Safety of MRI-Informed Biopsy Decision-Making in Men With Suspected Prostate Cancer.,JAMA oncology,2025,"The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) pathway for diagnosing clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa; defined as International Society of Urological Pathology grade group ≥2) uses multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) for prostate biopsy (PB) decision-making. However, the intermediate impact on patient outcomes in men with negative MRI results avoiding PB and men with positive MRI results without PCa remains unknown. To assess the feasibility and safety of a community-based MRI diagnostic strategy in men with suspected PCa using 3-year active monitoring. This multisite, longitudinal cohort trial took place across 54 community-based urology practices and 2 radiology imaging centers at a referral academic institution in Berlin, Germany. Eligible participants aged 18 to 75 years with clinically suspected PCa were enrolled between September 2016 and December 2017 and monitored for 3 years. Final analysis was reported on December 23, 2023. Participants underwent 3-T mpMRI. Men with findings suspected to be PCa were recommended for targeted PB (diagnostic phase). Men with negative mpMRI results or positive mpMRI results with benign findings at PB were systematically monitored for 3 years (monitoring phase). Clinical visits were recommended every 6 months. The total proportion of men avoiding PB and those with csPCa. A total of 593 men (median [IQR] age, 64 [58-70] years) underwent mpMRI, with 286 (48%) having negative MRI results, 261 (44%) avoiding PB initially, and 242 (41%) avoiding PB over 3 years. csPCa was detected in 161 (27%) men after immediate PB, increasing to 172 (29%) men after 3 years. Seven men with negative MRI results were diagnosed with PCa by immediate PB (including 4 cases of csPCa), while 279 entered monitoring. Three-year monitoring was completed by 233 (84%) men, with 7 diagnoses of csPCa. Of 307 men with positive MRI results, 58 (19%) showed no PCa after immediate PB, of which 41 (71%) completed monitoring and 4 (7%) were diagnosed with csPCa. In this cohort study, men with negative mpMRI results avoiding biopsy were not at elevated risk of csPCa. The study confirms the oncological safety of the prebiopsy MRI strategy of avoiding an immediate PB after negative MRI results when a programmatic safety net is in place.",2267
39665988,Noninvasive identification of proliferative hepatocellular carcinoma on multiphase dynamic CT: quantitative and LI-RADS lexicon-based evaluation.,European radiology,2025,"To identify proliferative hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) preoperatively using quantitative measurements combined with the updated standard 2021 LI-RADS universal lexicon-based qualitative features on multiphase dynamic CT (MDCT). We retrospectively analyzed 273 patients (102 proliferative HCCs) who underwent preoperative MDCT with surgically confirmed HCC in two medical centers. Imaging features were evaluated according to the updated 2021 LI-RADS universal lexicon, and quantitative measurements were analyzed. All MDCT findings and clinical factors were compared. Four predictive models (clinical, CT quantitative-clinical, CT qualitative-clinical, and combinational models) were developed and validated in an external cohort for identifying proliferative HCC. ROC analysis was used to assess model performances. All models were tested in a subgroup of patients with a single lesion ≤ 5 cm (n = 124). Both the CT quantitative-clinical and CT qualitative-clinical models effectively identified proliferative HCC in the training and external validation cohorts (all AUCs > 0.79). The combinational model, integrating one clinical (AFP ≥ 200 ng/mL), three qualitative (rim arterial phase hyperenhancement (APHE), non-smooth tumor margin, and incomplete or absent capsule), and one quantitative feature (standardized tumor-to-aorta density ratio in portal venous phase ≤ (- 0.13), showed significant improvement in the training cohort (AUC 0.871) and comparable performance in the validation cohort (AUC 0.870). Additionally, AFP ≥ 200 ng/mL and Rim APHE were significantly associated with HCC recurrence (p < 0.05). The combinational model, integrating clinical, CT quantitative, and qualitative features, shows potential for the noninvasively preoperative prediction of proliferative HCC. Further validation is needed to establish its broader clinical utility. Question Preoperative identification of proliferative HCC could influence patient treatment and prognosis, yet there is no CT-based universally applicable model to identify this subtype. Findings The updated standard 2021 LI-RADS universal lexicon-based features, in combination with quantitative MDCT measurements, could aid in the noninvasive detection of proliferative HCC. Clinical relevance The updated standard 2021 LI-RADS universal lexicon-based CT qualitative features and quantitative measurements may aid in identifying proliferative HCC and tumor recurrence, offering potential guidance for personalized treatment. Further studies are required to assess their generalizability to different clinical scenarios.",2586
39661150,CT-based radiomic prognostic vector (RPV) predicts survival and stromal histology in high-grade serous ovarian cancer: an external validation study.,European radiology,2025,"In women with high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC), a CT-based radiomic prognostic vector (RPV) predicted stromal phenotype and survival after primary surgery. The study's purpose was to fully externally validate RPV and its biological correlate. In this retrospective study, ovarian masses on CT scans of HGSOC patients, who underwent primary cytoreductive surgery in an ESGO-certified Center between 2002 and 2017, were segmented for external RPV score calculation and then correlated with overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). A subset of tissue samples subjected to fibronectin immunohistochemistry were evaluated by a gynaeco-pathologist for stromal content. Kaplan-Meier log-rank test and a Cox proportional hazards model were used for outcome analysis. Among 340 women with HGSOC, 244 ovarian lesions were available for segmentation in 198 women (mean age 59.8 years, range 34-92). Median OS was 48.69 months (IQR: 27.0-102.5) and PFS was 19.3 months (IQR: 13-32.2). Using multivariate Cox analysis, poor OS was associated with RPV-high (HR 3.17; 95% CI: 1.32-7.60; p = 0.0099), post-operative residual disease (HR 2.04; 95% CI: 1.30-3.20; p = 0.0020), and FIGO stage III/IV (HR 1.79; 95% CI: 1.11-2.86; p = 0.016). Age did not influence OS. RPV-high tissue had higher stromal content based on fibronectin expression (mean 48.9%, SD 10.5%) compared to RPV-low cases (mean 14.9%, SD 10.5%, p < 0.0001). RPV score was not significantly associated with PFS. Patients with HGSOC and RPV-high ovarian mass on pre-operative CT had significantly worse OS following primary surgery and a higher stromal content compared to RPV-low masses, externally validating the RPV and its biological interpretation. Question Can the performance of a previously described RPV in women with HGSOC be replicated when licenced to an external institution? Findings External validation of RPV among 244 ovarian lesions demonstrated that, on multivariate analysis, OS was associated with RPV, stage, and postoperative residual disease, replicating previous findings. Clinical relevance External validation of a radiomic tool is an essential step in translation to clinical applicability and provides the basis for prospective validation. In clinical practice, this RPV may allow more personalized decision-making for women with ovarian cancer being considered for extensive cytoreductive surgery.",2401
39661030,BEEx Is an Open-Source Tool That Evaluates Batch Effects in Medical Images to Enable Multicenter Studies.,Cancer research,2025,"The batch effect is a nonbiological variation that arises from technical differences across different batches of data during the data generation process for acquisition-related reasons, such as collection of images at different sites or using different scanners. This phenomenon can affect the robustness and generalizability of computational pathology- or radiology-based cancer diagnostic models, especially in multicenter studies. To address this issue, we developed an open-source platform, Batch Effect Explorer (BEEx), that is designed to qualitatively and quantitatively determine whether batch effects exist among medical image datasets from different sites. A suite of tools was incorporated into BEEx that provide visualization and quantitative metrics based on intensity, gradient, and texture features to allow users to determine whether there are any image variables or combinations of variables that can distinguish datasets from different sites in an unsupervised manner. BEEx was designed to support various medical imaging techniques, including microscopy and radiology. Four use cases clearly demonstrated the ability of BEEx to identify batch effects and validated the effectiveness of rectification methods for batch effect reduction. Overall, BEEx is a scalable and versatile framework designed to read, process, and analyze a wide range of medical images to facilitate the identification and mitigation of batch effects, which can enhance the reliability and validity of image-based studies. Significance: BEEx is a prescreening tool for image-based analyses that allows researchers to evaluate batch effects in multicenter studies and determine their origin and magnitude to facilitate development of accurate AI-based cancer models.",1756
39658685,A predictive model for cerebellar mutism syndrome based on lesion map in children with medulloblastoma.,European radiology,2025,"This study aimed to establish a voxel-based map to predict the occurrence of cerebellar mutism syndrome (CMS) and investigate the relationship between CMS and motor dysfunction. This multicenter study cohort included 224 patients diagnosed with medulloblastoma at Beijing Children's Hospital (n = 88) and Beijing Tiantan Hospital (n = 136). The dataset was randomly divided into training (n = 95), test (n = 41), and validation (n = 88) datasets. Voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping (VLSM) was used to identify the corresponding tumoral voxels for CMS and motor dysfunction. A prediction model was constructed based on the VLSM results. The two cohorts showed significant differences in hydrocephalus (58.0 vs. 32.4%, p < 0.001), paraventricular edema (83.0 vs. 59.6%, p < 0.001), and presurgical ventricular-peritoneal shunt placement (53.7 vs. 10.2%, p < 0.001). The CMS group had a significantly higher rate of hydrocephalus than the non-CMS group (54.6 vs. 33.1%; p = 0.002). VLSM revealed that the left inferior cerebellar peduncle (32.26%), right dentate gyrus (24.23%), and right X lobule (21.79%) were the most impaired structures associated with CMS. CMS-related areas overlapped with motor planning and verbal fluency regions, while areas associated with motor dysfunction overlapped with motor planning. The prediction model achieved areas under the curve of 0.733, and 0.702 for the testing and external validation datasets, respectively. VLSM-based models are used to predict CMS occurrence prior to surgery. CMS was related to motor planning and verbal fluency regions of the cerebellum. Motor dysfunction was associated with CMS functionally. Question Cerebellar mutism syndrome (CMS) is a severe postoperative complication of medulloblastoma for which the specific responsible anatomical correlates remain unclear. Findings We identified areas associated with CMS in Voxel-based Lesion-Symptom Mapping (VLSM), which were used to establish the CMS predicting model. Clinical relevance VLSM analysis helps develop a reliable predictive model for CMS and explore its association with motor dysfunction, The establishment of this model will facilitate the prediction of CMS in clinical practice.",2206
39658684,Comparison of abbreviated and complete MRI protocols for treatment response assessment of colorectal liver metastases.,European radiology,2025,"To compare abbreviated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to complete MRI for treatment response assessment of colorectal liver metastases. This retrospective study included consecutive patients with colorectal liver metastases between January 1, 2012, and December 3, 2021, who were undergoing chemotherapy and who had at least one follow-up gadoxetic-enhanced MRI. For each patient, two MRIs (baseline MRI and follow-up MRI) were randomly selected. Follow-up MRIs were separated into two sets of images: complete MRIs, including all imaging sequences, and abbreviated MRIs, including coronal and axial hepatobiliary phase imaging, axial diffusion-weighted imaging, and coronal T2-weighted imaging. Seven radiologists reviewed the two sets of images, with a month's break in between, assessing Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 category and the presence of new lesions, with each reader assigned 80-91 patients. Inter-reader agreement was assessed using Fleiss' kappa (κ). One-hundred ninety-five patients (mean age 54.4 +/- 12.1 years, 135 men) were evaluated. Intra-reader agreement between abbreviated and complete MRI was substantial for the RECIST 1.1 category (κ, 0.66-0.89) and the detection of new lesions (κ, 0.63-0.81). Inter-reader agreement was substantial for RECIST 1.1 category using abbreviated MRI and complete MRI (κ, 0.71 (95% CI: 0.65-0.78) and 0.68 (95% CI: 0.61-0.75)), and moderate for the presence of new lesions using abbreviated MRI and complete MRI (κ, 0.56 (95% CI: 0.41-0.69) and 0.49 (95% CI: 0.35-0.65)). Abbreviated MRI may serve as an alternative to complete MRI for the follow-up of patients with colorectal liver metastases. Question Abbreviated MRI is a time-saving and cost-effective exam, but only one study has compared it with complete MRI for treatment response assessment of colorectal liver metastases. Findings In our study, abbreviated follow-up MRI achieved substantial inter-reader agreement for the RECIST 1.1 category and moderate inter-reader agreement for the presence of new lesions. Clinical relevance Abbreviated liver MRIs are adequate substitutes for complete liver MRIs for colorectal liver metastases in the follow-up setting when the goal is to assess treatment response, resulting in shorter examination times and potential reductions in costs.",2327
39658681,A novel hybrid model for predicting tertiary lymphoid structures and targeted immunotherapy outcomes in hepatocellular carcinoma: a multicenter retrospective study.,European radiology,2025,"To develop a novel hybrid model for preoperative prediction of tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs) of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and to identify patients who may benefit from postoperative targeted immunotherapy. Retrospective data were gathered from 332 patients with HCC who underwent surgical resection and gadoxetate disodium (Gd-EOB-DTPA) enhanced MRI at two tertiary hospitals (training cohort, n = 205; internal validation cohort, n = 90; and external validation cohort, n = 37) between March 2020 and January 2023. Radiomic features were extracted from Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI sequences. These signatures were integrated with clinical-radiologic (CR) factors into a hybrid model and nomogram for clinical application. The performance of the model was assessed using the area under the curve (AUC) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). The hybrid model outperformed the radiomics and CR models in the training cohort (AUC = 0.860 [95% CI: 0.805, 0.904], 0.784 [95% CI: 0.721, 0.838], and 0.809 [95% CI: 0.748, 0.860]). The hybrid model showed optimal performance, with AUCs of 0.823 (95% CI: 0.728, 0.895) and 0.875 (95% CI: 0.725, 0.960) in the internal and external validation cohorts, respectively. The calibration curve demonstrated that the nomogram had good diagnostic ability, and decision curve analysis indicated good clinical utility across all cohorts. Importantly, patients with a predicted high risk of TLSs from the hybrid model gained a survival benefit from targeted immunotherapy. The hybrid model showed satisfactory performance in predicting intra-tumoral TLS positivity and targeted immunotherapy benefit in patients with HCC, potentially assisting clinicians in selecting precise individualized therapies. Question How can accurate preoperative risk stratification of tertiary lymphoid structures positivity HCC be achieved to support targeted immunotherapy decision-making? Findings A hybrid model combining radiomics model and clinical-radiological model may be a reliable marker for predicting tertiary lymphoid structures positivity HCC. Clinical relevance Using this hybrid model may be useful in predicting tertiary lymphoid structures and screening candidate patients for targeted immunotherapy based on multiparametric MRI, which has potential clinical value in guiding clinical decision-making and improving patient outcomes.",2365
39656118,The QIBA Profile for Dynamic Susceptibility Contrast MRI Quantitative Imaging Biomarkers for Assessing Gliomas.,Radiology,2024,"The dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) MRI measures of relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) play a central role in monitoring therapeutic response and disease progression in patients with gliomas. Previous investigations have demonstrated promise of using rCBV in classifying tumor grade, elucidating tumor viability after therapy, and differentiating pseudoprogression and pseudoresponse. However, the quantification and reproducibility of rCBV measurements across patients, devices, and software remain a critical barrier to routine or clinical trial use of longitudinal DSC MRI in patients with gliomas. To address this limitation, the RSNA DSC MRI Biomarker Committee of the Quantitative Imaging Biomarkers Alliance developed a Profile that defines statistics-based claims for the precision of longitudinal measurements. Although rCBV is the clinical marker of interest, the Profile focused on the reproducibility of the measured quantitative imaging biomarker, which is the area under the contrast agent concentration-time curve (AUC) normalized by the mean value of normal-appearing contralateral white matter tissue (tissue-normalized AUC values). Based on previous reports of within-subject coefficient of variation (wCV) in the tissue-normalized AUC values for enhancing gliomas (wCV = 0.31), an increase of 182% or more with respect to the baseline tissue-normalized AUC value indicates that an increase has occurred with 95% confidence. In contrast, a decrease of 64% or more with respect to baseline suggests that a decrease has occurred with 95% confidence. Similarly, an increase of 399% or more in the tissue-normalized AUC values in normal brain gray matter tissue (wCV = 0.40) suggests that an increase has occurred with 95% confidence, whereas a decrease of 80% or more with respect to baseline suggests that a decrease has occurred with 95% confidence. This article provides the rationale for these claims and the compliance activities needed to achieve these claims. Potential updates to incorporate new data based on advances in technology and clinical care in the Profile are also discussed.",2117
39656117,Low-Dose CT Screening in East Asian Women Who Have Never Smoked: Association between Family History of Lung Cancer and Ground-Glass Nodule Prevalence and Growth.,Radiology,2024,"Background Characteristics of ground-glass nodules (GGNs) in Asian women who have never smoked with family history of lung cancer (FHLC) remain unexamined. Purpose To investigate the differences in GGN progression to lung cancer at low-dose CT (LDCT) screening between Asian women who have never smoked with and without FHLC, and to examine associations between FHLC and GGN prevalence and growth. Materials and Methods This single-center retrospective study included East Asian women who had never smoked and had no personal history of lung cancer who underwent baseline LDCT for a health checkup between January 2011 and December 2015. Radiologists reviewed GGNs at baseline and follow-up, using Fleischner Society guidelines. Prevalence of persistent, multiple, and growing GGNs and incidence of pathology-confirmed lung cancer were compared in patients with and without FHLC. Multivariable logistic and Cox regression analyses were used to explore associations between FHLC and GGN prevalence and growth, adjusting for total size and solid proportion of baseline GGNs. Results Of 10 151 patients (mean age, 54 years ± 10 [SD]), 694 (6.8%) reported FHLC and 9457 (93.2%) did not. Among all patients, 515 (5.1%) had persistent GGNs (median follow-up period, 2551 days [IQR, 1104-3458 days]), 199 (2.0%) had multiple GGNs, 49 (0.5%) experienced GGN growth, and 31 (0.3%) were diagnosed with lung cancer. Patients with FHLC had a higher prevalence of persistent GGNs (8.2% [57 of 694] vs 4.8% [458 of 9457]; ",1508
39625504,A head-to-head comparison of breast lesion's conspicuity at contrast-enhanced mammography and contrast-enhanced MRI.,European radiology,2025,"Lesion conspicuity, the relative enhancement of a lesion compared to surrounding tissue, is a new descriptor in the ACR BI-RADS 2022 CEM supplement. We compared lesion conspicuity in contrast-enhanced mammography (CEM) and contrast-enhanced MRI (CE-MRI) in patients with suspicious breast lesions. IRB-approved retrospective study; three blinded readers rated 462 indeterminate or suspicious breast lesions in 388 patients (54.2 ± 11 years; range 30-90) who underwent CEM and CE-MRI from 2018 to 2022. Each lesion's conspicuity was scored from 1 to 5, with 5 indicating excellent conspicuity. Visual grading characteristics (VGC) analysis and area under the curve (AUC) were used for comparison, with sub-analyses for benign and malignant lesions. VGC analysis showed a significant AUC of 0.670 to 0.723 (p < 0.001) favouring CE-MRI. No lesion enhancement (score 1) was observed in 16.2% of CE-MRI and 44.7% of CEM. Excellent conspicuity was seen in 29.6% of CE-MRI and 11.9% of CEM. Sub-analysis showed higher conspicuity on CE-MRI for both malignant (AUC 0.665 to 0.732, p < 0.001) and benign lesions (AUC 0.734 to 0.798, p < 0.001). CE-MRI showed higher lesion conspicuity compared to CEM both for non-mass lesions (0.656) and for mass lesions 0.605. CE-MRI shows significantly higher conspicuity for benign and malignant breast lesions compared to CEM, especially for benign lesions. The low conspicuity of benign lesions on CEM may help reduce false positives in clinical practice. Question Lesion conspicuity is a new descriptor for lesion enhancement according to the new CEM lexicon. Data correlating lesion conspicuity with malignancy likelihood are limited. Findings Lesion conspicuity is higher for contrast-enhanced-MRI than for contrast-enhanced mammography (CEM) for all lesions but significantly better for benign lesions. Clinical relevance The low conspicuity of benign lesions on CEM may reduce false-positive results, making it a valuable tool in breast cancer screening.",1990

39623065,Volumetric histogram analysis of amide proton transfer-weighted imaging for predicting complete tumor response to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy in locally advanced rectal adenocarcinoma.,European radiology,2025,"To investigate the potential of histogram analysis applied to pre-treatment amide proton transfer-weighted (APTw) imaging in predicting complete pathological regression (pCR) in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) undergoing neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT). This retrospective study enrolled LARC patients who underwent preoperative rectal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Based on histologic assessment, the patients were divided into a pathological complete response (pCR) group or a non-pCR group. APTw histogram features, apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), and clinical parameters were analyzed. Mann-Whitney U-test, Spearman rank correlation, and univariate and multivariate logistic regression were used for statistical analysis. The predictive performances of different models were evaluated by the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC). One-hundred forty-five patients were included (mean age, 61.6 years ± 11.8 [SD]; 87 men). pCR patients exhibited lower pre-treatment ADC value, higher pre-treatment APTw-10%, APTw-90%, minimum, maximum, median, mean, range, and root mean square (RMS) of the primary tumor compared to non-pCR patients (all p < 0.05). APTw-10%, APTw-90%, maximum, mean, median, minimum, range, and RMS showed negative correlations with the tumor regression grade (TRG) category (r ranged between -0.457 and -0.173; all p < 0.005). Skewness, kurtosis, and entropy exhibited positive correlations with the TRG category (r = 0.278, 0.319, and 0.324, respectively; all p < 0.05). The combined model had a higher AUC of 0.930, with 93.9% sensitivity and 83.9% specificity. Histogram analysis of pre-treatment APTw may hold promise as a novel approach for predicting the response of LARC patients to nCRT. Question Predicting response to nCRT is crucial for early stratified management of LARC patients; however, current radiological studies remain inconclusive. Finding LARC patients with pCR is correlated with higher pre-treatment APTw intensity-related and lower shape-related histogram features. Clinical relevance The APTw-histogram model and the APTw-clinical combined model demonstrated strong diagnostic efficacy and clinical practicality in predicting LARC patients' responsiveness to nCRT, offering new insights for early clinical decision-making.",2312
39621056,Development and validation of a radiopathomics model for predicting liver metastases of colorectal cancer.,European radiology,2025,"To compare the ability of a model based on CT radiomics features, a model based on clinical data, and a fusion model based on a combination of both radiomics and clinical data to predict the risk of liver metastasis after surgery for colorectal cancer. Two hundred and twelve patients with pathologically confirmed colorectal cancer were divided into a training set (n = 148) and a validation set (n = 64). Radiomics features from the most recent CT scans and clinical data obtained before surgery were extracted. Random forest models were trained to predict tumors with clinical data and evaluated using the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC) and other metrics on the validation set. Fourteen features were selected to establish the radiomics model, which yielded an AUC of 0.751 for the training set and an AUC of 0.714 for the test set. The fusion model, based on a combination of the radiomics signature and clinical data, showed good performance in both the training set (AUC 0.952) and the test set (AUC 0.761). We have developed a fusion model that integrates radiomics features with clinical data. This fusion model could serve as a non-invasive, reliable, and accurate tool for the preoperative prediction of liver metastases after surgery for colorectal cancer. Question Can a radiomics and clinical fusion model improve the prediction of liver metastases in colorectal cancer and help optimize clinical decision-making? Findings The presented fusion model combining CT radiomics and clinical data showed superior accuracy in predicting colorectal cancer liver metastases compared to single models. Clinical relevance Our study provides a non-invasive, relatively accurate method for predicting the risk of liver metastasis, improving personalized treatment decisions, and enhancing preoperative planning and prognosis management in colorectal cancer patients.",1896
39613960,Impact of deep learning reconstruction on radiation dose reduction and cancer risk in CT examinations: a real-world clinical analysis.,European radiology,2025,"The purpose of this study is to estimate the extent to which the implementation of deep learning reconstruction (DLR) may reduce the risk of radiation-induced cancer from CT examinations, utilizing real-world clinical data. We retrospectively analyzed scan data of adult patients who underwent body CT during two periods relative to DLR implementation at our facility: a 12-month pre-DLR phase (n = 5553) using hybrid iterative reconstruction and a 12-month post-DLR phase (n = 5494) with routine CT reconstruction transitioning to DLR. To ensure comparability between two groups, we employed propensity score matching 1:1 based on age, sex, and body mass index. Dose data were collected to estimate organ-specific equivalent doses and total effective doses. We assessed the average dose reduction post-DLR implementation and estimated the Lifetime Attributable Risk (LAR) for cancer per CT exam pre- and post-DLR implementation. The number of radiation-induced cancers before and after the implementation of DLR was also estimated. After propensity score matching, 5247 cases from each group were included in the final analysis. Post-DLR, the total effective body CT dose significantly decreased to 15.5 ± 10.3 mSv from 28.1 ± 14.0 mSv pre-DLR (p < 0.001), a 45% reduction. This dose reduction significantly lowered the radiation-induced cancer risk, especially among younger women, with the estimated annual cancer incidence from 0.247% pre-DLR to 0.130% post-DLR. The implementation of DLR has the possibility to reduce radiation dose by 45% and the risk of radiation-induced cancer from 0.247 to 0.130% as compared with the iterative reconstruction. Question Can implementing deep learning reconstruction (DLR) in routine CT scans significantly reduce radiation dose and the risk of radiation-induced cancer compared to hybrid iterative reconstruction? Findings DLR reduced the total effective body CT dose by 45% (from 28.1 ± 14.0 mSv to 15.5 ± 10.3 mSv) and decreased estimated cancer incidence from 0.247 to 0.130%. Clinical relevance Adopting DLR in clinical practice substantially lowers radiation exposure and cancer risk from CT exams, enhancing patient safety, especially for younger women, and underscores the importance of advanced imaging techniques.",2265
39613959,Super delayed phase imaging in gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI: investigating factors contributing to improved liver contrast.,European radiology,2025,"To assess whether extended delayed phase imaging, performed after gadoxetic acid administration for 60-120 min (termed as super delayed phase [SDP]), improves liver contrast and nodule visibility in patients with chronic liver disease and to identify predictors for contrast enhancement. In this retrospective study, 116 patients with chronic liver disease were selected from 6933 gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI examinations, which included SDP images. The liver-to-spleen contrast (LSC) was quantitatively evaluated, and factors influencing the improvement of LSC were analyzed. By comparing the standard hepatobiliary phase images at 20 min post-contrast (HBP20) with SDP images, nodule visibility was evaluated by two readers who were blinded to the study. SDP significantly enhanced LSC (SDP: 1.81 ± 0.48 vs HBP20: 1.50 ± 0.34, p < 0.001) and improved nodule visibility in patients with initially poor LSC. Total bilirubin levels and visible biliary excretion during HBP20 are predictors of LSC enhancement. Furthermore, nodule visibility scores significantly increased in the group with poor initial contrast (Reader 1: from 2.92 ± 1.57 to 3.79 ± 1.44; Reader 2: from 2.34 ± 1.42 to 3.36 ± 1.57, p < 0.001). SDP enhanced liver contrast and nodule detection in patients with chronic liver disease, particularly in those with impaired liver function. Total bilirubin levels and visible biliary excretion during HBP20 are useful predictors of improvement. This technique may improve the diagnostic utility of MRI for hepatocarcinogenesis in cirrhotic nodules, specifically for detecting precursors of hepatocellular carcinoma, in cirrhotic patients with compromised liver function. Question In gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI, inadequate liver contrast can occur in patients with impaired liver function, potentially limiting the diagnostic value of the examination. Findings SDP images improved liver parenchymal signal intensity and visibility of hepatocellular carcinoma, even in cases with impaired liver function. Clinical relevance The addition of SDP imaging in gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI improves liver contrast and early detection of hepatocellular carcinoma, especially in patients with impaired liver function, such as Child-Pugh B or C, aiding in making appropriate treatment decisions.",2294
39613956,Validation of the Node Reporting and Data System (Node-RADS) for standardized CT evaluation of regional lymph nodes in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma patients.,European radiology,2025,"The accurate identification of positive lymph nodes in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) influences patient risk assessment and treatment decisions, but there is no standardized approach for radiological evaluation. The aim of this study was to verify the diagnostic performance of the new Node Reporting and Data System 1.0 (Node-RADS) in the assessment of lymph node metastasis in patients with ESCC, as verified by final histopathology. Node-RADS is a scoring system composed of different criteria for evaluating lymph node metastasis, with scores ranging from 1 to 5, corresponding to the degree of suspicion of lymph node involvement. In this single-center study, Node-RADS was used to retrospectively evaluate regional lymph nodes in 173 ESCC patients who underwent computed tomography (CT) before radical resection. In addition, the area under the ROC curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) were calculated for the Node-RADS score and individual criteria. Node-RADS outperformed the individual assessment criteria (AUC: 94.3%, sensitivity: 96.5%, specificity: 92.0%), with scores ≥ 3 indicating the maximum diagnostic effectiveness. The diagnostic efficiency of the highest Node-RADS score surpassed that of the short axis score (AUC: 94.3% vs. 81.9%, p < 0.001). Our results indicated that the best diagnostic cut-off points for the short axis, long axis and short axis/long axis ratio were 9 mm, 11 mm, and 0.74, respectively. Node-RADS has emerged as a practical, repetitive method for the early identification of high-risk metastatic lymph nodes, providing therapeutic guidance and predicting disease prognosis in ESCC patients. Question How does the Node Reporting and Data System 1.0 (Node-RADS) perform in the assessment of lymph node metastasis in patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC)? Findings The maximum diagnostic efficiency was achieved with a Node-RADS score of ≥ 3. Clinical relevance The Node-RADS has improved diagnostic efficiency for distinguishing lymph node metastasis in patients with ESCC.",2125
39613955,Ultrasound-guided high-intensity focused ultrasound for symptomatic uterine fibroids: clinical outcome of two European centers.,European radiology,2025,"The aim of this study is to assess the clinical outcome and mid-term efficacy of ultrasound-guided high-intensity focused ultrasound (USgHIFU) as a treatment for symptomatic uterine fibroids at two major European HIFU centers. This bi-center longitudinal clinical study involved the treatment of 100 patients with symptomatic uterine fibroids using USgHIFU (n = 59 in Germany, n = 41 in Bulgaria). Clinical outcomes were evaluated at 6 weeks, 6 months, and 1 year follow-up utilizing the uterine fibroid symptoms-quality of life questionnaire for fibroid-related symptoms and health-related quality of life as well as MRI imaging for determining the fibroid volume. The mean fibroid volume reduction rate was 33.2 ± 22.9%, 51.3 ± 24.2%, and 59.1 ± 28.0% at 6 weeks, 6 months, and 1 year, respectively (each p < 0.001). The mean symptom severity score decreased from 43.9 ± 18.8 at baseline to 35.4 ± 18.2 at 6 weeks, 31.1 ± 20.0 at 6 months, and 23.1 ± 14.0 at 1 year (each p < 0.001). The mean QOL score improved from 56.5 ± 23.4 at baseline to 65.4 ± 22.2 at 6 weeks, 72.5 ± 19.5 at 6 months, and 79.4 ± 15.3 at 1 year (each p < 0.001). No major complications were observed, though two patients experienced temporary sciatic nerve irritation following the procedure. Four patients had pregnancies and deliveries without any complications after USgHIFU therapy. To our knowledge, this is the first longitudinal study conducted in two major European HIFU centers that reveals the clinical efficacy of USgHIFU ablation on symptomatic uterine fibroids. Our results confirm that USgHIFU is a non-invasive approach with a low risk of complications, offering an innovative treatment option for affected women. Question To evaluate mid-term clinical efficacy and safety of US-guided high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) for treating symptomatic uterine fibroids and patient outcomes across two European centers. Findings US-guided HIFU treatment resulted in significant fibroid volume reduction (up to 59.1% after 1 year) improving symptoms and quality of life with no major complications. Clinical relevance This prospective longitudinal study provides preliminary data assessing mid-term efficacy and clinical outcomes of ultrasound-guided HIFU. It is shown to be a low-risk, non-invasive treatment option for symptomatic uterine fibroids that reduces fibroid size and improves patients' quality of life.",2404
39609284,PI-QUAL version 2 image quality categorisation and inter-reader agreement compared to version 1.,European radiology,2025,"Prostate imaging quality (PI-QUAL) was developed to standardise the evaluation of prostate MRI quality and has recently been updated to version 2. This study aims to assess inter-reader agreement for PI-QUAL v1 and v2 scores and investigates changes in MRI quality score categories. The study retrospectively analysed 350 multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) scans. Two expert uroradiologists independently assessed mpMRI quality using PI-QUAL v1 and v2 guidelines. Biparametric MRI (bpMRI) categorisation based on PI-QUAL v2 included only T2WI and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) results. Inter-reader agreement was determined using percentage agreement and kappa, and categorisation comparisons were made using the chi-square test. Substantial inter-reader agreement was observed for the overall PI-QUAL v1 score (κ = 0.64) and moderate agreement for v2 mpMRI (κ = 0.54) and v2 bpMRI scores (κ = 0.57). Inter-reader agreements on individual sequences were similar between v1 and v2 (kappa for individual sequences: T2WI, 0.46 and 0.49; DWI, 0.66 and 0.70; DCE, 0.71 and 0.61). Quality levels shifted from predominantly ""optimal"" in v1 (65%) down to ""acceptable"" using v2 (55%); p < 0.001. The addition of DCE increased the proportion of cases with at least ""adequate"" quality at mpMRI (64%) compared to bpMRI (30%); p < 0.001. This study shows consistent inter-reader agreement between PI-QUAL v1 and v2, encompassing overall and individual sequence categorisation. A notable shift from ""optimal"" to ""acceptable"" quality was demonstrated when moving from v1 to v2, with DCE tending improving quality from ""inadequate"" (bpMRI) to ""acceptable"" (mpMRI). Question What are the agreement levels of image quality of prostate MRI by using PI-QUAL v1 and v2? Findings Inter-reader agreement based on PI-QUAL v1 and v2 is comparable. Dynamic contrast enhancement (DCE) enables an overall shift from inadequate quality (at bpMRI) to acceptable quality (mpMRI). Clinical relevance The inter-reader agreement on PI-QUAL v1 and v2 is equivalent. PI-QUAL v2 assesses prostate bpMRI as well as mpMRI quality. Transitioning from inadequate to acceptable between v2-bpMRI and v2-mpMRI highlights the role of DCE as an ""image quality safety net.""",2222
39609282,Photon-counting detector CT provides superior subsolid nodule characterization compared to same-day energy-integrating detector CT.,European radiology,2025,"To investigate the image quality and the performance of photon-counting detector (PCD) CT compared to conventional energy-integrating detector (EID) CT in identifying subsolid nodule (SSN) characteristics. Participants with SSNs who underwent same-day EID CT and PCD CT between October 2023 and April 2024 were prospectively included. The 1.0 mm EID CT images and, subsequently, 1.0 mm, 0.4 mm, and 0.2 mm PCD CT images were reviewed to assess image noise and subjective image quality on a 5-point Likert scale. SSN characteristics, including lobulation, spiculation, pleural retraction, air cavities, intra-nodular vessel signs, internal vascular changes, and heterogeneous solid components, were evaluated. Additionally, a step-by-step observation and comparison method was used to determine the presence of any additional characteristics. Forty-eight participants (mean age: 56 ± 11 years; 16 males) with 89 SSNs were included. PCD CT significantly reduced radiation dose when using matched scans (1.79 ± 0.39 vs 2.17 ± 0.57 mSv, p < 0.001). Compared to 1.0 mm EID CT, 1.0 mm PCD CT images exhibited significantly lower objective image noise and higher subjective image quality (all p < 0.001). Compared to EID CT, PCD CT demonstrated enhanced visualization of subtle characteristics, except for lobulation, with a 0.4 mm section thickness offering a favorable balance between ultra-high resolution and perceived image quality for radiologists. PCD CT facilitated radiation dose reduction and outperformed conventional EID CT in terms of image quality and visualization of SSN characteristics. Question PCD CT, featuring ultra-high-resolution mode acquisition and a thinner reconstruction, has not been fully explored for characterizing SSNs. Findings Compared to EID CT, PCD CT was associated with lower objective image noise, higher subjective image quality, and superior SSN characterization. Clinical relevance PCD CT effectively reduced the radiation dose delivered to the patients and enabled more precise SSN characterization.",2036
39607450,Impact of intensity standardisation and ComBat batch size on clinical-radiomic prognostic models performance in a multi-centre study of patients with glioblastoma.,European radiology,2025,"To assess the effect of different intensity standardisation techniques (ISTs) and ComBat batch sizes on radiomics survival model performance and stability in a heterogenous, multi-centre cohort of patients with glioblastoma (GBM). Multi-centre pre-operative MRI acquired between 2014 and 2020 in patients with IDH-wildtype unifocal WHO grade 4 GBM were retrospectively evaluated. WhiteStripe (WS), Nyul histogram matching (HM), and Z-score (ZS) ISTs were applied before radiomic feature (RF) extraction. RFs were realigned using ComBat and minimum batch size (MBS) of 5, 10, or 15 patients. Cox proportional hazards models for overall survival (OS) prediction were produced using five different selection strategies and the impact of IST and MBS was evaluated using bootstrapping. Calibration, discrimination, relative explained variation, and model fit were assessed. Instability was evaluated using 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs), feature selection frequency and calibration curves across the bootstrap resamples. One hundred ninety-five patients were included. Median OS = 13 (95% CI: 12-14) months. Twelve to fourteen unique MRI protocols were used per MRI sequence. HM and WS produced the highest relative increase in model discrimination, explained variation and model fit but IST choice did not greatly impact on stability, nor calibration. Larger ComBat batches improved discrimination, model fit, and explained variation but higher MBS (reduced sample size) reduced stability (across all performance metrics) and reduced calibration accuracy. Heterogenous, real-world GBM data poses a challenge to the reproducibility of radiomics. ComBat generally improved model performance as MBS increased but reduced stability and calibration. HM and WS tended to improve model performance. Question ComBat harmonisation of RFs and intensity standardisation of MRI have not been thoroughly evaluated in multicentre, heterogeneous GBM data. Findings The addition of ComBat and ISTs can improve discrimination, relative model fit, and explained variance but degrades the calibration and stability of survival models. Clinical relevance Radiomics risk prediction models in real-world, multicentre contexts could be improved by ComBat and ISTs, however, this degrades calibration and prediction stability and this must be thoroughly investigated before patients can be accurately separated into different risk groups.",2414

This prospective study enrolled 977 consecutive women with suspected AMs from three institutions between January 2022 and December 2023. Ultrasound examinations were performed by three experienced radiologists who categorized AMs according to O-RADS ultrasound v2019. The same radiologists retrospectively reviewed the stored ultrasound images and provided the O-RADS ultrasound v2022 classification. Histopathology was used as the reference standard to calculate the diagnostic accuracy of the O-RADS versions in predicting malignant AMs. Inter-observer agreement (IOA) of the O-RADS scoring results was evaluated using the Fleiss kappa (κ) test. The final analysis included 803 women with 855 AMs (219 (25.6%) malignant and 636 (74.4%) benign). Both O-RADS versions demonstrated good diagnostic accuracy, with area under the curve (AUC) values ranging from 0.906 to 0.923 (v2019) and 0.919 to 0.936 (v2022). The updated v2022 showed a slightly higher accuracy (82.5-86.7% vs. 80.7-85.3%), sensitivity (93.6-95.0% vs. 92.2-94.1%), and specificity (78.1-84.1% vs. 76.1-82.9%) compared to v2019. The IOA for the overall O-RADS classification was perfect for both versions (κ = 0.96-0.97). The O-RADS ultrasound classification system demonstrated good diagnostic accuracy and reliability in predicting malignant AMs, with the updated v2022 showing modest improvements. Question Accurate classification of adnexal masses is essential for management. Can updated O-RADS ultrasound v2022 improve diagnostic accuracy and reliability compared to v2019 in predicting malignancies? Findings O-RADS ultrasound v2022 demonstrated slightly higher diagnostic accuracy for identifying malignant adnexal masses compared to v2019, reflecting modest improvements in risk stratification and clinical decision-making.

39604651,Radiomic features add incremental benefit to conventional radiological feature-based differential diagnosis of lung nodules.,European radiology,2025,"To investigate the incremental benefit of adding radiomic features to conventional semantic radiological feature-based differential diagnosis between benign and malignant lung nodules. From May 2017 to March 2021, 393 patients with 465 pathologically confirmed lung nodules were enrolled with 54 patients with 54 lung nodules as external testing. Based on manually segmented lung nodules, 1409 radiomics features were extracted. Sixteen radiological features were obtained. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) was used to select the most informative features from the two features set separately. Support vector machine (SVM) and logistic regression (LR) were used to build the models (radiomics model, radiological model, and combined model) with performance compared using the DeLong test. After feature selection, six radiological features, including shape, vascular convergence sign (type III), margin, density, pleural traction sign, and spiculation, and nine radiomics features were selected. In the independent testing and external testing, combined models had significantly higher AUCs than the corresponding radiomic models for both the SVM classifier (AUC: 0.871 vs. 0.773, p = 0.029; 0.810 vs. 0.706, p = 0.037) and LR classifier (AUC: 0.871 vs. 0.742, p = 0.008; 0.828 vs. 0.712, p = 0.044), and the corresponding radiological model for both the SVM classifier (AUC: 0.871 vs. 0.803, p = 0.015; 0.810 vs. 0.730, p = 0.045) and LR classifier (AUC: 0.871 vs. 0.818, p = 0.034; 0.828 vs. 0.756, p = 0.040). Radiomics features could add incremental benefits to the conventional radiological feature-based differential diagnosis. Question Conventional semantic radiological feature-based differential diagnosis between benign and malignant lung nodules needs further improvement.

Single-center retrospective analysis (2017-2020) of APTwi in 156 patients (84 men, mean age: 50.9 ± 20) who underwent characterization imaging of a brain mass prior to any treatment, using 3-Tesla MRI. 125/156 (80%) patients presented with brain tumor and 31/156 (20%) with tumor mimics. Regions of interest were manually drawn on 2D axial slices by two readers on APTwi map in lesional and perilesional areas and APT-SI, corresponding to the Magnetization Transfer Ratio asymmetry at 3.5 ppm, was systematically reported. Student's t-test or Wilcoxon-test were used to compare groups of patients. The mean APT-SI in lesional and perilesional areas were significantly higher in tumors compared to tumor mimics: 3% [2.10-4] (median [Q1-Q3]) vs 1.7% [0.80-2.55] (p < 0.001) and 1.9% [1.2-2.80] vs. 1.0% [0.55-2.3] (p < 0.01). There were no differences in mean APT-SI in the tumor core between low and high-grade tumors: 2.5% [1.80-4.0] vs. 3.25% [2.5-4.0]. The mean APT-SI was significantly higher in high-grade glioma compared to low-grade glioma: 3.4% [2.7-4] vs. 2.1% [1.7-2.5] (p < 0.001). Highest mean APT-SI in tumor core were found in mesenchymal tumors (5.83% ± 1.45, mean ± SD), embryonal tumors (5.27% ± 3.5) and meningiomas (4.28% ± 0.70). In tumor mimics, highest mean APT-SI was found in the core of infectious lesions (3.52% ± 0.67). High signal on ATPwi is not exclusive to high-grade brain tumors but can be observed in some tumor mimics and subtypes of low-grade tumors. Question What is the value of amide proton transfer-weighted imaging (APTwi) in the setting of brain mass classification? Findings High APT-signal intensity in the tumor core of a brain mass could correspond to a high- or low-grade tumor or tumor mimic. Clinical relevance In patients presenting for the initial classification of brain masses, APTwi findings should be interpreted with caution and in conjunction with other MRI parameters, as a high APTwi signal does not necessarily indicate a high-grade tumor.",2218

39576686,Liver elastography-based risk score for predicting hepatocellular carcinoma risk.,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,2025,"Liver stiffness measurement (LSM) via vibration-controlled transient elastography accurately assesses fibrosis. We aimed to develop a universal risk score for predicting hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development in patients with chronic hepatitis. We systematically selected predictors and developed the risk prediction model (HCC-LSM) in the hepatitis B virus (HBV) training cohort (n = 2251, median follow-up of 3.2 years). The HCC-LSM model was validated in an independent HBV validation cohort (n = 1191, median follow-up of 5.7 years) and a non-viral chronic liver disease (CLD) extrapolation cohort (n = 1189, median follow-up of 3.3 years). An HCC risk score was then constructed based on a nomogram. An online risk evaluation tool Liver Elastography-Based Hepatocellular Carcinoma Risk Score (LEBER) was developed using ChatGPT4.0. Eight routinely available predictors were identified, with LSM levels showing a significant dose-response relationship with HCC incidence (P < .001 by log-rank test). The HCC-LSM model exhibited excellent predictive performance in the HBV training cohort (C-index = 0.866) and the HBV validation cohort (C-index = 0.852), with good performance in the extrapolation CLD cohort (C-index = 0.769). The model demonstrated significantly superior discrimination compared to 6 previous models across the 3 cohorts.

A total of 433 HBV-infected HCC patients were enrolled in this retrospective study. Survival data were analyzed using Cox regression analyses, and lipidomics was used to study HCC tissue composition. Logistic regression identified an independent predictor for HBV-SHHCC, and receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analysis verified its discrimination. HBV-SHHCC patients had longer disease-free survival (DFS, p < 0.0001) and overall survival (OS) time (p = 0.00097). Compared with common HCC (cHCC), SHHCC was associated with significantly higher mean triacylglyceride (p = 0.010) and diacylglyceride contents (p = 0.002) in tumor tissues. Fat fraction (FF) was linearly correlated with lipid composition and fatty acid degradation (FAD) subtype, which could help in treatment options for HCC. The univariate and multivariate logistic regression indicated FF (p < 0.001) as an independent predictor for diagnosing this phenotype. ROC analysis confirmed excellent discrimination (area under the curve (AUC), 0.914; sensitivity, 92.3%; specificity, 78.7.0%). After using the optimal cutoff point, the DFS time of patients with SHHCC stratified by FF was significantly higher than that of patients with cHCC. The biological behavior and prognosis of HBV-SHHCC were better than those of other types. FF is a valuable tool for the clinical diagnosis of SHHCC, prognosis prediction, and treatment guidance in patients with HCC. Question Can the diagnosis of steatohepatitic hepatocellular carcinoma (SHHCC) be made noninvasively? Findings Fat fraction (FF) correlated with lipid composition and could be used to diagnose SHHCC with an AUC of 0.914, sensitivity of 92.3%, and specificity of 78.7%.

39565901,Projected outcomes of reduced-biopsy management of Grade Group 1 prostate cancer: implications for relabeling.,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,2025,"Implications of relabeling Grade Group 1 prostate cancer as noncancer will depend on the recommended active surveillance strategy. Whether relabeling should prompt deintensifying, prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-based active monitoring approaches is unclear. We investigated outcomes of biopsy-based active surveillance strategies vs PSA-based active monitoring for Grade Group 1 diagnoses under different patient adherence rates. We analyzed longitudinal PSA levels and time to Grade Group 2 or higher reclassification among 850 patients with a diagnosis of Grade Group 1 disease from the Canary Prostate Active Surveillance Study (2008-2013). We then simulated 20 000 patients over 12 years, comparing Grade Group 2 or higher detection under biennial biopsy against 3 PSA-based strategies: (1) PSA (biopsy for PSA change ≥20% per year), (2) PSA plus magnetic resonance imaging (magnetic resonance imaging for PSA change ≥20% per year and biopsy for Prostate Imaging Reporting & Data System ≥3), and (3) predicted risk (biopsy for predicted upgrading risk ≥10%). Under biennial biopsies and 20% dropout to active treatment, 17% of patients had a 2-year or longer delay in Grade Group 2 or higher detection. The PSA strategy reduced the number of biopsies by 39% but delayed detection in 32% of patients. The PSA plus magnetic resonance imaging strategy reduced the number of biopsies by 52%, with a 34% delay. The predicted risk strategy reduced the number of biopsies by 31%, with only an 8% delay. These findings are robust to biopsy sensitivity and confirmatory biopsy. Prostate-specific antigen-based active monitoring could substantially reduce biopsy frequency; however, a precision strategy based on an individual upgrading risk is most likely to minimize delays in detection of disease progression. This strategy may be preferred if active surveillance is deintensified under relabeling, provided patient adherence remains unaffected.",1943
39560714,Minimally interactive segmentation of soft-tissue tumors on CT and MRI using deep learning.,European radiology,2025,"Segmentations are crucial in medical imaging for morphological, volumetric, and radiomics biomarkers. Manual segmentation is accurate but not feasible in clinical workflow, while automatic segmentation generally performs sub-par. To develop a minimally interactive deep learning-based segmentation method for soft-tissue tumors (STTs) on CT and MRI. The interactive method requires the user to click six points near the tumor's extreme boundaries in the image. These six points are transformed into a distance map and serve, with the image, as input for a convolutional neural network. A multi-center public dataset with 514 patients and nine STT phenotypes in seven anatomical locations, with CT or T1-weighted MRI, was used for training and internal validation. For external validation, another public dataset was employed, which included five unseen STT phenotypes in extremities on CT, T1-weighted MRI, and T2-weighted fat-saturated (FS) MRI. Internal validation resulted in a dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 0.85 ± 0.11 (mean ± standard deviation) for CT and 0.84 ± 0.12 for T1-weighted MRI. External validation resulted in DSCs of 0.81 ± 0.08 for CT, 0.84 ± 0.09 for T1-weighted MRI, and 0.88 ± 0.08 for T2-weighted FS MRI. Volumetric measurements showed consistent replication with low error internally (volume: 1 ± 28 mm The minimally interactive segmentation method effectively segments STT phenotypes on CT and MRI, with robust generalization to unseen phenotypes and imaging modalities. Question Can this deep learning-based method segment soft-tissue tumors faster than can be done manually and more accurately than other automatic methods? Findings The minimally interactive segmentation method achieved accurate segmentation results in internal and external validation, and generalized well across soft-tissue tumor phenotypes and imaging modalities. Clinical relevance This minimally interactive deep learning-based segmentation method could reduce the burden of manual segmentation, facilitate the integration of imaging-based biomarkers (e.g., radiomics) into clinical practice, and provide a fast, semi-automatic solution for volume and diameter measurements (e.g., RECIST).",2197
39560480,Deep Learning Algorithms for Breast Cancer Detection in a UK Screening Cohort: As Stand-alone Readers and Combined with Human Readers.,Radiology,2024,"Background Deep learning (DL) algorithms have shown promising results in mammographic screening either compared to a single reader or, when deployed in conjunction with a human reader, compared with double reading. Purpose To externally validate the performance of three DL algorithms as mammographic screen readers in an independent UK data set. Materials and Methods Three commercial DL algorithms (DL-1, DL-2, and DL-3) were retrospectively investigated from January 2022 to June 2022 using consecutive full-field digital mammograms collected at two UK sites during 1 year (2017). Normal cases with 3-year follow-up and histopathologically proven cancer cases detected either at screening (that round or next) or within the 3-year interval were included. A preset specificity threshold equivalent to a single reader was applied. Performance was evaluated for stand-alone DL reading compared with single human reading, and for DL reading combined with human reading compared with double reading, using sensitivity and specificity as the primary metrics.

39545979,Misdiagnosis in breast imaging: a statement paper from European Society Breast Imaging (EUSOBI)-Part 2: Main causes of errors in breast imaging and recommendations from European Society of Breast Imaging to limit misdiagnosis.,European radiology,2025,"Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of negligence claims in radiology. The objective of this document is to describe the specific main causes of errors in breast imaging and provide European Society of Breast Imaging (EUSOBI) recommendations to try to minimize these. Technical failures represent 17% of all mammographic diagnostic negligence claims. Mammography quality control protocol and dedicated training for technologists and radiologists are essential. Lack of consideration of the clinical context is a second critical issue, as a clinical abnormality is found in 80% of malpractice claims. EUSOBI emphasizes the importance of communication and clinical examination before the diagnostic investigation. Detection errors or misapplications of the lexicon or Breast Imaging Reporting Data System (BI-RADS) score account for 5% of malpractice claims and should be reduced by limiting radiologists' distraction or fatigue, and being aware of satisfaction of search errors and the importance of a personal systematic review. Errors related to pathological concordance and MDT review can be limited by the use of markers after biopsy and the use of standardized reports, which can aid communication with other specialities. Finally, errors related to tumor or patient factors should be discussed, considering the use of contrast-enhanced mammography and magnetic resonance imaging. Several factors are responsible for misdiagnosis in breast cancer, including errors in the practice of the technician and/or radiologist (technical failures, lack of consideration of the clinical context, incorrect application of the BI-RADS score, false reassurances), lack of communication with other specialists or with the patient, and the type of tumor and breast parenchyma. Question What factors most contribute to and what implications stem from misdiagnosis in breast imaging? Findings Ongoing training and education for radiologists and other healthcare providers, as well as interdisciplinary collaboration and communication is paramount. Clinical relevance Misdiagnosis in breast imaging can have significant implications for patients, healthcare providers, and the entire healthcare system.",2195
39545978,Misdiagnosis in breast imaging: a statement paper from European Society Breast Imaging (EUSOBI)-Part 1: The role of common errors in radiology in missed breast cancer and implications of misdiagnosis.,European radiology,2025,"Misdiagnosis in breast imaging can have significant implications for patients, healthcare providers, and the healthcare system as a whole. Some of the potential implications of misdiagnosis in breast imaging include delayed diagnosis or false reassurance, which can result in a delay in treatment and potentially a worse prognosis. Misdiagnosis can also lead to unnecessary procedures, which can cause physical discomfort, anxiety, and emotional distress for patients, as well as increased healthcare costs. All these events can erode patient trust in the healthcare system and in individual healthcare providers. This can have negative implications for patient compliance with screening and treatment recommendations, as well as overall health outcomes. Moreover, misdiagnosis can also result in legal consequences for healthcare providers, including medical malpractice lawsuits and disciplinary action by licensing boards. To minimize the risk of misdiagnosis in breast imaging, it is important for healthcare providers to use appropriate imaging techniques and interpret images accurately and consistently. This requires ongoing training and education for radiologists and other healthcare providers, as well as collaboration and communication among healthcare providers to ensure that patients receive appropriate and timely care. If a misdiagnosis does occur, it is important for healthcare providers to communicate with patients and provide appropriate follow-up care to minimize the potential implications of the misdiagnosis. This may include repeat imaging, additional biopsies or other procedures, and referral to specialists for further evaluation and management. Question What factors most contribute to and what implications stem from misdiagnosis in breast imaging? Findings Ongoing training and education for radiologists and other healthcare providers, as well as interdisciplinary collaboration and communication, is paramount.

39541785,Radiomic features of primary retroperitoneal sarcomas: a prognostic study.,"European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",2024,"Risk-stratification of patients with retroperitoneal sarcomas (RPS) relies on validated nomograms, such as Sarculator. This retrospective study investigated whether radiomic features extracted from computed tomography (CT) imaging could i) enhance the performance of Sarculator and ii) identify G3 dedifferentiated liposarcoma (DDLPS) or leiomyosarcoma (LMS), which are currently consider in a randomized clinical trial testing neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Patients with primary localized RPS treated with curative-intent surgery (2011-2015) and available pre-operative CT imaging were included. Regions of interest (ROIs) were manually annotated on both unenhanced and portal venous phase acquisitions. Top performing radiomic features were selected with outcome-specific random forest models, through generation of replicative experiments (contexts) where patients were split into training and testing sets. Endpoints were overall and disease-free survival (OS, DFS). Prognostic models for DFS and OS included the top five selected radiomic features and the Sarculator nomogram score. Models accuracy was assessed with Harrell's Concordance (C-)index. The study included 112 patients, with a median follow-up of 77 months (IQR 65-92 months). Sarculator alone achieved a C-index of 0.622 and 0.686 for DFS and OS, respectively. Radiomic features only marginally enhanced the prediction accuracy of Sarculator for OS (C-index=0.726, C-index gain: 0.04) or DFS (C-index=0.639, C-index gain: 0.017). Finally, radiomic features identified patients with G3 DDLPS or LMS with an accuracy of 0.806. Radiomic features marginally improved the performance of Sarculator in RPS. However, they accurately identified G3 DDLPS or LMS at diagnosis, potentially improving patients selection for neoadjuvant treatments.",1800
39535738,An Artificial Intelligence-Driven Preoperative Radiomic Subtype for Predicting the Prognosis and Treatment Response of Patients with Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,2025,"From 8% to 28% of patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) experience recurrence, complicating risk stratification and treatment. We previously identified an inflammatory molecular subtype of PTC associated with poor prognosis. Based on this subtype, we aimed to develop and validate a noninvasive radiomic signature to predict prognosis and treatment response in patients with PTC. We collected preoperative ultrasound images from two large independent centers (n = 2,506) to develop and validate a deep learning radiomics signature of inflammation (DLRI) for predicting the inflammatory subtype of PTC, including its correlation with prognosis and anti-inflammatory traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) treatment. Training set 1 (n = 64) and internal validation set 2 (n = 1,108) were from Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital. External validation sets 1 (n = 76) and 2 (n = 1,258) were from Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center. We developed a DLRI to accurately predict PTC's inflammatory subtype (AUC = 0.97 in training set 1 and AUC = 0.82 in external validation set 1). High-risk DLRI was significantly associated with poor disease-free survival in the first cohort [HR = 16.49, 95% confidence interval (CI), 7.92-34.35, P < 0.001] and second cohort (HR = 5.42, 95% CI, 3.67-8.02, P < 0.001). The DLRI independently predicted disease-free survival, irrespective of clinicopathologic variables (P < 0.001 for all). Furthermore, patients with high-risk DLRI were likely to benefit from anti-inflammatory TCM treatment (HR = 0.19, 95% CI, 0.06-0.55, P = 0.002), whereas those with low-risk DLRI did not. DLRI is a reliable noninvasive tool for evaluating prognosis and guiding anti-inflammatory TCM treatment in patients with PTC. Prospective studies are needed to confirm these findings.",1820

Patients diagnosed with LAGC by postoperative pathology who underwent abdominal triple-phase enhanced spectral computed tomography (CT) were prospectively enrolled in this study between June 2023 and December 2023. All the patients were categorized into intestinal- and diffuse-type groups according to the Lauren classification. Traditional characteristics, including demographic information, serum tumor markers, gastroscopic pathology, and image semantic features, were collected. Spectral quantitative parameters, including iodine concentration (IC), effective atomic number (Zeff), and slope of the energy spectrum curve from 40 keV to 70 keV (λ), were measured three times for each patient by two blinded radiologists in arterial/venous/delayed phases (AP/VP/DP). Differences in traditional features and spectral quantitative parameters between the two groups were compared using univariable analysis. Independent predictors of the Lauren classification of LAGC were screened using multivariable logistic regression analysis. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to assess the discriminating capability. Ultimately, the nomogram, including clinical features and spectral CT quantitative parameters, was developed. Gender, nIC in AP (APnIC), and λ in DP (λd) were independent predictors for Lauren classification. The nomogram based on these indicators produced the best performance with an area under the curve of 0.841 (95% confidence interval: 0.749-0.932), specificity of 85.3%, accuracy of 76.4%, and sensitivity of 68.4%. The nomogram based on clinical features and spectral CT quantitative parameters exhibits great potential in the preoperative and non-invasive assessment of Lauren classification for LAGC. Question Can the proposed nomogram, integrating clinical features and spectral quantitative parameters, preoperatively predict the Lauren classification in locally advanced gastric cancer (LAGC)? Findings The nomogram, based on gender, arterial phase normalized iodine concentration, and slope of the energy spectrum curve in the delayed phase showed satisfactory predictive ability. Clinical relevance The established nomogram could contribute to guiding individualized treatment strategies and risk stratification in patients by predicting the Lauren classification for LAGC before surgery.",2522
39532721,MRI findings of newly present benign focal hepatic observations following chemotherapy: distinct features in early- and late-term follow-up.,European radiology,2025,"To evaluate gadoxetic acid-enhanced (Gd-EOB-DTPA) MRI features of newly detected benign focal hepatic observations after chemotherapy. In this retrospective single-center case-control study, we enrolled a cohort of 43 cancer patients with 93 newly detected benign focal hepatic observations after chemotherapy between January 2010 and December 2020. We evaluated several parameters including the delay of occurrence after chemotherapy, imaging features, and imaging follow-up. These parameters were compared with those observed in a control group comprising 34 patients with 93 hepatic metastases. For focal hepatic observations occurring at early-term follow-up (delay of occurrence after chemotherapy, median 3 months, range 1-6 months) with 22 patients encompassing 45 lesions, most lesions exhibited an ill-defined margin on HBP images (64.4%), negative on diffusion-weighted images (84.4%), mottled hypo-intensity on hepatobiliary phase images (88.9%), and undistorted vessels traversing the lesions (80.0%). Follow-up imaging indicated that 91.9% of these lesions resolved within 4-20 months. For focal hepatic observations occurring at late-term follow-up (delay of occurrence after chemotherapy, median 34 months, range 12-60 months) with 21 patients encompassing 48 lesions, which were diagnosed as focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH)-like lesions based on MRI features. A hepatobiliary ring enhancement was observed in 56.3% of lesions, and 66.7% of patients showed an increase in lesion size and/or number during follow-up imaging. Focal hepatic observations occurring at early-term and late-term follow-ups after chemotherapy have distinctive imaging features at Gd-EOB-DTPA-MRI. Early-term focal observations tend to resolve spontaneously, whereas FNH-like lesions can increase in size and number during follow-up. Question Focal benign liver lesions related to chemotherapy-induced hepatic injury were reported in recent years, often leading to confusion with metastasis and resulting in misdiagnosis. Findings Chemotherapy-induced focal hepatic observations identified during early- and late-term follow-up exhibit distinct imaging characteristics on Gd-EOB-DTPA-MRI and demonstrate varying temporal changes. Clinical relevance Chemotherapy-induced hepatic observations can be differentiated from metastasis based on Gd-EOB-DTPA MRI findings and their temporal changes. A deeper understanding of their findings can avoid unnecessary biopsies or surgical resections.",2476

Purpose To analyze clinical digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) screening data to evaluate changes in reader performance during sequential batch reading. Materials and Methods This observational retrospective study used data from the radiology information system collected for screening DBT examinations performed from January 2018 to December 2019. The reference standard was established based on pathology results, if applicable, or imaging findings at 1-year follow-up. Examinations were aggregated into batches, defined as a sequence of cases for a given reader with differences in interexamination time of 10 minutes or less. Mixed-effect models were used to evaluate performance and timing across batch positions. Statistical adjustments accounted for potential confounders, including patient characteristics (age, breast density), reading factors (day of week, time of day), and between-reader heterogeneity. Results The dataset included 121 652 examinations (median patient age, 61 years [IQR, 53-69 years]), including 1081 cancers interpreted by 15 radiologists. Unadjusted false-positive rates decreased from an averaged 15.5% at the first within-batch examination to 10.5% after three sequentially read examinations (",1405
39528755,Predicting post-hepatectomy liver failure in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma: nomograms based on deep learning analysis of gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI.,European radiology,2025,"This study aimed to develop nomograms for predicting post-hepatectomy liver failure (PHLF) in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), using deep learning analysis of Gadoxetic acid-enhanced hepatobiliary (HBP) MRI. This retrospective study analyzed patients who underwent gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI and hepatectomy for HCC between 2016 and 2020 at two referral centers. Using a deep learning algorithm, volumes and signal intensities of whole non-tumor liver, expected remnant liver, and spleen were measured on HBP images. Two multivariable logistic regression models were formulated to predict PHLF, defined and graded by the International Study Group of Liver Surgery: one based on whole non-tumor liver measurements (whole liver model) and the other on expected remnant liver measurements (remnant liver model). The models were presented as nomograms and a web-based calculator. Discrimination performance was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating curve (AUC), with internal validation through 1000-fold bootstrapping. The study included 1760 patients (1395 male; mean age ± standard deviation, 60 ± 10 years), with 137 (7.8%) developing PHLF. Nomogram predictors included sex, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, prothrombin time international normalized ratio, platelets, extent of liver resection, and MRI variables derived from the liver volume, liver-to-spleen signal intensity ratio, and spleen volume. The whole liver and the remnant liver nomograms demonstrated strong predictive performance for PHLF (optimism-corrected AUC of 0.78 and 0.81, respectively) and symptomatic (grades B and C) PHLF (optimism-corrected AUC of 0.81 and 0.84, respectively). Nomograms based on deep learning analysis of gadoxetic acid-enhanced HBP images accurately stratify the risk of PHLF. Question Can PHLF be predicted by integrating clinical and MRI-derived volume and functional variables through deep learning analysis of gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI? Findings Whole liver and remnant liver nomograms demonstrated strong predictive performance for PHLF with the optimism-corrected area under the curve of 0.78 and 0.81, respectively. Clinical relevance These nomograms can effectively stratify the risk of PHLF, providing a valuable tool for treatment decisions regarding hepatectomy for HCC.",2306

39514403,Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Enables In Vivo Quantification of PD-L1 Expression and Intertumoral Heterogeneity.,Cancer research,2025,"Patient selection for cancer immunotherapy requires precise, quantitative readouts of biomarker expression in intact tumors that can be reliably compared across multiple subjects over time. The current clinical standard biomarker for assessing immunotherapy response is PD-L1 expression, typically quantified using IHC. This method, however, only provides snapshots of PD-L1 expression status in microscopic regions of ex vivo specimens. Although various targeted probes have been investigated for in vivo imaging of PD-L1, nonspecific probe accumulation within the tumor microenvironment has hindered accurate quantification, limiting the utility for preclinical and clinical studies. Here, we demonstrated that in vivo time-domain fluorescence imaging of an anti-PD-L1 antibody tagged with the near-infrared fluorophore IRDye 800CW (αPDL1-800) can yield quantitative estimates of baseline tumor PD-L1 heterogeneity across untreated mice, as well as variations in PD-L1 expression in mice undergoing clinically relevant anti-PD-1 treatment. The fluorescence lifetime (FLT) of PD-L1-bound αPDL1-800 was significantly longer than the FLT of nonspecifically accumulated αPDL1-800 in the tumor microenvironment. This FLT contrast allowed quantification of PD-L1 expression across mice both in superficial breast tumors using planar FLT imaging and in deep-seated liver tumors (>5 mm depth) using the asymptotic time-domain algorithm for fluorescence tomography. These findings suggest that FLT imaging can accelerate the preclinical investigation and clinical translation of new immunotherapy treatments by enabling robust quantification of receptor expression across subjects. Significance: Fluorescence lifetime imaging can quantify PD-L1 expression across multiple mice undergoing anti-PD-1 treatment, providing a critically needed noninvasive imaging method to quantify immunotherapy targets in vivo.",1901
39514025,Influence of endoxifen on mammographic density: results from the KARISMA-Tam trial.,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,2025,"Monitoring metabolites of tamoxifen, such as endoxifen, has been suggested as a strategy to ascertain therapeutic effect of tamoxifen therapy, but clinical guidelines are missing. Herein, we aim to investigate the outcome of endoxifen concentrations of low-dose tamoxifen, using change in mammographic breast density as a proxy for therapy response. In the randomized KARISMA-Tam (Karolinska Mammography project for risk prediction of breast cancer -Intervention Study with Tamoxifen) trial, including 5 doses of tamoxifen, measurements of plasma endoxifen concentrations, determination of CYP2D6 metabolizer status, and mammographic breast density change over the trial period were carried out. Association between endoxifen concentrations and relative mammographic breast density change after 6 months treatment was analyzed using linear regression in a spline model. A total of 824 women (335 premenopausal, 489 postmenopausal) were included. In analyses of premenopausal women, a spline model described a mammographic breast density decrease, equivalent to the mean (-18.5%) seen in women exposed to 20 mg tamoxifen, at endoxifen concentrations of 2-3 ng/mL. The mammographic breast density decrease reached a nadir at endoxifen levels of 3 ng/mL and did not decrease further at higher endoxifen concentrations. Most intermediate and normal tamoxifen metabolizers (about 90% of all participants) reached an endoxifen concentration of more than 2 ng/mL at tamoxifen doses of 5 and 10 mg. No mammographic breast density decrease was seen in the postmenopausal group. We have identified a possible window of effect on mammographic breast density at endoxifen concentrations of 2-3 ng/mL in premenopausal women, which corresponds to the doses of 5 and 10 mg tamoxifen. Because mammographic breast density change was used as a surrogate marker for therapy response, results should be confirmed using clinically established outcomes measures.",1940

Barrett's esophagus increases the risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma. The aim of this study was to investigate the ability of EMI-137, a mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor (c-MET)-targeting optical imaging tracer, to detect dysplasia in Barrett's esophagus. c-MET expression in human esophageal tissue was investigated using Gene Expression Omnibus datasets, tissue microarrays, and Barrett's esophagus biopsies. EMI-137 was tested in a dual xenograft mouse model bearing OE33 (c-MET high expression) and FLO-1 (c-MET low expression) tumors. Fluorescence molecular endoscopy was performed in a mouse model of Barrett's-like metaplasia and dysplasia (L2-IL1β). Tumors and organs of interest were evaluated through ex vivo fluorescence imaging. MET mRNA expression analyses and c-MET immunostaining confirmed upregulation of c-MET in Barrett's esophagus and esophageal adenocarcinoma compared with normal epithelium. There was strong accumulation of EMI-137 in OE33 xenografts 3 hours after injection, decreasing by more than 50% on coinjection of a 10-fold molar excess of unlabeled EMI-137. The target-to-background ratio at 3 hours after injection for OE33 and FLO-1 tumors was 10.08 and 1.42, respectively. Fluorescence molecular endoscopy of L2-IL1β mice showed uptake of EMI-137 in dysplastic lesions within Barrett's esophagus with a target-to-background ratio of 1.9 in vivo and greater than 2 in ex vivo fluorescence imaging. EMI-137 accumulates in dysplastic lesions within Barrett's esophagus and also in c-MET-positive esophageal adenocarcinoma.

39505735,Inter-reader agreement of the BI-RADS CEM lexicon.,European radiology,2025,"The purpose of this study was to assess the inter-reader agreement of the breast imaging reporting and data system (BI-RADS) contrast-enhanced mammography (CEM) lexicon. In this IRB-approved, single-center, retrospective study, three breast radiologists, each with different levels of experience, reviewed 462 lesions in 421 routine clinical CEM according to the fifth edition of the BI-RADS lexicon for mammography and to the first version of the BI-RADS lexicon for CEM. Readers were blinded to patient outcomes and evaluated breast and lesion features on low-energy (LE) images (breast density, type of lesion, associated architectural distortion), lesion features on recombined (RC) images (type of enhancement, characteristic of mass enhancement, non-mass enhancement or enhancing asymmetry), and provided a final BI-RADS assessment. The inter-reader agreement was calculated for each evaluated feature using Fleiss' kappa coefficient. Sensitivity and specificity were calculated. The inter-reader agreement was moderate to substantial for breast density (ĸ = 0.569), type of lesion on LE images (ĸ = 0.654), and type of enhancement (ĸ = 0.664). There was a moderate to substantial agreement on CEM mass enhancement descriptors. The agreement was fair to moderate for non-mass enhancement and enhancing asymmetry descriptors. Inter-reader agreement for LE and LE with RC BI-RADS assessment was moderate (ĸ = 0.421) and fair (ĸ = 0.364). Diagnostic performance was good and comparable for all readers. Inter-reader agreement of the CEM lexicon was moderate to substantial for most features. There was a low agreement for some RC descriptors, such as non-mass enhancement and enhancing asymmetry, and BI-RADS assessment, but this did not impact the diagnostic performance. Question Data on the reproducibility and inter-reader agreement for the first version of the BI-RADS lexicon dedicated to CEM are missing. Finding The inter-reader agreement for the lexicon was overall substantial to moderate, but it was lower for the descriptors for non-mass enhancement and enhancing asymmetry. Clinical relevance A common lexicon simplifies communication between specialists in clinical practice. The good inter-reader agreement confirms the effectiveness of the CEM-BIRADS in ensuring consistent communication. Detailed definitions of some descriptors (non-mass, enhancing asymmetry) are needed to ensure higher agreements.",2420
39505734,"Node-RADS: a systematic review and meta-analysis of diagnostic performance, category-wise malignancy rates, and inter-observer reliability.",European radiology,2025,"To perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to estimate diagnostic performance, category-wise malignancy rates, and inter-observer reliability of Node Reporting and Data System 1.0 (Node-RADS). Five electronic databases were systematically searched for primary studies on the use of Node-RADS to report the possibility of cancer involvement of lymph nodes on CT and MRI from January 1, 2021, until April 15, 2024. The study quality was assessed by modified Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) and Quality Appraisal of Diagnostic Reliability (QAREL) tools. The diagnostic accuracy was estimated with bivariate random-effects model, while the pooled category-wise malignancy rates were obtained with random-effects model. Six Node-RADS-CT studies and three Node-RADS-MRI studies covering nine types of cancer were included. The study quality was mainly damaged by inappropriate index test and unknown timing according to QUADAS-2, and unclear blindness during the rating process according to QAREL. The area under hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic curve (95% conventional interval) was 0.92 (0.89-0.94) for Node-RADS ≥ 3 as positive and 0.91 (0.88-0.93) for Node-RADS ≥ 4 as positive, respectively. The pooled malignancy rates (95% CIs) of Node-RADS 1 to 5 were 4% (0-10%), 31% (9-58%), 55% (34-75%), 89% (73-99%), and 100% (97-100%), respectively. The inter-observer reliability of five studies was interpreted as fair to substantial. Node-RADS presented a promising diagnostic performance with an increasing probability of malignancy along higher category. However, the evidence for inter-observer reliability of Node-RADS is insufficient, and may hinder its implementation in clinical practice for lymph node assessment. Question Node-RADS is designed for structured reporting of the possibility of cancer involvement of lymph nodes, but the evidence supporting its application has not been summarized. Findings Node-RADS presented diagnostic performance with AUC of 0.92, and malignancy rates for categories 1-5 ranged from 4% to 100%, while the inter-observer reliability was unclear. Clinical relevance Node-RADS is a useful tool for structured reporting of the possibility of cancer involvement of lymph nodes with high diagnostic performance and appropriate malignancy rate for each category, but unclear inter-observer reliability may hinder its implementation in clinical practice.",2440
39500800,CT feature of irregular extensive ulceration as a predictor of liver metastasis in gastric gastrointestinal stromal tumours.,European radiology,2025,"This study aimed to investigate whether the computed tomography (CT) finding of irregular extensive ulceration (IEU) can serve as a predictor of liver metastasis (LIM) in patients with gastric gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GISTs). This study retrospectively collected clinical and imaging data from 286 patients diagnosed with low-, intermediate-, or high-risk gastric GISTs, or primary lesions with LIM from three medical institutions. The patients were categorised into non-LIM and LIM groups according to whether they had synchronous or metachronous LIM. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to identify significant predictors of LIM. Additionally, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, subgroup, and pathologic-radiologic correlation analyses were conducted. A total of 124 patients were ultimately enroled. There were significant differences in sex, site, growth pattern, size, shape, ulceration and Ki-67 expression between LIM and non-LIM groups. ROC curve analysis demonstrated that IEU had the highest area under the curve for predicting LIM (AUC = 0.842; 95% CI: 0.760-0.924; p < 0.001). Multivariate analysis indicated that IEU was the most significant independent predictor of high LIM risk (OR = 88.62; 95% CI: 2.80-2803.54; p = 0.011). Subgroup analysis showed that IEU was more frequently associated with male sex, age ≤ 55 years, proximal sites, irregular shapes, mixed growth patterns, and a high Ki-67 expression. The CT feature of IEU serves as an independent predictor of LIM in gastric GISTs and is strongly associated with high Ki-67 expression. Question Accurate assessment of LIM risk in patients with gastric GISTs is crucial, yet current non-invasive predictors remain inadequate. Findings IEU on CT is an independent predictor of LIM, with high diagnostic accuracy and a significant association with elevated Ki-67 expression. Clinical relevance IEU on CT scans enables non-invasive risk stratification for LIM in gastric GISTs. Our study refined the assessment of ulceration types, highlighting significant heterogeneity, which may guide personalised treatment strategies.",2133

This study prospectively enrolled 74 patients with pathologically confirmed RC, who underwent APTw MRI before surgery from July 2022 to March 2023. Hematoxylin-eosin staining was used for TB scoring. K-means clustering (K = 4-6) was applied to obtain multiple sub-regions (n = 3-5), and corresponding histogram features (including mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, and 10th, 25th, 50th, 75th, and 90th quantile) of APT and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps were extracted and filtered using stepwise regression. When K = 5, the K-means clustering is four sub-regions, showing the best prediction for TB grade compared to K = 4 or 6. When K = 5, there were significantly higher histogram features of the APT map in sub-regions 3 and 4 in the high TB grade group compared to the low-intermediate TB grade group. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and internal validation suggested that the predictive efficiency of the model was highest when K = 5, with AUC, sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and kappa values of 0.92, 93%, 71%, 87%, and 0.65, respectively. There were no significant differences in the histogram features of each sub-region in the ADC map (p > 0.05). The sub-regional histogram features of APTw images can help to distinguish the heterogeneous regions of RC, which can be used to predict the TB grade of RC. Question Can the sub-regional histogram features of APTw MRI predict the tumor budding (TB) grade of rectal cancer (RC)? Findings Differences exist in histogram features of APT map subregions between high and low-intermediate TB grade groups; subregions of the APT map have different predictive abilities. Clinical relevance APT-weighted imaging might outperform DWI in predicting TB grade in RC.",1966

39499177,CT-guided Coaxial Lung Biopsy: Number of Cores and Association with Complications.,Radiology,2024,"Background Percutaneous CT-guided lung core-needle biopsy is a frequently performed and generally safe procedure. However, with advances in the management of lung cancer, there is a need for a greater amount of tissue for tumor genomic profiling and characterization. Purpose To determine whether the number of core samples obtained with percutaneous CT-guided lung biopsy is associated with postprocedural complications. Materials and Methods This retrospective study included consecutive patients who underwent percutaneous CT-guided coaxial lung core-needle biopsy for suspected primary lung cancer between November 2012 and August 2023 at an academic tertiary referral hospital. Patient data from medical records were collected, including demographics, lesion size and distance from pleura, and number of obtained biopsy samples. Postprocedural complications of pneumothorax, chest tube placement, perilesional hemorrhage, and hemoptysis were recorded. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to assess whether the number of cores was a predictive factor for lung biopsy complications. Results A total of 827 patients (mean age, 70.9 years ± 9.6 [SD]; 474 [57.3%] female patients) were included. The median lesion size was 22 mm (IQR, 15-34 mm), with 517 of 827 (62.5%) patients diagnosed with lung adenocarcinoma. Pneumothorax was noted in 171 of 827 (20.7%) patients, with a chest tube placed in 32 of 827 (3.9%), perilesional hemorrhage in 353 of 827 (42.7%), and hemoptysis in 20 of 827 (2.4%) patients.

However, knowledge is limited on imaging features of NMLs at screening US. Purpose To identify features of NMLs at screening US that are suspicious for malignancy based on mammographic findings. Materials and Methods This retrospective, multicenter study included asymptomatic women who underwent screening US between January 2012 and December 2019. Eligible women had NMLs at US, concurrent screening mammography, and record of a final diagnosis. Logistic regression analyses were used to identify factors associated with malignancy. The diagnostic performance of each sonographic feature according to mammographic findings was calculated. A reader study was performed to assess interreader agreement for sonographic features. Results Among 993 NMLs in 993 patients (mean age, 50 years ± 9 [SD]), 914 (92.0%) were benign and 79 (8.0%) were malignant. Mean size was larger for malignant NMLs than for benign NMLs (2.6 cm ± 1.1 vs 1.9 cm ± 0.8; ",1030

39480534,Performance of breast MRI for high-risk screening during lactation.,European radiology,2025,"To assess the diagnostic performance of breast MRI during lactation in the setting of high-risk breast cancer screening. Screening breast MRIs performed between April 2008 and March 2024 were retrospectively reviewed. Background parenchymal enhancement (BPE) grade was compared between lactating patients and patients who recently stopped lactating using the Mann-Whitney test. Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) scores prevalence rates were compared between lactating patients and controls encompassing young non-lactating patients using the Chi-square test. Diagnostic performance was calculated for patients with a biopsy reference or a 1-year radiologic follow-up. One-hundred forty-two screening breast MRIs were performed in lactating patients (n = 104, median age, 36.0 ± 6.0 years). Marked BPE appeared in 82% of cases (116/142), with a higher BPE grade in exams performed during lactation as compared with those performed in patients who had recently ceased lactating (p < 0.001). Screening MRIs performed during lactation had a higher rate of BI-RADS 3 scores (40/142, 28% vs. 683/8922, 7%, p < 0.001) and a lower rate of BI-RADS 1/2 scores (88/142, 62% vs. 7549/8922, 84.6%, p = 0.002) compared with those performed in controls (n = 8922). One pregnancy-associated breast cancer was detected, and one interval-cancer occurred. All MRI-guided biopsies were negative (n = 13). Screening breast MRI during lactation had 50% sensitivity (1/2), 60% specificity (72/120), 2.0% positive predictive value (1/49), and 98.6% negative predictive value (71/82). The efficacy of breast MRI for high-risk screening during lactation is limited by prominent BPE, leading to an increased rate of BI-RADS 3 categorization and diminished overall specificity. Question Studies on breast MRI during lactation were solely focused on studies conducted in patients with known cancer but not in the screening setting. Findings Screening breast MRI during lactation usually results in marked background parenchymal enhancement, negatively impacting its diagnostic performance. Clinical relevance Despite the lower performance, and amidst the significant risk of pregnancy-associated breast cancer, this screening approach remains relevant for lactating patients with high-risk profiles, such as BReast Cancer (BRCA) carriers. Radiologists should be familiar with the normal appearance of breast MRI during lactation.",2417

39475439,Supplemental breast cancer screening after negative mammography in US women with dense breasts.,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,2025,"The extent and determinants of supplemental screening among women with dense breasts are unclear. We evaluated a retrospective cohort of 498 855 women aged 40-74 years with heterogeneously or extremely dense breasts who obtained 1 176 251 negative screening mammography examinations during 2011-2019 in the United States. Overall, 2.8% and 0.3% of mammograms had supplemental ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) within 1 year, respectively. Onsite availability was associated with ultrasound (odds ratio [OR] = 4.35, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 4.21 to 4.49) but not MRI (OR = 0.94, 95% CI = 0.85 to 1.04). Facility academic affiliation and for-profit status were inversely associated with supplemental ultrasound (OR = 0.53, 95% CI = 0.49 to 0.57, and OR = 0.83, 95% CI = 0.81 to 0.86, respectively) and positively associated with supplemental MRI (OR = 3.04, 95% CI = 2.86 to 3.46, and OR = 1.88, 95% CI = 1.66 to 2.12, respectively). Supplemental screening was more likely to occur after passage of state-specific density notification laws than before passage (OR = 3.56, 95% CI = 3.30 to 3.84, and OR = 1.79, 95% CI = 1.60 to 2.00, respectively). These results show that supplemental breast imaging utilization has been uncommon and was related to facility factors and density legislation.",1307
39470795,Added value of body MRI to detect primary abdominal malignancies in the diagnostic work-up of patients with adenocarcinoma of unknown primary.,European radiology,2025,"This study aimed to evaluate the added benefit of body MRI (covering the chest, abdomen, and pelvis) to detect the primary tumour in patients with adenocarcinoma of unknown primary (ACUP) and a suspected abdominal malignancy in whom previous diagnostic work-up with CT and/or FDG-PET/CT did not yield a primary tumour diagnosis. Thirty ACUP patients with a suspected primary tumour in the abdomen/pelvis (based on pathology and/or pattern of disease) underwent MRI (T2-weighted, DWI, pre- and post-contrast T1-weighted) after completion of their initial diagnostic work-up with CT and/or PET/CT. Effects of MRI to establish a primary tumour diagnosis (and to detect additional metastatic sites) were documented. Integration of all available imaging data, additional diagnostic procedures (e.g., endoscopy), histopathology, and whole genome sequencing served as the composite standard of reference. MRI rendered a possible primary tumour diagnosis in 16/30 (53%) cases, which aligned with the final clinical diagnosis in 9/16 (56%) of these cases, thus resulting in a confirmed primary tumour diagnosis in 30% of our total patient cohort. These included four gastrointestinal, two hepatobiliary, one pancreatic, one ovarian and one breast cancer. MRI revealed extra metastatic sites in five patients (17%). MRI can be of added value in the diagnostic work-up of ACUP patients with a suspected primary tumour originating from the abdomen or pelvis, in particular to detect gastrointestinal or hepatobiliary malignancies. Larger studies are needed to confirm these results and identify specific ACUP patients that are most likely to benefit from MRI. Question Can body MRI help identify the primary tumour in patients with adenocarcinoma of unknown primary (ACUP)? Findings In this pilot of n = 30 ACUP patients with clinically suspected abdominal malignancies, body MRI was able to establish the primary tumour in 30% of cases. Clinical relevance Body MRI can be of added value (as an adjunct to CT and/or PET/CT) in the diagnostic work-up of ACUP patients with a suspected primary tumour originating from the abdomen or pelvis, especially to detect gastrointestinal or hepatobiliary malignancies.",2195
39470794,CT radiomics to predict pathologic complete response after neoadjuvant immunotherapy plus chemoradiotherapy in locally advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.,European radiology,2025,"To develop and validate a CT-based radiomics model to predict pathologic complete response (pCR) after neoadjuvant immunotherapy plus chemoradiotherapy (NICRT) in locally advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). A total of 105 patients with locally advanced ESCC receiving NICRT from February 2019 to December 2023 were enrolled. Patients were randomly divided into the training cohort and the test cohort at a 3:1 ratio. Enhanced CT scans were obtained before NICRT treatment. The 2D and 3D regions of interest were segmented, and features were extracted, followed by feature selection. Six algorithms were applied to construct the radiomics and clinical models. These models were evaluated by area under curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity, and their respective optimal algorithms were further compared. Forty-eight patients (45.75%) achieved pCR after NICRT. The AUC values of three algorithms in 2D radiomics models were higher than those in the 3D radiomics model and clinical model. Among these, the 2D radiomics model based on eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) exhibited the best performance, with an AUC of 0.89 (95% CI, 0.81-0.97), accuracy of 0.85, sensitivity of 0.86, and specificity of 0.84 in the training cohort, and an AUC of 0.80 (95% CI, 0.64-0.97), accuracy of 0.77, sensitivity of 0.84, and specificity of 0.69 in the test cohort. Calibration curves also showed good agreement between predicted and actual response, and the decision curve analysis further confirmed its clinical applicability. The 2D radiomics model can effectively predict pCR to NICRT in locally advanced ESCC. Question Can CT-based radiomics predict pathologic complete response (pCR) after neoadjuvant immunotherapy plus chemoradiotherapy (NICRT) in locally advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC)? Findings The model based on eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) performed best, with an AUC of 0.89 in the training and 0.80 in the test cohort. Clinical relevance This CT-based radiomics model exhibits promising performance for predicting pCR to NICRT in locally advanced ESCC, which may be valuable in personalized treatment plan optimization.",2175
39470686,Integrating Molecular Imaging and Transcriptomic Profiling in Advanced HER2-Positive Breast Cancer Receiving Trastuzumab Emtansine: An Analysis of the ZEPHIR Clinical Trial.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,2025,"The ZEPHIR clinical trial evaluated the role of [89Zr]trastuzumab-PET/CT (HER2-PET/CT) and 2-[18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose PET/CT ([18F]FDG-PET/CT) in predicting outcomes in patients with advanced HER2-positive breast cancer treated with trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1). In this study, we combined molecular/metabolic imaging and transcriptomic data to investigate the biological processes associated with [89Zr]trastuzumab and [18F]FDG uptake and to dissect the mechanisms involved in T-DM1 resistance. RNA was extracted from metastasis biopsies obtained in the ZEPHIR trial. HER2-PET/CT and [18F]FDG-PET/CT imaging data of biopsied lesions were integrated with transcriptomic data. Lesions were compared based on the level of [89Zr]trastuzumab uptake as well as on the presence/absence of metabolic response, defined comparing baseline and on-treatment [18F]FDG-PET/CT. We analyzed matched transcriptomic and molecular/metabolic imaging data for 24 metastases. Genes and pathways involved in extracellular matrix (ECM) organization and glycosylphosphatidylinositol synthesis were enriched in lesions presenting low [89Zr]trastuzumab uptake. [18F]FDG uptake at baseline correlated with proliferation and immune-related processes. Hypoxia and ECM-related processes were enriched in lesions showing no metabolic response to T-DM1, whereas immune-related processes were associated with high [89Zr]trastuzumab uptake and metabolic response. Gene signatures including differentially expressed genes according to [89Zr]trastuzumab uptake and metabolic response showed predictive value in an external cohort. To the best of our knowledge, this study represents the first correlative analysis between [89Zr]trastuzumab tumor uptake and gene expression profiling in humans. Our findings suggest a role for ECM in impairing [89Zr]trastuzumab tumor uptake and T-DM1 metabolic response in advanced HER2-positive breast cancer, highlighting the potential of molecular imaging to depict tumor microenvironment features.",2004
39470424,Predicting Recurrence after Sublobar Resection in Patients with Lung Adenocarcinoma Using Preoperative Chest CT Scans.,Radiology,2024,"Background Sublobar resection for lung cancer is usually guided by cutoff values for consolidation size (maximal diameter of the solid tumor component) and consolidation-to-tumor ratio (CTR). The effects of these factors as continuous variables and the reason for established cutoffs are, to the knowledge of the authors, unexplored. Purpose To quantitatively assess the predictive value of CTR and consolidation size for cancer recurrence risk after sublobar resection in clinical stage IA lung adenocarcinoma. Materials and Methods This retrospective study reviewed sublobar resection for clinical stage IA lung adenocarcinoma performed between January 2010 and December 2019. A restricted cubic spline function verified linearity by estimating recurrence probabilities using CTR and consolidation size obtained on preoperative CT scans. Statistical analyses included a Cox proportional hazards model to identify risk factors for cancer recurrence and the Cochran-Armitage trend test for the association between CTR and consolidation size.

39470165,CTR-FAPI PET Enables Precision Management of Medullary Thyroid Carcinoma.,Cancer discovery,2025,"Medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) can only be cured through the excision of all metastatic lesions, but current clinical practice fails to localize the disease in 29% to 60% of patients. Previously, we developed a fibroblast activation protein inhibitor (FAPI)-based covalent targeted radioligand (CTR) for improved detection sensitivity and accuracy. In this first-in-class clinical trial, we head-to-head compared [68Ga]Ga-CTR-FAPI PET-CT and [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose ([18F]FDG) PET-CT in 50 patients with MTC. The primary endpoint was the patient-based detection rate, with [68Ga]Ga-CTR-FAPI exhibiting higher detection than [18F]FDG (98% vs. 66%, P = 0.0002). This improved detection was attributed to increased tumor uptake (maximum standardized uptake value = 11.71 ± 9.16 vs. 2.55 ± 1.73, P < 0.0001). Diagnostic accuracy, validated on lesions with gold-standard pathology, was greater for [68Ga]Ga-CTR-FAPI compared with [18F]FDG (96.7% vs. 43.3%, P < 0.0001). Notably, the management of 32% of patients was altered following [68Ga]Ga-CTR-FAPI PET-CT, and the surgical plan was changed for 66.7% of patients. Overall, [68Ga]Ga-CTR-FAPI PET-CT provided superior detection and diagnostic accuracy compared with [18F]FDG PET-CT, enabling precision management of patients with MTC. Significance: In this first-in-class clinical trial of CTR, [68Ga]Ga-CTR-FAPI demonstrated an improved patient-based detection rate (98%), tumor uptake (maximum standardized uptake value = 11.71 ± 9.16), and pathology-validated diagnostic accuracy (96.7%) compared with the currently approved method in MTC treatment.

39455455,Impact of non-contrast-enhanced imaging input sequences on the generation of virtual contrast-enhanced breast MRI scans using neural network.,European radiology,2025,"To investigate how different combinations of T1-weighted (T1w), T2-weighted (T2w), and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) impact the performance of virtual contrast-enhanced (vCE) breast MRI. The IRB-approved, retrospective study included 1064 multiparametric breast MRI scans (age: 52 ± 12 years) obtained from 2017 to 2020 (single site, two 3-T MRI). Eleven independent neural networks were trained to derive vCE images from varying input combinations of T1w, T2w, and multi-b-value DWI sequences (b-value = 50-1500 s/mm The independent test set consisted of 187 cases. The quantitative metrics significantly improved in target findings when multi-b-value DWI sequences were included during vCE training (p < 0.05). Non-significant effects (p > 0.05) were observed for the quantitative metrics on the full breast volume when comparing input combinations including T1w. Using T1w and DWI acquisitions during vCE training is necessary to achieve high satisfaction with contrast/SNR and good conspicuity of the enhancing findings. The input combination of T1w, T2w, and DWI sequences with three b-values showed the best qualitative performance. vCE breast MRI performance is significantly influenced by input sequences. Quantitative metrics and visual quality of vCE images significantly benefit when multi b-value DWI is added to morphologic T1w-/T2w sequences as input for model training. Question How do different MRI sequences impact the performance of virtual contrast-enhanced (vCE) breast MRI? Findings The input combination of T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and diffusion-weighted imaging sequences with three b-values showed the best qualitative performance. Clinical relevance While in the future neural networks providing virtual contrast-enhanced images might further improve accessibility to breast MRI, the significant influence of input data needs to be considered during translational research.",1902
39448418,The preoperative prediction of lymph node metastasis of resectable pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma using dual-layer spectral computed tomography.,European radiology,2025,"To investigate the value of dual-layer spectral computed tomography (DLCT) parameters derived from primary tumors in predicting lymph node metastasis (LNM) of resectable pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). In this retrospective study, patients with resectable PDAC who underwent DLCT within 2-week intervals before surgery were enrolled and randomly divided into training and validation sets at a 7:3 ratio. The patients' clinical data, CT morphological features, and DLCT parameters were analyzed. Univariate and multivariate logistic analyses were used to identify the predictors and construct a predictive model, and receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves were programmed to evaluate the predictive efficacy. We enrolled 107 patients (44 patients with LNM and 63 patients without LNM). Among all variables, iodine concentration in the venous phase, extracellular volume, and tumor size were identified as independent predictors of LNM. The nomogram model, incorporating the two DLCT parameters and the morphological feature, achieved an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.877 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.803-0.952) and 0.842 (95% CI: 0.707-0.977) for predicting LNM in the training and validation sets, respectively. Furthermore, the AUC of the nomogram model was greater than that of morphological features of lymph nodes in the training (AUC = 0.877 vs. 0.570) and validation (AUC = 0.842 vs. 0.583) sets. DLCT has the potential to predict LNM in patients with resectable PDAC and show a better predictive value than morphological features of lymph nodes. Question Morphological features of lymph nodes are of limited value in detecting metastatic lymph nodes in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Findings Dual-layer spectral computed tomography (DLCT) parameters and morphological features derived from PDAC lesions show good preoperatively predictive efficacy for lymph node metastasis.

39437011,Metabolic Tumor Volume Assessed by 18F FDG-PET CT Scan as a Predictive Biomarker for Immune Checkpoint Blockers in Advanced NSCLC and Its Biological Correlates.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,2025,"This study aimed to explore metabolic tumor volume (MTV) as assessed by 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography-computed tomography (18F-FDG-PET/CT) and understand its biological meaning in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) exposed to immune checkpoint blockers (ICB). In this study, patients with advanced NSCLC and a positive PET scan within 42 days of first-line treatment were enrolled in 11 institutions across four countries. Total MTV (tMTV) was analyzed, with a 42% maximum standardized uptake value threshold. Survival was analyzed according to high tMTV (≥median). Plasma proteomic profile, whole exome, transcriptome, and other analyses were performed on monocentric cohorts to explore its biological correlates. Of the 518 patients included, 167 received ICBs, 257 had chemotherapy plus ICBs, and 94 had chemotherapy. Median tMTV was 99 cm3. Median overall survival (OS) for patients with high tMTV treated with ICBs was 11.4 vs. 29.6 months (P < 0.0012) for those with low tMTV. In patients who received chemotherapy-ICB, tMTV did not correlate with OS (P = 0.099). In patients with programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) ≥1% and high tMTV, chemotherapy-ICB combination was associated with longer OS compared with ICBs alone (20 vs. 11.4 months; P = 0.026), while no survival differences were observed in the low tMTV group. High tMTV correlated (and its detrimental effect seems to be driven) with a specific proteomic profile and increase in genomic instability. Our analysis indicates high tMTV is linked to an increase in systemic inflammation, specific cytokines production, and chromosomal instability. tMTV may serve as one of the biomarkers to select the best upfront strategy in patients with PD-L1-positive advanced NSCLC.",1767

39436294,Lung Nodule Management in Low-Dose CT Screening for Lung Cancer: Lessons from the NELSON Trial.,Radiology,2024,"Screening with low-dose CT (LDCT) in a high-risk population, as defined by age and smoking behavior, reduces lung cancer-related mortality. However, LDCT screening presents a major challenge. Numerous, mostly benign, nodules are seen in the lungs during screening. The question is how to distinguish the malignant from the benign nodules. Various studies use different protocols for nodule management. The Dutch-Belgian NELSON (Nederlands-Leuvens Longkanker Screenings Onderzoek) trial, the largest European lung cancer screening trial, used distinctions based on nodule volumetric assessment and growth rate. This review discusses key findings from the NELSON study regarding the characteristics of screening-detected nodules, including nodule size and its volumetric assessment, growth rate, subtype, and their associated malignancy risk. These results are compared with findings from other screening studies and current recommendations for lung nodule management. By examining differences in nodule management strategies and providing a comprehensive overview of outcomes specific to lung cancer screening, this review aims to contribute to the broader discussion on optimizing lung nodule management in screening programs.",1226

Purpose To investigate the clinical value of time-dependent diffusion MRI-based microstructural mapping for noninvasive prediction of molecular subtypes and pathologic complete response (pCR) in participants with breast cancer. Materials and Methods Participants with invasive breast cancer who underwent pretreatment with time-dependent diffusion MRI between February 2021 and May 2023 were prospectively enrolled. Four microstructural parameters were estimated using the IMPULSED method (a form of time-dependent diffusion MRI), along with three apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) measurements and a relative ADC diffusion-weighted imaging parameter. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to identify parameters associated with each molecular subtype and pCR. A predictive model based on associated parameters was constructed, and its performance was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and compared by using the DeLong test. The time-dependent diffusion MRI parameters were validated based on correlation with pathologic measurements. Results The analysis included 408 participants with breast cancer (mean age, 51.9 years ± 9.1 [SD]). Of these, 221 participants were administered neoadjuvant chemotherapy and 54 (24.4%) achieved pCR.

39436291,Impact on Prognosis of Stage I Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Secondary to Delays in Diagnostic Workup.,Radiology,2024,"Background Diagnostic workup of small pulmonary nodules often requires follow-up CT scans to confirm nodule growth before invasive diagnostics or treatment. Purpose To confirm prior results from the International Early Lung Cancer Action Program (I-ELCAP) on quantifying decreases in lung cancer prognosis by using two large databases, the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) and International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC). Materials and Methods In this retrospective study, a model was developed to predict cure rates based on size of solid nodules using the NLST (August 2002 to summer 2007) and IASLC (January 2011 to December 2019) databases, focusing on stage I non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Kaplan-Meier methods were used to calculate 10-year lung cancer-specific survival and 5-year overall survival rates for different tumor sizes. Tumor diameter increases after 90-, 180-, and 365-day delays were estimated using volume doubling times (VDTs) of 60, 120, and 240 days corresponding to fast, moderate, and slow tumor growth. Initial and delayed lung cancer cure rates were assessed across nine scenarios of time delays and tumor growth rates and compared with the previous results of the I-ELCAP database. Results Using regression models based on 166 NLST and 22 590 IASLC patients with NSCLC, 10-year lung cancer-specific survival and 5-year overall survival, respectively, for tumors 4.0-20.0 mm in diameter were estimated. For a 20.0-mm tumor with a 60-day VDT in the NLST database, the lung cancer-specific survival decreased from 83.4% to 76.5%, 66.8%, and 32.3% after 90, 180, and 365 days, respectively. The IASLC database showed similar decreases in 5-year overall survival, from 81.2% to 73.4%, 62.4%, and 23.3% after 90, 180, and 365 days, respectively. Comparison across NLST, IASLC, and I-ELCAP databases revealed minor variations in lung cancer cure rates between 79.9% and 83.4%, with reductions of 6.9%-8.3% after a 180-day delay with a 120-day VDT. Conclusion The NLST and IASLC databases confirmed prior estimates from the I-ELCAP database for the decrease in lung cancer prognosis due to diagnostic delays. © RSNA, 2024 ",2172
39426390,"Access to diagnostic imaging and radiotherapy technologies for patients with cancer in the Baltic countries, eastern Europe, central Asia, and the Caucasus: a comprehensive analysis.",The Lancet. Oncology,2024,"Only 10-40% of patients with cancer in low-income and middle-income countries were able to access curative or palliative radiotherapy in 2015. We aimed to assess the current status of diagnostic imaging and radiotherapy services in the Baltic countries, eastern Europe, central Asia, and the Caucasus by collecting and analysing local data. This Access to Radiotherapy (ART) comprehensive analysis used data from 12 countries: the three Baltic countries (Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania), two countries in eastern Europe (Moldova and Ukraine), four countries in central Asia (Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan), and three countries in the Caucasus (Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia), referred to here as the ART countries. We were not able to obtain engagement from Turkmenistan. The primary outcome was to update the extent of shortfalls in the availability of diagnostic imaging and radiotherapy technologies and radiotherapy human resources for patients with cancer in former Soviet Union countries. Following the methods of previous similar studies, we developed three questionnaires-targeted towards radiation oncologists, regulatory authorities, and researchers-requesting detailed information on the availability of these resources. Authors from participating countries sent two copies of the appropriate questionnaire to each of 107 identified institutions and coordinated data collection at the national level. Questionnaires were distributed in English and Russian and responses in both languages were accepted. Two virtual meetings held on May 30 and June 1, 2022, were followed by an in-person workshop held in Almaty, Kazakhstan, in September, 2022, attended by representatives from all participating countries, to discuss and further validate the data submitted up to this point. The data were collected on a dedicated web page, developed by the International Cancer Expert Corps, and were then extracted and analysed. Data were collected between May 10 and Nov 30, 2022. 81 (76%) of the 107 institutions contacted, representing all 12 ART countries, submitted 167 completed questionnaires. The Baltic countries, which are defined as high-income countries, had more diagnostic imaging equipment and radiotherapy human resources (eg, Latvia [1·74] and Lithuania [1·47] have a much higher number of radiation oncologists per 100 000 population than the other ART countries, all of which had <1 radiation oncologist per 100 000 population) and greater radiotherapy technological capacities (higher numbers of linear accelerators and, similar to Georgia, high total external beam radiotherapy capacity) than the other ART countries, as well as high cancer detection rates (Latvia 311 cases per 100 000 population, Lithuania 292, and Estonia 288 vs, for example, 178 in Armenia, 144 in Ukraine, and 72 in Kazakhstan) and low cancer mortality-to-cancer incidence ratios (Estonia 0·43, Latvia 0·49, and Lithuania 0·48; lower than all but Kazakhstan [0·41]). The highest cancer mortality-to-cancer incidence ratios were reported by Moldova (0·71) and Georgia (0·74). Our findings show that the number of cancer cases, availability of diagnostic imaging equipment, radiation oncologists and radiotherapy capacity, and cancer mortality-to-cancer incidence ratios all vary substantially across the countries studied, with the three high-income, well resourced Baltic countries performing better in all metrics than the included countries in eastern Europe, central Asia, and the Caucasus. These data highlight the challenges faced by many countries in this study, and might help to justify increased investment of financial, human, and technological resources, with the aim to improve cancer treatment outcomes.

39425768,Preoperative prediction of diffuse glioma type and grade in adults: a gadolinium-free MRI-based decision tree.,European radiology,2025,"To develop a gadolinium-free MRI-based diagnosis prediction decision tree (DPDT) for adult-type diffuse gliomas and to assess the added value of gadolinium-based contrast agent (GBCA) enhanced images. This study included preoperative grade 2-4 adult-type diffuse gliomas (World Health Organization 2021) scanned between 2010 and 2021. The DPDT, incorporating eleven GBCA-free MRI features, was developed using 18% of the dataset based on consensus readings. Diagnosis predictions involved grade (grade 2 vs. grade 3/4) and molecular status (isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) and 1p/19q). GBCA-free diagnosis was predicted using DPDT, while GBCA-enhanced diagnosis included post-contrast images. The accuracy of these predictions was assessed by three raters with varying experience levels in neuroradiology using the test dataset. Agreement analyses were applied to evaluate the prediction performance/reproducibility. The test dataset included 303 patients (age (SD): 56.7 (14.2) years, female/male: 114/189, low-grade/high-grade: 54/249, IDH-mutant/wildtype: 82/221, 1p/19q-codeleted/intact: 34/269). Per-rater GBCA-free predictions achieved ≥ 0.85 (95%-CI: 0.80-0.88) accuracy for grade and ≥ 0.75 (95%-CI: 0.70-0.80) for molecular status, while GBCA-enhanced predictions reached ≥ 0.87 (95%-CI: 0.82-0.90) and ≥ 0.77 (95%-CI: 0.71-0.81), respectively. No accuracy difference was observed between GBCA-free and GBCA-enhanced predictions. Group inter-rater agreement was moderate for GBCA-free (0.56 (95%-CI: 0.46-0.66)) and substantial for GBCA-enhanced grade prediction (0.68 (95%-CI: 0.58-0.78), p = 0.008), while substantial for both GBCA-free (0.75 (95%-CI: 0.69-0.80) and GBCA-enhanced (0.77 (95%-CI: 0.71-0.82), p = 0.51) molecular status predictions. The proposed GBCA-free diagnosis prediction decision tree performed well, with GBCA-enhanced images adding little to the preoperative diagnostic accuracy of adult-type diffuse gliomas. Question Given health and environmental concerns, is there a gadolinium-free imaging protocol to preoperatively evaluate gliomas comparable to the gadolinium-enhanced standard practice? Findings The proposed gadolinium-free diagnosis prediction decision tree for adult-type diffuse gliomas performed well, and gadolinium-enhanced MRI demonstrated only limited improvement in diagnostic accuracy. Clinical relevance Even inexperienced raters effectively classified adult-type diffuse gliomas using the gadolinium-free diagnosis prediction decision tree, which, until further validation, can be used alongside gadolinium-enhanced images to respect standard practice, despite this study showing that gadolinium-enhanced images hardly improved diagnostic accuracy.",2703
39414655,Dual-energy computed tomography for predicting histological grading and survival in patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.,European radiology,2025,"We evaluated the value of dual-energy computed tomography (DECT) parameters derived from pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) to discriminate between high- and low-grade tumors and predict overall survival (OS) in patients. Data were retrospectively collected from 169 consecutive patients with pathologically confirmed PDAC who underwent third-generation dual-source DECT enhanced dual-phase scanning before surgery between January 2017 and March 2023. Patients with prior treatments, other malignancies, small tumors, or poor-quality scans were excluded. Two radiologists evaluated three clinical and seven radiological features and measured sixteen DECT-derived parameters. Univariate and multivariate analyses were applied to select independent predictors. A prediction model and a corresponding nomogram were developed, and the area under the curve (AUC), calibration, and clinical applicability were assessed. The correlations between factors and OS were evaluated using Kaplan-Meier survival and Cox regression analyses. One hundred sixty-nine patients were randomly divided into training (n = 118) and validation (n = 51) cohorts, among which 43 (36.4%) and 19 (37.3%) had high-grade PDAC confirmed by pathology, respectively. The vascular invasion, normalized iodine concentration in the venous phase, and effective atomic number in the venous phase were independent predictors for histological grading. A nomogram was constructed to predict the risk of high-grade tumors in PDAC, with AUCs of 0.887 and 0.844 in the training and validation cohorts, respectively. The nomogram exhibited good calibration and was more beneficial than a single parameter in both cohorts. Pathological- and nomoscore-predicted high-grade PDACs were associated with poor OS (all p < 0.05). The nomogram, which combines DECT parameters and radiological features, can predict the histological grade and OS in patients with PDAC before surgery. Question Preoperative determination of histological grade in PDAC is crucial for guiding treatment, yet current methods are invasive and limited. Findings A DECT-based nomogram combining vascular invasion, normalized iodine concentration, and effective atomic number accurately predicts histological grade and OS in PDAC patients. Clinical relevance The DECT-based nomogram is a reliable, non-invasive tool for predicting histological grade and OS in PDAC. It provides essential information to guide personalized treatment strategies, potentially improving patient management and outcomes.",2522
39414654,Follow-up analysis of lesion characteristics of enchondromas and atypical cartilaginous tumours of the knee and shoulder region on MRI.,European radiology,2025,"Enchondromas (ECs) and atypical cartilaginous tumours (ACTs), respectively, represent benign and intermediate cartilaginous bone tumours. Differentiation between these tumour entities bears difficulties, as histology and MRI cannot always provide exact diagnoses. Observation of the natural course of ECs/ACTs via follow-up MRIs might support tumour distinction without needing biopsy harbouring sampling error. Reports of patients that had undergone MRI exams of the knee (n = 44.762) or shoulder (n = 21.550) at a single radiology institute between 01.01.2007 and 01.03.2020 were searched for ECs/ACTs with at least one follow-up MRI. Scans of 176 patients (with 182 cartilage lesions) fulfilling these criteria were subsequently re-examined together with corresponding MRI reports to evaluate morphological tumour development over time, focusing on potential alterations of lesion size, tumour-related oedema, and scalloping. Median follow-up time was 27 ± 53 months for knee tumours and 26 ± 32 months for shoulder lesions. Presence of tumour growth was significantly higher in ACTs than in ECs both at the knee (p = 0.04) and shoulder (p = 0.03). While ACTs were associated with median tumour growth rates of 0.039 mm/month (knee) and 0.083 mm/month (shoulder), ECs of the knee and shoulder showed lower median growth rates equivalent to 0.0 mm/month (p < 0.01, p < 0.01). ECs and ACTs both presented stable regarding tumour-related oedema and scalloping during follow-up. ACTs and ECs show different tumour growth rates. Growth rates are slow for both, ECs and ACTs, supporting the current concept of watchful waiting. ECs may decrease in size. Follow-up MRIs may support the radiological differentiation of cartilage lesions. Question Both singular MRI and histological examination have limitations regarding differentiation of enchondromas (EC) and atypical cartilaginous tumours (ACTs). Findings Median ACT growth rates were 0.039 mm/month (knee) and 0.083 mm/month (shoulder), while median growth rates of EC in the knee and shoulder were 0.0 mm/month. Clinical relevance Active surveillance is a safe strategy when dealing with ECs and ACTs of the long bones; follow-up MRIs may support tumour distinction of cartilage lesions, as ECs and ACTs show different growth behaviour.",2287

In total, 1090 patients from Beijing Tiantan Hospital, Capital Medical University, and 131 from Lanzhou University Second Hospital were categorized as primary cohort (PC) and external validation cohort (EVC), respectively. An MRI-based DLRN was developed in PC to distinguish ISFTs from AMs. We validated the DLRN and compared it with a clinical model (CM) in EVC. In total, 149 ISFT patients were followed up. We carried out Cox regression analysis on DLRN score, clinical characteristics, and histological stratification. Besides, we evaluated the association between independent risk factors and OS in the follow-up patients using Kaplan-Meier curves. The DLRN outperformed CM in distinguishing ISFTs from AMs (area under the curve [95% confidence interval (CI)]: 0.86 [0.84-0.88] for DLRN and 0.70 [0.67-0.72] for CM, p < 0.001) in EVC. Patients with high DLRN score [per 1 increase; hazard ratio (HR) 1.079, 95% CI: 1.009-1.147, p = 0.019] and subtotal resection (STR) [per 1 increase; HR 2.573, 95% CI: 1.337-4.932, p = 0.004] were associated with a shorter OS. A statistically significant difference in OS existed between the high and low DLRN score groups with a cutoff value of 12.19 (p < 0.001). There is also a difference in OS between total excision (GTR) and STR groups (p < 0.001). The proposed DLRN outperforms the CM in distinguishing ISFTs from AMs and can predict OS for ISFT patients. The proposed MRI-based deep learning radiomic nomogram outperforms the clinical model in distinguishing ISFTs from AMs and can predict OS of ISFT patients, which could guide the surgical strategy and predict prognosis for patients.

A proposal from the EUSOBI International Breast Diffusion-weighted Imaging working group.,European radiology,2025,"This study by the EUSOBI International Breast Diffusion-weighted Imaging (DWI) working group aimed to evaluate the current and future applications of advanced DWI in breast imaging. A literature search and a comprehensive survey of EUSOBI members to explore the clinical use and potential of advanced DWI techniques and a literature search were involved. Advanced DWI approaches such as intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM), diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI), and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) were assessed for their current status and challenges in clinical implementation. Although a literature search revealed an increasing number of publications and growing academic interest in advanced DWI, the survey revealed limited adoption of advanced DWI techniques among EUSOBI members, with 32% using IVIM models, 17% using non-Gaussian diffusion techniques for kurtosis analysis, and only 8% using DTI. A variety of DWI techniques are used, with IVIM being the most popular, but less than half use it, suggesting that the study identified a gap between the potential benefits of advanced DWI and its actual use in clinical practice. The findings highlight the need for further research, standardization and simplification to transition advanced DWI from a research tool to regular practice in breast imaging. The study concludes with guidelines and recommendations for future research directions and clinical implementation, emphasizing the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration in this field to improve breast cancer diagnosis and treatment. Advanced DWI in breast imaging, while currently in limited clinical use, offers promising improvements in diagnosis, staging, and treatment monitoring, highlighting the need for standardized protocols, accessible software, and collaborative approaches to promote its broader integration into routine clinical practice. Increasing number of publications on advanced DWI over the last decade indicates growing research interest. EUSOBI survey shows that advanced DWI is used primarily in research, not extensively in clinical practice. More research and standardization are needed to integrate advanced DWI into routine breast imaging practice.",2191

Purpose To assess the diagnostic accuracy, repeatability, and reproducibility of pseudo-CT MRI sequences (zero echo time [ZTE], gradient-echo black bone [BB]) in detecting osteolytic lesions in MM using whole-body CT as the reference standard. Materials and Methods In this prospective study, consecutive patients were enrolled in our academic hospital between June 2021 and December 2022. Inclusion criteria were newly diagnosed MM, monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance at high risk for MM, or suspicion of progressive MM. Participants underwent ZTE and BB sequences covering the lumbar spine, pelvis, and proximal femurs as part of 3-T whole-body MRI examinations, as well as clinically indicated fluorine 18 fluorodeoxyglucose PET/CT examination within 1 month that included optimized whole-body CT. Ten bone regions and two scores (categorical score = presence/absence of osteolytic lesion; semiquantitative score = osteolytic lesion count) were assessed by three radiologists (two experienced and one unfamiliar with pseudo-CT reading) on the ZTE, BB, and whole-body CT images. The accuracy, repeatability, and reproducibility of categorical scores (according to Gwet agreement coefficients AC1 and AC2) and differences in semiquantitative scores were assessed at the per-sequence, per-region, and per-patient levels.

Purpose To investigate whether screening performance improves when screening mammography examinations are ordered for batch reading according to mammographic characteristics that may promote visual adaptation. Materials and Methods This retrospective multireader multicase study was performed with mammograms obtained between September 2016 and May 2019. The screening examinations, each consisting of four mammograms, were interpreted by 13 radiologists in three distinct orders: randomly, by increasing volumetric breast density (VBD), and based on a self-supervised learning (SSL) encoding (examinations automatically grouped as ""looking similar""). An eye tracker recorded radiologists' eye movements during interpretation. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity of random-ordered readings were compared with those of VBD- and SSL-ordered readings using mixed-model analysis of variance. Reading time, fixation metrics, and perceived density were compared using Wilcoxon signed-rank tests. Results Mammography examinations (75 with breast cancer, 75 without breast cancer) from 150 women (median age, 55 years [IQR, 50-63]) were read. The examinations ordered by increasing VBD versus randomly had an increased AUC (0.93 [95% CI: 0.91, 0.96] vs 0.92 [95% CI: 0.89, 0.95]; ",1584

However, there are no large multicenter studies assessing the potential impact of using O-RADS US version 2022 risk score in patients referred for surgery for an ovarian or adnexal lesion. Purpose To retrospectively determine the proportion of patients with ovarian or adnexal lesions without acute symptoms who may have been managed conservatively by using the O-RADS US version 2022 risk score. Materials and Methods This multicenter retrospective study included patients with ovarian cystic lesions and nonacute symptoms who underwent surgical resection after US before the introduction of O-RADS US between January 2011 and December 2014. Investigators blinded to the final diagnoses recorded lesion imaging features and O-RADS US risk scores. The frequency of malignancy and the diagnostic performance of the risk score were calculated.

39368224,Inadequate staging and excessive surveillance imaging: Evaluating the magnitude of benefit of targeted therapies in lung cancer.,"European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",2024,"Several phase III trials have altered the management of oncogenic driven non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) including those harboring EGFR and ALK mutations. However, several of these pivotal trials deviated from standard-of-care practices for either baseline imaging or surveillance imaging. This occurred despite sponsor acknowledgement in a clinical trial protocol that historical trials utilized imaging modalities that potentially under-staged patients. Inadequate baseline imaging for adjuvant trials instead of PET/CT may not identify individuals with metastatic disease, and thereby subject such individuals with metastatic disease to inferior treatment if randomized to the control arm. Similarly, more frequent surveillance imaging than what is considered standard-of-care may identify disease progression earlier than what is expected in real-world clinical practice and therefore embellish the magnitude of benefit between a targeted therapy and the control arm. While targeted therapies have provided clinical benefit for individuals with oncogenic driven NSCLC, physicians and patients must be cognizant that clinical trial deviations from standard-of-care imaging practices may have embellished the magnitude of benefit for several of these therapies.",1266

This review aims to provide an overview of primary lung cancer growth rate, quantified by volume doubling time (VDT) through computed tomography (CT) measurement. Using PRISMA-DTA guideline, PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science were searched until March 2024 for studies reporting CT-measured VDT of pathologically confirmed primary lung cancer before intervention. Summary data were extracted from published reports by two independent researchers. Primary outcomes were pooled mean VDT of lung cancer by nodule type and histology, distribution of indolent lung cancer (defined as VDT>400 days or negative), and correlated factors. Thirty-three studies were eligible, comprising 3959 patients with primary lung cancer (mean age range:57.6-77.0 years; 60.0 % men). The pooled mean VDT for solid, part-solid, and nonsolid lung cancer were 207, 536, and 669 days, respectively (p < 0.001). When stratified by histology within solid lung cancer, the pooled mean VDT of adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, small cell lung cancer, and others were 223, 140, 73, and 178 days, respectively (p < 0.001). Indolent lung cancer was observed in 34.9 % of lung cancer, predominantly in adenocarcinoma (68.9 %). Adenocarcinoma was associated with slower growth, whereas factors such as tumor size, solidity, TNM staging, and smoking history were positively associated with growth rates. Pooled mean VDT of solid lung cancer was approximately 207 days, demonstrating significant variability in histology yet remaining under the 400-day referral threshold. Key predictors of growth rate include histology, size, solidity, and smoking history, essential for tailoring early intervention strategies. CRD42023408069.",1780

Specifically, we examined whether DBT reduces interval cancer rates (ICRs) in population breast cancer screening. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of DBT screening studies (identified from January 2013 to March 2024). We included both RCTs and non-randomised prospective studies that used an independent comparison for our primary outcome ICRs. The risk of bias was assessed with QUADAS-2. We compared the ICR, cancer detection rate (CDR), and recall rate of DBT and DM screening using random effects meta-analysis models. Subgroup analyses estimated outcomes by study design. Sensitivity analyses estimated absolute effects from relative effects. Ten prospective studies (three RCTs, seven non-randomised) were eligible; all had a low risk of bias. There were 205,245 DBT-screened and 306,476 DM-screened participants with follow-up for interval cancer data. The pooled absolute ICR did not significantly differ between DBT and DM: -2.92 per 10,000 screens (95% CI: -6.39 to 0.54); however subsequent subgroup analysis indicated certain study designs may have biased this ICR estimate. Pooled ICR from studies that only sampled groups from the same time and region indicated DBT led to 5.50 less IC per 10,000 screens (95% CI: -9.47 to -1.54). Estimates from subgroup analysis that compared randomised and non-randomised trials did not significantly differ. This meta-analysis provides suggestive evidence that DBT decreases ICR relative to DM screening; further evidence is needed to reduce uncertainty regarding ICR differences between DBT and DM. Question Does DBT have long-term benefits over standard DM? Finding We find suggestive evidence in our primary analysis and stronger evidence in a follow-up analysis that DBT reduces interval cancers. Clinical relevance This meta-analysis provides the first indication that DBT may detect additional cancers that are clinically meaningful, based on suggestive evidence of a reduction in ICR. This finding does not preclude the simultaneous possibility of overdiagnosis.",2209

Oncology,2024,"Multiple risk-prediction models are used in clinical practice to triage patients as being at low risk or high risk of ovarian cancer. In the ROCkeTS study, we aimed to identify the best diagnostic test for ovarian cancer in symptomatic patients, through head-to-head comparisons of risk-prediction models, in a real-world setting. Here, we report the results for the postmenopausal cohort. In this multicentre, prospective diagnostic accuracy study, we recruited newly presenting female patients aged 16-90 years with non-specific symptoms and raised CA125 or abnormal ultrasound results (or both) who had been referred via rapid access, elective clinics, or emergency presentations from 23 hospitals in the UK. Patients with normal CA125 and simple ovarian cysts of smaller than 5 cm in diameter, active non-ovarian malignancy, or previous ovarian malignancy, or those who were pregnant or declined a transvaginal scan, were ineligible. In this analysis, only postmenopausal participants were included. Participants completed a symptom questionnaire, gave a blood sample, and had transabdominal and transvaginal ultrasounds performed by International Ovarian Tumour Analysis consortium (IOTA)-certified sonographers. Index tests were Risk of Malignancy 1 (RMI1) at a threshold of 200, Risk of Malignancy Algorithm (ROMA) at multiple thresholds, IOTA Assessment of Different Neoplasias in the Adnexa (ADNEX) at thresholds of 3% and 10%, IOTA SRRisk model at thresholds of 3% and 10%, IOTA Simple Rules (malignant vs benign, or inconclusive), and CA125 at 35 IU/mL. In a post-hoc analysis, the Ovarian Adnexal and Reporting Data System (ORADS) at 10% was derived from IOTA ultrasound variables using established methods since ORADS was described after completion of recruitment. Index tests were conducted by study staff masked to the results of the reference standard. The comparator was RMI1 at the 250 threshold (the current UK National Health Service standard of care). The reference standard was surgical or biopsy tissue histology or cytology within 3 months, or a self-reported diagnosis of ovarian cancer at 12 month follow-up. The primary outcome was diagnostic accuracy at predicting primary invasive ovarian cancer versus benign or normal histology, assessed by analysing the sensitivity, specificity, C-index, area under receiver operating characteristic curve, positive and negative predictive values, and calibration plots in participants with conclusive reference standard results and available index test data. This study is registered with the International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number registry (ISRCTN17160843). Between July 13, 2015, and Nov 30, 2018, 1242 postmenopausal patients were recruited, of whom 215 (17%) had primary ovarian cancer. 166 participants had missing, inconclusive, or other reference standard results; therefore, data from a maximum of 1076 participants were used to assess the index tests for the primary outcome. Compared with RMI1 at 250 (sensitivity 82·9% [95% CI 76·7 to 88·0], specificity 87·4% [84·9 to 89·6]), IOTA ADNEX at 10% was more sensitive (difference of -13·9% [-20·2 to -7·6], p<0·0001) but less specific (difference of 28·5% [24·7 to 32·3], p<0·0001). ROMA at 29·9 had similar sensitivity (difference of -3·6% [-9·1 to 1·9], p=0·24) but lower specificity (difference of 5·2% [2·5 to 8·0], p=0·0001). RMI1 at 200 had similar sensitivity (difference of -2·1% [-4·7 to 0·5], p=0·13) but lower specificity (difference of 3·0% [1·7 to 4·3], p<0·0001). IOTA SRRisk model at 10% had similar sensitivity (difference of -4·3% [-11·0 to -2·3], p=0·23) but lower specificity (difference of 16·2% [12·6 to 19·8], p<0·0001). IOTA Simple Rules had similar sensitivity (difference of -1·6% [-9·3 to 6·2], p=0·82) and specificity (difference of -2·2% [-5·1 to 0·6], p=0·14). CA125 at 35 IU/mL had similar sensitivity (difference of -2·1% [-6·6 to 2·3], p=0·42) but higher specificity (difference of 6·7% [4·3 to 9·1], p<0·0001). In a post-hoc analysis, when compared with RMI1 at 250, ORADS achieved similar sensitivity (difference of -2·1%, 95% CI -8·6 to 4·3, p=0·60) and lower specificity (difference of 10·2%, 95% CI 6·8 to 13·6, p<0·0001). In view of its higher sensitivity than RMI1 at 250, despite some loss in specificity, we recommend that IOTA ADNEX at 10% should be considered as the new standard-of-care diagnostic in ovarian cancer for postmenopausal patients.

39356481,"Quantitative Prostate MRI, From the ",AJR. American journal of roentgenology,2025,"Prostate MRI has traditionally relied on qualitative interpretation. However, quantitative components hold the potential to markedly improve performance. The ADC from DWI is probably the most widely recognized quantitative MRI biomarker and has shown strong discriminatory value for clinically significant prostate cancer as well as for recurrent cancer after treatment. Advanced diffusion techniques, including intravoxel incoherent motion imaging, diffusion kurtosis imaging, diffusion-tensor imaging, and specific implementations such as restriction spectrum imaging, purport even better discrimination but are more technically challenging. The inherent T1 and T2 of tissue also provide diagnostic value, with more advanced techniques deriving luminal water fraction and hybrid multidimensional MRI metrics. Dynamic contrast-enhanced imaging, primarily using a modified Tofts model, also shows independent discriminatory value. Finally, quantitative lesion size and shape features can be combined with the aforementioned techniques and can be further refined using radiomics, texture analysis, and artificial intelligence. Which technique will ultimately find widespread clinical use will depend on validation across a myriad of platforms and use cases.",1256
39352285,Diagnostic Accuracy of Screening Contrast-enhanced Mammography for Women with Extremely Dense Breasts at Increased Risk of Breast Cancer.,Radiology,2024,"Background Mammogram interpretation is challenging in female patients with extremely dense breasts (Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System [BI-RADS] category D), who have a higher breast cancer risk. Contrast-enhanced mammography (CEM) has recently emerged as a potential alternative; however, data regarding CEM utility in this subpopulation are limited. Purpose To evaluate the diagnostic performance of CEM for breast cancer screening in female patients with extremely dense breasts. Materials and Methods This retrospective single-institution study included consecutive CEM examinations in asymptomatic female patients with extremely dense breasts performed from December 2012 to March 2022. From CEM examinations, low-energy (LE) images were the equivalent of a two-dimensional full-field digital mammogram. Recombined images highlighting areas of contrast enhancement were constructed using a postprocessing algorithm. The sensitivity and specificity of LE images and CEM images (ie, including both LE and recombined images) were calculated and compared using the McNemar test. Results This study included 1299 screening CEM examinations (609 female patients; mean age, 50 years ± 9 [SD]). Sixteen screen-detected cancers were diagnosed, and two interval cancers occured. Five cancers were depicted at LE imaging and an additional 11 cancers were depicted at CEM (incremental cancer detection rate, 8.7 cancers per 1000 examinations). CEM sensitivity was 88.9% (16 of 18; 95% CI: 65.3, 98.6), which was higher than the LE examination sensitivity of 27.8% (five of 18; 95% CI: 9.7, 53.5) (",1596
39349725,CT assessed morphological features can predict higher mitotic index in gastric gastrointestinal stromal tumors.,European radiology,2025,"To investigate the correlation of the mitotic index (MI) of 1-5 cm gastric gastrointestinal stromal tumors (gGISTs) with CT-identified morphological and first-order radiomics features, incorporating subgroup analysis based on tumor size. We enrolled 344 patients across four institutions, each pathologically diagnosed with 1-5 cm gGISTs and undergoing preoperative contrast-enhanced CT scans. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to investigate the independent CT morphological high-risk features of MI. Lesions were categorized into four subgroups based on their pathological LD: 1-2 cm (n = 69), 2-3 cm (n = 96), 3-4 cm (n = 107), and 4-5 cm (n = 72). CT morphological high-risk features of MI were evaluated in each subgroup. In addition, first-order radiomics features were extracted on CT images of the venous phase, and the association between these features and MI was investigated. Tumor size (p = 0.04, odds ratio, 1.41; 95% confidence interval: 1.01-1.96) and invasive margin (p < 0.01, odds ratio, 4.55; 95% confidence interval: 1.77-11.73) emerged as independent high-risk features for MI > 5 of 1-5 cm gGISTs from multivariate analysis. In the subgroup analysis, the invasive margin was correlated with MI > 5 in 3-4 cm and 4-5 cm gGISTs (p = 0.02, p = 0.03), and potentially correlated with MI > 5 in 2-3 cm gGISTs (p = 0.07). The energy was the sole first-order radiomics feature significantly correlated with gGISTs of MI > 5, displaying a strong correlation with CT-detected tumor size (Pearson's ρ = 0.85, p < 0.01). The invasive margin stands out as the sole independent CT morphological high-risk feature for 1-5 cm gGISTs after tumor size-based subgroup analysis, overshadowing intratumoral morphological characteristics and first-order radiomics features. Question How can accurate preoperative risk stratification of gGISTs be achieved to support treatment decision-making? Findings Invasive margins may serve as a reliable marker for risk prediction in gGISTs up to 5 cm, rather than surface ulceration, irregular shape, necrosis, or heterogeneous enhancement. Clinical relevance For gGISTs measuring up to 5 cm, preoperative prediction of the metastatic risk could help select patients who could be treated by endoscopic resection, thereby avoiding overtreatment.",2304
39349724,MR elastography vs a combination of common non-invasive tests for estimation of severe liver fibrosis in patients with hepatobiliary tumors.,European radiology,2025,"To evaluate the accuracy of combined imaging and blood test indices related to liver fibrosis (LF) compared to magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) for estimating severe LF (F3-4) in preoperative patients. This retrospective study included patients who underwent MRE, gadolinium ethoxybenzyl diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (Gd-EOB-DTPA)-enhanced MRI, and dynamic CT before liver resection. Liver stiffness measurement (LSM) using MRE, liver-to-spleen signal intensity ratio (LSR) using Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI, and spleen volume normalized to body surface area (SV/BSA) using CT volumetry were measured. Laboratory parameters, including levels of type IV collagen 7S and hyaluronic acid, were also measured. Logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic analyses were performed to identify parameters that could estimate severe LF more accurately than LSM alone. A total of 81 patients (mean age, 67 years ± 9.9 [SD]; 58 men) were enrolled. Multivariable logistic regression analysis indicated that LSR (odds ratio [OR]: 0.14, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.05-0.37, p < 0.001), SV/BSA (OR: 1.25, 95% CI: 1.02-1.52, p = 0.03) and type IV collagen 7S (OR: 1.84, 95% CI: 1.12-3.00, p = 0.02) were associated with severe LF. Receiver operating characteristic analysis showed that for estimating severe LF, the area under the curve was significantly larger for the combination of LSR, SV/BSA, and type IV collagen 7S than for LSM alone (0.95 vs 0.85, p = 0.04). The combined evaluation of LSR, SV/BSA, and type IV collagen 7S obtained by clinically common preoperative examinations was more accurate than MRE alone for estimating severe LF in preoperative patients. Question What indicators among the imaging and blood tests commonly performed preoperatively can provide a more accurate estimate of severe LF compared to MRE? Findings The combination of LSR, SV/BSA, and type IV collagen 7S was more accurate than an LSM alone for estimating severe LF.

Second, to compare patient sex and age, lesion location, and rates of primary treatment failure for OO based on histopathology results. A retrospective review was performed of all first-time combined CT-guided biopsy/RFA for presumed OO at a single academic center between January 1990 and August 2023. Lesions were characterized as ""biopsy-confirmed OO"", ""OO-mimicking"", or ""non-diagnostic"" based on pathology results. Treatment failure was defined as residual or recurrent symptoms requiring follow-up surgery or procedural intervention. Variables of interest were compared between pathology groups using Kruskal-Wallis, Fisher's exact, and Wilcoxon rank sum tests. Of 643 included patients (median 18 years old, IQR: 13-24 years, 458 male), there were 445 (69.1%) biopsy-confirmed OO, 184 (28.6%) non-diagnostic lesions, and 15 (2.3%) OO-mimicking lesions. OO-mimicking lesions included chondroblastoma (n = 4), chondroma (n = 3), enchondroma (n = 2), non-ossifying fibroma (n = 2), Brodie's abscess (n = 1), eosinophilic granuloma (n = 1), fibrous dysplasia (n = 1), and unspecified carcinoma (n = 1). OO-mimicking lesions did not show male predominance (46.7% male) like biopsy-proven OO (74.1% male) (p = 0.033). Treatment failure occurred in 24 (5.4%) biopsy-confirmed OO, 8 (4.4%) non-diagnostic lesions, and 2 (13.3%) OO-mimicking lesions without a significant difference by overall biopsy result (p = 0.24) or pairwise group comparison. OO-mimicking pathology is infrequent, typically benign, but potentially malignant. OO-mimicking lesions do not exhibit male predominance. There was no significant difference in RFA treatment failure or lesion location among lesions with imaging appearances suggestive of OO. Question What is the frequency and spectrum of OO-mimicking lesions among presumed OO and what, if any, differences exist between these pathologies? Finding The study cohort included 69.1% OO, 28.6% lesions with non-diagnostic histopathology, and 2.3% OO-mimicking lesions. There was no difference in treatment failure or location among lesions.

Ultrasound-guided biopsy may miss a sizeable portion of clinically significant prostate cancer, while magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) improves its detection. This study aimed to investigate demographic and socioeconomic status-related factors influencing MRI use for prostate cancer detection. Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program-Medicare data were used to assess use of prediagnostic MRI in 90 908 patients with a diagnosis of primary prostate cancer (2012-2019). Modified Poisson regression models adjusted for socioeconomic factors such as income, education, Medicare buy-in, and dual eligibility, were used to examine factors associated with MRI use. All statistical tests were 2 sided. Prediagnostic MRI use increased substantially between 2012 (3.8%) and 2019 (32.6%). The disparity in utilization between non-Hispanic Black and non-Hispanic White patients decreased by more than half, from 43% (relative risk [RR] = 0.57, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.48 to 0.67) in 2012 to 20% (RR = 0.80, 95% CI = 0.74 to 0.86) in 2019. Rural residents were 35% less likely (RR = 0.65, 95% CI = 0.61 to 0.69) to undergo MRI, while individuals in the US Census Central (vs West) region of the United States were 49% less likely (RR = 0.49, 95% CI = 0.48 to 0.51). No significant disparities in MRI use were identified between individuals 75 years of age and older and individuals aged 64 to 75 years. Socioeconomic status factors associated with MRI use were income, education, Medicare buy-in, and dual eligibility. This study revealed increased MRI utilization over time, including among individuals 75 years of age and older. Racial disparities decreased, while wide urban-rural disparities remained. Targeted public health interventions should focus on geographical factors because urban or rural designations and US region were associated with the most prominent disparities. Future research should explore pathways contributing to these disparities by using a multidisciplinary approach, including geographical studies, to help eliminate health-care inequities.",2142

Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated to evaluate the diagnostic performance of conventional MRI and the IVIM-DKI-added model. A total of 59 participants (median age: 58.00 years [IQR: 52.00, 62.00]; 38 [64%] men) were evaluated, including 21 pCR and 38 non-pCR cases. The histogram parameters of DKI, including skewness of kurtosis post-NAT (post-K IVIM and DKI provide added value in the evaluation of CR to NAT in LARC. Question The current conventional imaging evaluation system lacks adequacy for assessing CR to NAT in LARC. Findings Significantly improved diagnostic performance was observed with the histogram analysis of IVIM and DKI in conjunction with conventional MRI. Clinical relevance IVIM and DKI provide significant value in evaluating CR to NAT in LARC, which bears significant implications for reducing surgical complications and facilitating organ preservation.",1698
39294304,Real-world response assessment of immune checkpoint inhibition: comparing iRECIST and RECIST 1.1 in melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer patients.,European radiology,2025,"To compare immune response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (iRECIST) and response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) 1.1 for response assessment of immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy in a real-world setting in patients with melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Two-hundred fifty-two patients with melanoma and NSCLC who received CTLA-4 inhibitor ipilimumab or PD-1 inhibitors nivolumab or pembrolizumab and who underwent staging CT of the chest and abdomen were retrospectively included. Treatment response evaluation according to the RECIST 1.1 and iRECIST guidelines was performed for all patients. Response patterns, as well as overall response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), and time to progression (TTP), were compared between RECIST 1.1 and iRECIST. Out of 143 patients with progressive disease (PD) according to RECIST 1.1, 48 (33.6%) did not attain confirmation of progression (iCPD) as per iRECIST and six patients who were treated beyond RECIST 1.1 progression reached PD at a later point in time in iRECIST, resulting in a significant difference in TTP between iRECIST and RECIST 1.1 (618.3 ± 626.9 days vs. 538.1 ± 617.9 days, respectively (p < 0.05)). The number of non-responders as per RECIST 1.1 was 79, whereas it was 60 when using iRECIST. ORR was 28.5% for RECIST 1.1 and 34.1% for iRECIST, and corresponding DCR of 67.4% for RECIST 1.1 and 74.6% for iRECIST. iRECIST was more suitable than RECIST 1.1 for capturing atypical response patterns to ICI therapy in patients with melanoma and NSCLC, resulting in differences in the assessment of treatment response. Compared to RECIST 1.1, iRECIST may improve patient care and treatment decisions for patients with NSCLC or melanoma who are treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors in clinical routine. RECIST 1.1 may incorrectly assess atypical treatment patterns to immune checkpoint inhibitors. iRECIST better captured atypical response patterns compared to RECIST 1.1. iRECIST was more suitable for assessing response to immune checkpoint inhibitors in non-small cell lung carcinoma and melanoma.",2107
39288075,CD24-Targeted NIR-II Fluorescence Imaging Enables Early Detection of Colorectal Neoplasia.,Cancer research,2024,"Colorectal cancer continues to be a major health issue even though screening methods have facilitated early detection. Despite the high sensitivity of white-light colonoscopy, it frequently overlooks invasive flat or depressed lesions, which can lead to the development of larger, advanced tumors. Fluorescence molecular imaging offers a promising approach for early tumor detection by targeting specific molecular characteristics of lesions. CD24 is upregulated during the adenoma-to-colorectal cancer transition, providing a potential target for fluorescence molecular imaging. In this study, we developed a second near-infrared window (NIR-II) fluorescent probe with a high affinity for CD24 and evaluated its efficacy and targeting ability in cellular models, murine models, and clinical samples of colorectal cancer. CD24 expression was elevated in 76% of adenomas and 80% of colorectal cancers. In a colitis-associated cancer mouse model, NIR-II imaging with the CD24-targeted probe achieved a significantly higher tumor-to-background ratio compared with conventional NIR-I imaging. The probe demonstrated exceptional sensitivity (92%) and specificity (92%) for detecting colorectal cancer, including small lesions less than 1 mm in size. This led to the identification of precancerous lesions missed by white-light detection and lesions missed by NIR-I imaging. Moreover, ex vivo human tissue incubation with the probe supported the potential for intraprocedural lesion identification via topical probe application during colonoscopy. In conclusion, this study successfully demonstrates the potential of CD24-targeted NIR-II imaging for identifying colorectal neoplasia, highlighting its significance for early colorectal cancer detection in the gastrointestinal tract. Significance: Overexpression of CD24 in colorectal dysplasia provides the opportunity to use an NIR-II fluorescent probe targeting CD24 to detect colorectal neoplasms, including invisible lesions that are missed by white-light colonoscopy.",2016

Patients with known or suspected FLL were prospectively (registry number 276_19 B) included from October to December 2019 in this study, out of which 32 had liver lesions. Echo planar spin-echo DWI data both with TRIG and FB were with approximately constant acquisition times acquired at 1.5 T. Lesions were segmented in the b = 800 s/mm² images in both the TRIG and FB images. The lesion size, location (liver segment), liver lesion visibility, as well as contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) were recorded. The CNR was assessed with the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test and the number of visible lesions with the Fisher test. Data from 43 patients (22 female) were analyzed. The mean patient age was 58 ± 14 years. A total of 885 FLL (N Respiration triggering can improve the detection of small liver lesions with diameters up to approx. 1 cm in the whole liver. Question Can respiration triggering (TRIG) improve the detection of small FLL compared to FB diffusion-weighted imaging? Findings Among 885 segmented FLL, TRIG was superior to FB for lesions smaller than 8 mm and had improved CNR and visibility. Clinical relevance Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging is used for the detection of focal liver lesions and image quality is influenced by breathing motion.

39287522,AI for Multistructure Incidental Findings and Mortality Prediction at Chest CT in Lung Cancer Screening.,Radiology,2024,"Background Incidental extrapulmonary findings are commonly detected on chest CT scans and can be clinically important. Purpose To integrate artificial intelligence (AI)-based segmentation for multiple structures, coronary artery calcium (CAC), and epicardial adipose tissue with automated feature extraction methods and machine learning to detect extrapulmonary abnormalities and predict all-cause mortality (ACM) in a large multicenter cohort. Materials and Methods In this post hoc analysis, baseline chest CT scans in patients enrolled in the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) from August 2002 to September 2007 were included from 33 participating sites. Per scan, 32 structures were segmented with a multistructure model. For each structure, 15 clinically interpretable radiomic features were quantified. Four general codes describing abnormalities reported by NLST radiologists were applied to identify extrapulmonary significant incidental findings on the CT scans. Death at 2-year and 10-year follow-up and the presence of extrapulmonary significant incidental findings were predicted with ensemble AI models, and individualized structure risk scores were evaluated.

However, it is unclear whether additional tumor detection will improve outcomes or lead to overdiagnosis of breast cancer. Purpose This study aimed to compare cancer types and stages over 3 years of DM screening and 10 years of DBT screening to determine the effect of DBT. Materials and Methods A retrospective search identified breast cancers detected by using screening mammography from August 2008 through July 2021. Data collected included demographic, imaging, and pathologic information. Invasive cancers 2 cm or larger, human epidermal growth factor 2-positive or triple-negative tumors greater than 10 mm, axillary nodes positive for cancer, and distant organ spread were considered advanced cancers. The DBT and DM cohorts were compared and further analyzed by prevalent versus incident examinations. False-negative findings were also assessed.

39285027,The prognostic value of lymphovascular invasion for stage I lung adenocarcinoma based on the presence of ground-glass opacity.,European radiology,2025,"There is still a debate regarding the prognostic implication of lymphovascular invasion (LVI) in stage I lung adenocarcinoma. Ground-glass opacity (GGO) on CT is known to correlate with a less invasive or lepidic component in adenocarcinoma, which may influence the strength of prognostic factors. This study aimed to explore the prognostic value of LVI in stage I lung adenocarcinoma based on the presence of GGO. Stage I lung adenocarcinoma patients receiving lobectomy between 2010 and 2019 were retrospectively categorized as GGO-positive or GGO-negative (solid adenocarcinoma) on CT. Multivariable Cox regression analyses were performed for disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) to evaluate the prognostic significance of pathologic LVI based on the presence of GGO. Of 924 patients included (mean age, 62.5 ± 9.2 years; 505 women), 525 (56.8%) exhibited GGO-positive adenocarcinoma and 116 (12.6%) were diagnosed with LVI. LVI was significantly more frequent in solid than GGO-positive adenocarcinoma (20.1% vs. 6.9%, p < 0.001). Multivariable analysis identified LVI and visceral pleural invasion (VPI) as significant prognostic factors for shorter DFS among solid adenocarcinoma patients (LVI, hazard ratio (HR): 1.89, p = 0.004; VPI, HR: 1.65, p = 0.003) but not GGO-positive patients (p = 0.76 and p = 0.87). In contrast, LVI was not a significant prognostic factor for OS in either group (p > 0.05). In stage I lung adenocarcinoma, pathologic LVI was associated with DFS only in patients with solid lung adenocarcinoma. Lymphovascular invasion (LVI) significantly affects disease-free survival in solid-stage I lung adenocarcinoma patients, but not those with ground-glass opacity (GGO) adenocarcinoma. Risk stratification considering both GGO on CT and LVI may identify patients benefiting from increased surveillance. The presence of ground-glass opacity portends different prognoses for lung adenocarcinoma. In stage I lung adenocarcinoma, lymphovascular invasion (LVI) was significantly more frequent in solid adenocarcinomas than in ground-glass opacity (GGO)-positive adenocarcinomas. LVI was not associated with overall survival in patients with either solid adenocarcinomas or GGO adenocarcinomas.",2232

39269474,MRI characteristics predict risk of pathological upgrade in patients with ISUP grade group 1 prostate cancer.,European radiology,2025,"This study aims to analyse multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) characteristics of patients diagnosed with ISUP grade group (GG) 1 prostate cancer (PC) on initial target plus systematic MRI/TRUS fusion-guided biopsy and investigate histopathological progression during follow-up. A retrospective single-centre cohort analysis was conducted on consecutive patients with mpMRI visible lesions (PI-RADS ≥ 3) and detection of ISUP-1-PC at the time of initial biopsy. The study assessed clinical, mpMRI, and histopathological parameters. Subcohorts were analysed with (1) patients who had confirmed ISUP-1-PC and (2) patients who experienced histopathological upgrading to ISUP ≥ 2 PC during follow-up either at re-biopsy or radical prostatectomy (RP). A total of 156 patients (median age 65 years) between March 2014 and August 2021 were included. Histopathological upgrading to ISUP ≥ 2 was detected in 55% of patients during a median follow-up of 9.5 months (IQR 2.2-16.4). When comparing subgroups with an ISUP upgrade and sustained ISUP 1 PC, they differed significantly in contact length of the index lesion to the pseudocapsule, ADC value, PI-RADS category, and the MRI grading group (mGG) (p < 0.05). In the ISUP GG ≥ 2 subgroup, 91% of men had PI-RADS category 4 or 5 and 82% exhibited the highest mGG (mGG3). In multivariate analysis, mGG was the only independent parameter for predicting ISUP ≥ 2-PC in these patients. MRI reveals important information about PC aggressiveness and should be incorporated into clinical decision-making when ISUP-1-PC is diagnosed. In cases of specific MRI characteristics adverse to the histopathology, early re-biopsy might be considered. In cases with clear MRI characteristics for clinically significant prostate cancer (e.g., mGG 3 and/or PI-RADS 5, cT3, or clear focal PI-RADS 4 lesions on MRI) and ISUP GG 1 PC diagnosed on initial prostate biopsy, MRI findings should be incorporated into clinical decision-making and early re-biopsy (e.g., within 6 months) might be considered.

39266769,MRI and active surveillance: thoughts from across the pond.,European radiology,2025,"In the United States (US), urological guidelines recommend active surveillance (AS) for patients with low-risk prostate cancer (PCa) and endorse it as an option for those with favorable intermediate-risk PCa with a > 10-year life expectancy. Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) is being increasingly used in the screening, monitoring, and staging of PCa and involves the combination of T2-weighted, diffusion-weighted, and dynamic contrast-enhanced T1-weighted imaging. The American Urological Association (AUA) guidelines provide recommendations about the use of mpMRI in the confirmatory setting for AS patients but do not discuss the timing of follow-up mpMRI in AS. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) discourages using it more frequently than every 12 months. Finally, guidelines state that mpMRI can be used to augment risk stratification but should not replace periodic surveillance biopsy. In this review, we discuss the current literature regarding the use of mpMRI for patients with AS, with a particular focus on the approach in the US. Although AS shows a benefit to the addition of mpMRI to diagnostic, confirmatory, and follow-up biopsy, there is no strong evidence to suggest that mpMRI can safely replace biopsy for most patients and thus it must be incorporated into a multimodal approach. CLINICAL RELEVANCE STATEMENT: According to the US guidelines, regular follow-ups are important for men with prostate cancer on active surveillance, and prostate MRI is a valuable tool that should be utilized, in combination with PSA kinetics and biopsies, for monitoring prostate cancer. KEY POINTS: According to the US guidelines, the addition of MRI improves the detection of clinically significant prostate cancer. Timing interval imaging of patients on active surveillance remains unclear and has not been specifically addressed. MRI should trigger further work-ups, but not replace periodic follow-up biopsies, in men on active surveillance.",1981
39254448,Development and Validation of a Contrast-Enhanced US VI-RADS for Evaluating Muscle Invasion in Bladder Cancer.,Radiology,2024,"Background Contrast-enhanced US (CEUS) can be used preoperatively for evaluating muscle invasion in bladder cancer, which is important for determining appropriate treatment. However, diagnostic criteria for assessing this at CEUS have not been standardized. Purpose To develop and validate a CEUS Vesical Imaging Reporting and Data System (VI-RADS) for evaluating muscle invasion in bladder cancer. Materials and Methods This single-center prospective study consecutively enrolled patients with suspected bladder cancer. Participants underwent transabdominal or intracavity CEUS between July 2021 and May 2023. Participants were divided into a training set and a validation set at a 2:1 ratio based on the chronologic order of enrollment. The training set was used to identify major imaging features to include in CEUS VI-RADS, and the likelihood of muscle invasion per category was determined using a pathologic reference standard. The optimal VI-RADS category cutoff for muscle invasion was determined with use of the maximum Youden index. The validation set was assessed by novice and expert readers and used to validate the diagnostic performance and interreader agreement of the developed system. Results Overall, 126 participants (median age, 64 years [IQR, 57-71 years]; 107 male) and 67 participants (median age, 64 years [IQR, 56-69 years]; 49 male) were included in the training and validation set, respectively. In the training set, the optimal CEUS VI-RADS category cutoff for muscle invasion was VI-RADS 4 or higher (Youden index, 0.77). In the validation set, CEUS VI-RADS achieved good performance for both novice and expert readers (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.80 [95% CI: 0.70, 0.90] vs 0.88 [95% CI: 0.80, 0.97]; ",1761
39254446,Combining Radiomics and Autoencoders to Distinguish Benign and Malignant Breast Tumors on US Images.,Radiology,2024,"Background US is clinically established for breast imaging, but its diagnostic performance depends on operator experience. Computer-assisted (real-time) image analysis may help in overcoming this limitation. Purpose To develop precise real-time-capable US-based breast tumor categorization by combining classic radiomics and autoencoder-based features from automatically localized lesions. Materials and Methods A total of 1619 B-mode US images of breast tumors were retrospectively analyzed between April 2018 and January 2024. nnU-Net was trained for lesion segmentation. Features were extracted from tumor segments, bounding boxes, and whole images using either classic radiomics, autoencoder, or both. Feature selection was performed to generate radiomics signatures, which were used to train machine learning algorithms for tumor categorization. Models were evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity and were statistically compared with histopathologically or follow-up-confirmed diagnosis. Results The model was developed on 1191 (mean age, 61 years ± 14 [SD]) female patients and externally validated on 50 (mean age, 55 years ± 15]). The development data set was divided into two parts: testing and training lesion segmentation (419 and 179 examinations) and lesion categorization (503 and 90 examinations). nnU-Net demonstrated precision and reproducibility in lesion segmentation in test set of data set 1 (median Dice score [DS]: 0.90 [IQR, 0.84-0.93]; ",1533
39251443,Cystic splenic lesions: a sonographic approach-retrospective study in 111 patients.,European radiology,2025,"To describe and categorize splenic cystic-appearing lesions (S-CAL) with B-mode and contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS). This retrospective study investigated S-CALs in 111 patients between 2003 and 2023 in an interdisciplinary ultrasound center with B-mode ultrasound, color Doppler sonography (CDS), and CEUS. S-CAL was characterized by echogenicity, diameter, and shape, as well as additional features like septation, calcification, or wall thickening, and CDS/CEUS were used to identify perfusion. Histological examination or imaging follow-up was necessary to determine the nature of S-CAL. Moreover, 'S-CAL with risk' was defined, necessitating further procedures. Four types (0-III) of S-CALs were defined based on ultrasound parameters. Fisher's exact test was used to compare non-parametric data. S-CAL of 111 patients (58 female, 53 men-average age: 58.6 years) was examined. Final diagnoses were: splenic cyst (n = 64, 57.7%); splenic abscess (n = 10, 9.0%); intrasplenic pseudoaneurysm (n = 10, 9.0%); splenic metastasis (n = 10, 9.0%); splenic infarction (n = 6, 5.4%); splenic hematoma (n = 4, 3.6%); other (n = 7, 6.3%). S-CAL groupings were type 0 (n = 11, 9.9%), type I (n = 33, 29.7%), type II (n = 24, 21.6%), and type III (n = 43, 38.7%). 'S-CAL with risk' was diagnosed in n = 41 (36.9%). Malignant S-CAL was only seen in type II (n = 2, 8.2%) and type III (n = 9, 20.9%) (p < 0.001). 'S-CALs with risk' were found more frequently in type 0 (n = 11, 100%), type II (n = 16, 66.7%) and type III (n = 13, 30.2%) than in type I (n = 1, 3%) (p < 0.001). B-mode ultrasound, CDS, and CEUS are useful to further characterize and follow-up S-CAL and identify 'S-CAL with risk', requiring further procedures. Ultrasound imaging is valuable for the detection, categorization, and monitoring of cystic-appearing lesions of the spleen, as well as for the identification of those with risk. An S-CAL may introduce uncertainty in clinical practice as imaging-based risk stratification is missing. B-mode and CEUS, along with the clinical context and follow-up, assist in characterizing and identifying 'S-CAL with risk'. S-CALs encompass various lesions, including simple cysts, metastases, abscesses, and intrasplenic pseudoaneurysms.",2242
39251442,Shape matters: unsupervised exploration of IDH-wildtype glioma imaging survival predictors.,European radiology,2025,"This study examines clustering based on shape radiomic features and tumor volume to identify IDH-wildtype glioma phenotypes and assess their impact on overall survival (OS). This retrospective study included 436 consecutive patients diagnosed with IDH-wt glioma who underwent preoperative MR imaging. Alongside the total tumor volume, nine distinct shape radiomic features were extracted using the PyRadiomics framework. Different imaging phenotypes were identified using partition around medoids (PAM) clustering on the training dataset (348/436). The prognostic efficacy of these phenotypes in predicting OS was evaluated on the test dataset (88/436). External validation was performed using the public UCSF glioma dataset (n = 397). A decision-tree algorithm was employed to determine the relevance of features associated with cluster affiliation. PAM clustering identified two clusters in the training dataset: Cluster 1 (n = 233) had a higher proportion of patients with higher sphericity and elongation, while Cluster 2 (n = 115) had a higher proportion of patients with higher maximum 3D diameter, surface area, axis lengths, and tumor volume (p < 0.001 for each). OS differed significantly between clusters: Cluster 1 showed a median OS of 23.8 compared to 11.4 months of Cluster 2 in the holdout test dataset (p = 0.002). Multivariate Cox regression showed improved performance with cluster affiliation over clinical data alone (C index 0.67 vs 0.59, p = 0.003). Cluster-based models outperformed the models with tumor volume alone (evidence ratio: 5.16-5.37). Data-driven clustering reveals imaging phenotypes, highlighting the improved prognostic power of combining shape-radiomics with tumor volume, thereby outperforming predictions based on tumor volume alone in high-grade glioma survival outcomes. Shape-radiomics and volume-based cluster analyses of preoperative MRI scans can reveal imaging phenotypes that improve the prediction of OS in patients with IDH-wild type gliomas, outperforming currently known models based on tumor size alone or clinical parameters. Shape radiomics and tumor volume clustering in IDH-wildtype gliomas are investigated for enhanced prognostic accuracy. Two distinct phenotypic clusters were identified with different median OSs. Integrating shape radiomics and volume-based clustering enhances OS prediction in IDH-wildtype glioma patients.",2387
39235653,MRI-based prediction of the need for wide resection margins in patients with single hepatocellular carcinoma.,European radiology,2025,"To develop an MRI-based score that enables individualized predictions of the survival benefit of wide over narrow resection margins. This single-center retrospective study (December 2011 to May 2022) included consecutive patients who underwent curative-intent resection for single Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) 0/A HCC and preoperative contrast-enhanced MRI. In patients with narrow resection margins, preoperative demographic, laboratory, and MRI variables independently associated with early recurrence-free survival (RFS) were identified using Cox regression analyses, which were employed to develop a predictive score (named ""MARGIN""). Survival outcomes were compared between wide and narrow resection margins in a propensity-score matched cohort for the score-stratified low- and high-risk groups, respectively. Four hundred nineteen patients (median age, 54 years; 361 men) were included, 282 (67.3%) undergoing narrow resection margins. In patients with narrow resection margins, age, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) > 400 ng/mL, protein induced by vitamin K absence or antagonist-II (PIVKA-II) > 200 mAU/mL, radiological involvement of liver capsule, and infiltrative appearance were associated with early RFS (p values, 0.002-0.04) and formed the MARGIN score with a testing dataset C-index of 0.75 (95% CI: 0.65-0.84). In the matched cohort, wide resection margin was associated with improved early RFS rate for the high-risk group (MARGIN score ≥ - 1.3; 71.1% vs 41.0%; p = 0.02), but not for the low-risk group (MARGIN score < - 1.3; 79.7% vs 76.1%; p = 0.36). In patients with single BCLC 0/A HCC, the MARGIN score may serve as promising decision-making to indicate the need for wide resection margins. The MARGIN score has the potential to identify patients who would benefit more from wide resection margins than narrow resection margins, improving the postoperative survival of patients with single BCLC 0/A hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Age, AFP, PIVKA-II, radiological involvement of liver capsule, and infiltrative appearance were associated with early RFS and formed the MARGIN score. The MARGIN score achieved a testing dataset C-index of 0.75. Wide resection margins were associated with improved early RFS for the high-risk group, but not for the low-risk group.",2286
39230403,"Whole-Body Multiparametric PET in Clinical Oncology: Current Status, Challenges, and Opportunities.",AJR. American journal of roentgenology,2024,"The interpretation of clinical oncologic PET studies has historically used static reconstructions based on SUVs. SUVs and SUV-based images have important limitations, including dependence on uptake times and reduced conspicuity of tracer-avid lesions in organs with high background uptake. The acquisition of dynamic PET images enables additional PET reconstructions via Patlak modeling, which assumes that a tracer is irreversibly trapped by tissues of interest. The resulting multiparametric PET images capture a tracer's net trapping rate and apparent volume of distribution, separating the contributions of bound and free tracer fractions to the PET signal captured in the SUV. Potential benefits of multiparametric PET include higher quantitative stability, superior lesion conspicuity, and greater accuracy for differentiating malignant and benign lesions. However, the imaging protocols necessary for multiparametric PET are inherently more complex and time intensive, despite the recent introduction of automated or semiautomated scanner-based reconstruction packages. In this Review, we examine the current state of multiparametric PET in whole-body oncologic imaging. We summarize the Patlak method and relevant tracer kinetics, discuss clinical workflows and protocol considerations, and highlight clinical challenges and opportunities. We aim to help oncologic imagers make informed decisions about whether to implement multiparametric PET in their clinical practices.",1480

Preclinical data have shown its safety and technical success in the ablation of liver tumors. Purpose To evaluate the safety and technical success of histotripsy in destroying primary or metastatic liver tumors. Materials and Methods The parallel United States and European Union and England #HOPE4LIVER trials were prospective, multicenter, single-arm studies. Eligible patients were recruited at 14 sites in Europe and the United States from January 2021 to July 2022. Up to three tumors smaller than 3 cm in size could be treated. CT or MRI and clinic visits were performed at 1 week or less preprocedure, at index-procedure, 36 hours or less postprocedure, and 30 days postprocedure. There were co-primary end points of technical success of tumor treatment and absence of procedure-related major complications within 30 days, with performance goals of greater than 70% and less than 25%, respectively.

39225603,MRI Predicts Residual Disease and Outcomes in Watch-and-Wait Patients with Rectal Cancer.,Radiology,2024,"Background MRI plays a crucial role in restaging locally advanced rectal cancer treated with total neoadjuvant therapy (TNT); however, prospective studies have not evaluated its ability to accurately select patients for nonoperative management. Purpose To evaluate the ability of restaging MRI to predict oncologic outcomes and identify imaging features associated with residual disease (RD) after TNT. Materials and Methods This was a secondary analysis of the Organ Preservation in Rectal Adenocarcinoma (OPRA) trial, which randomized participants from April 2014 to March 2020 with stages II or III rectal adenocarcinoma to undergo either induction or consolidation TNT. Participants enrolled in the OPRA trial who underwent restaging MRI were eligible for inclusion in the present study. Radiologists classified participants as having clinical complete response (cCR), near-complete clinical response (nCR), or incomplete clinical response (iCR) based on restaging MRI at a mean of 8 weeks ± 4 (SD) after treatment. Oncologic outcomes according to MRI response category were assessed using Kaplan-Meier curves. Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify imaging characteristics associated with RD. Results A total of 277 participants (median age, 58 years [IQR, 17 years]; 179 male) who were randomized in the OPRA trial had restaging MRI forms completed. The median follow-up duration was 4.1 years. Participants with cCR had higher rates of organ preservation compared with those with nCR (65.3% vs 41.6%, log-rank ",1533
39225600,Automated Interstitial Lung Abnormality Probability Prediction at CT: A Stepwise Machine Learning Approach in the Boston Lung Cancer Study.,Radiology,2024,"Background It is increasingly recognized that interstitial lung abnormalities (ILAs) detected at CT have potential clinical implications, but automated identification of ILAs has not yet been fully established. Purpose To develop and test automated ILA probability prediction models using machine learning techniques on CT images. Materials and Methods This secondary analysis of a retrospective study included CT scans from patients in the Boston Lung Cancer Study collected between February 2004 and June 2017. Visual assessment of ILAs by two radiologists and a pulmonologist served as the ground truth. Automated ILA probability prediction models were developed that used a stepwise approach involving section inference and case inference models. The section inference model produced an ILA probability for each CT section, and the case inference model integrated these probabilities to generate the case-level ILA probability. For indeterminate sections and cases, both two- and three-label methods were evaluated. For the case inference model, we tested three machine learning classifiers (support vector machine [SVM], random forest [RF], and convolutional neural network [CNN]). Receiver operating characteristic analysis was performed to calculate the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Results A total of 1382 CT scans (mean patient age, 67 years ± 11 [SD]; 759 women) were included. Of the 1382 CT scans, 104 (8%) were assessed as having ILA, 492 (36%) as indeterminate for ILA, and 786 (57%) as without ILA according to ground-truth labeling. The cohort was divided into a training set (",1626

Adhering to PRISMA and AMSTAR guidelines, we systematically reviewed literature from March 2012 to December 2023 using databases including PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase. Radiomics studies utilizing computed tomography (CT) and positron emission tomography (PET)/CT imaging were included. The quality of studies was appraised with QUADAS-2 and RQS tools, and the TRIPOD checklist assessed model transparency. Sensitivity, specificity, and AUC values were synthesized to determine diagnostic performance, with subgroup and sensitivity analyses probing heterogeneity and a Fagan plot evaluating clinical applicability. Our analysis incorporated 42 cohorts from 22 studies. CT-based radiomics demonstrated a sensitivity of 0.84 (95% CI: 0.79-0.88, p < 0.01) and specificity of 0.82 (95% CI: 0.75-0.87, p < 0.01), with an AUC of 0.90 (95% CI: 0.87-0.92), indicating no publication bias (p-value = 0.54 > 0.05). PET/CT radiomics showed a sensitivity of 0.82 (95% CI: 0.76-0.86, p < 0.01) and specificity of 0.86 (95% CI: 0.81-0.90, p < 0.01), with an AUC of 0.90 (95% CI: 0.87-0.93), with a slight publication bias (p-value = 0.03 < 0.05). Despite high clinical utility, subgroup analysis did not clarify heterogeneity sources, suggesting influences from possible factors like lymph node location and small subgroup sizes. Radiomics models show accuracy in predicting lung cancer lymph node metastasis, yet further validation with larger, multi-center studies is necessary.

To improve clinicians' management decisions, additional classifications into diagnostic categories might be helpful. A convenience sample of 100 pigmented/non-pigmented skin lesions was used for a cross-sectional two-level reader study including 96 dermatologists (level I: dermoscopy only; level II: clinical close-up images, dermoscopy, and textual information). Dermoscopic images were classified by a binary CNN trained to differentiate melanocytic from non-melanocytic lesions (FotoFinder Systems, Bad Birnbach, Germany). Primary endpoint was the accuracy of the CNN's classification in comparison with dermatologists reviewing level-II information. Secondary endpoints included dermatologists' accuracies according to their level of experience and the CNN's area under the curve (AUC) of receiver operating characteristics (ROC). The CNN revealed an accuracy and ROC AUC with corresponding 95 % confidence intervals (CI) of 91.0 % (83.8 % to 95.2 %) and 0.981 (0.962 to 1). In level I, dermatologists showed a mean accuracy of 83.7 % (82.5 % to 84.8 %). With level II information, the accuracy improved to 87.8 % (86.7 % to 88.9 %; p < 0.001). When comparing accuracies of CNN and dermatologists in level II, the CNN's accuracy was higher (91.0 % versus 87.8 %, p < 0.001). For experts with level II information results were on par with the CNN (91.0 % versus 90.4 %, p = 0.368). The tested CNN accurately differentiated melanocytic from non-melanocytic skin lesions and outperformed dermatologists. The CNN may support clinicians and could be used in an ensemble approach combined with other CNN models.",1756

Oncology,2024,"Theranostics integrate molecular imaging and targeted radionuclide therapy for personalised cancer therapy. Theranostic treatments have shown meaningful efficacy in randomised clinical trials and are approved for clinical use in prostate cancer and neuroendocrine tumours. Brain tumours represent an unmet clinical need and theranostics might offer effective treatment options, although specific issues need to be considered for clinical development. In this Policy Review, we discuss opportunities and challenges of developing targeted radionuclide therapies for the treatment of brain tumours including glioma, meningioma, and brain metastasis. The rational choice of molecular treatment targets is highlighted, including the potential relevance of different types of targeted radionuclide therapeutics, and the role of the blood-brain barrier and blood-tumour barrier. Furthermore, we discuss considerations for effective clinical trial design and conduct, as well as logistical and regulatory challenges for implementation of radionuclide therapies into neuro-oncological practice.

39210161,Development and validation of a prediction model for malignant sinonasal tumors based on MR radiomics and machine learning.,European radiology,2025,"This study aimed to utilize MR radiomics-based machine learning classifiers on a large-sample, multicenter dataset to develop an optimal model for predicting malignant sinonasal tumors and tumor-like lesions. This study included 1711 adult patients (875 benign and 836 malignant) with sinonasal tumors or tumor-like lesions from three institutions. Patients from institution 1 (n = 1367) constituted both the training and validation cohorts, while those from institution 2 and 3 (n = 158/186) made up the test cohorts. Manual segmentation of the region of interest of the tumor was performed on T1WI, T2WI, and contrast-enhanced T1WI (CE-T1WI). Data normalization, dimensional reductions, feature selection, and classifications were performed using ten machine-learning classifiers. Four fusion models, namely T1WI + T2WI, T1WI + CE-T1WI, T2WI + CE-T1WI, and T1WI + T2WI + CE-T1WI, were constructed using the top ten features with the highest contribution in feature selection in the optimal models of T1WI, T2WI, and CE-T1WI. The Delong test compared areas under the curve (AUC) between models. The AUCs of training/validation/test1/test2 datasets for T1WI, T2WI, and CE-T1WI were 0.900/0.842/0.872/0.839, 0.876/0.789/0.842/0.863, and 0.899/0.824/0.831/0.707, respectively. The fusion model from T1WI + T2WI + CE-T1WI had the highest AUC. The AUCs of training/validation/test1/test2 datasets were 0.947/0.849/0.871/0.887. The T1WI + T2WI + CE-T1WI model demonstrated a significantly higher AUC than the T2WI + CE-T1WI model in both cohorts (p < 0.05) and outperformed the T2WI model in test 1 (p = 0.008) and the T1WI model in test 2 (p = 0.006). This fusion model based on radiomics from T1WI + T2WI + CE-T1WI images and machine learning can improve the power in predicting malignant sinonasal tumors with high accuracy, resilience, and robustness. Our study proposes a radiomics-based machine learning fusion model from T1- and T2-weighted images and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images, which can non-invasively identify the nature of sinonasal tumors and improve the performance in predicting malignant sinonasal tumors. Differentiating benign and malignant sinonasal tumors is difficult due to similar clinical presentations. A radiomics model from T1 + T2 + contrast-enhanced T1 images can identify the nature of sinonasal tumors. This model can help distinguish benign and malignant sinonasal tumors.",2409
39210160,"MRI-based assessment of the mylohyoid muscle in oral squamous cell carcinoma, a 7-point scoring method.",European radiology,2025,"To investigate preoperative MRI evaluation of the features of the mylohyoid muscle (MM) predictive of its infiltration in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) treatment planning, defining the most appropriate sequences to study its deep extension into the floor of the mouth (FOM). We applied a 7-point score to retrospectively evaluate preoperative imaging of patients who underwent surgery for OSCC over 11 years. The results were compared with histopathological findings using Spearman's rank coefficient. Receiver operating characteristic curves were employed to assess the score's ability to predict MM infiltration, determining optimal thresholds for sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values. The Mann-Whitney U-test confirmed that infiltration judgments did not overlap around this threshold. Cohen's K statistical coefficient was used to evaluate the interobserver agreement. Fifty-two patients (mean age 66.4 ± 11.9 years, 36 men) were evaluated. Histopathological examination found MM infiltration in 21% of cases (n = 11), with 90% classified in the highest Score categories. A score > 4 proved to be the best cut-off for predicting the risk of MM infiltration, with a sensitivity of 91% (CI: 0.57-0.99), specificity 61% (CI: 0.45-0.76), PPV 38% (CI: 0.21-0.59), and NPV 96% (CI: 0.78-0.99). At the subsequent single-sequence assessment, the TSE-T2wi had the highest diagnostic accuracy, with sensitivity 90% (CI: 0.57-0.99), specificity 70% (CI: 0.53-0.82), PPV 45% (CI: 0.25-0.67), and NPV 96% (CI: 0.80-0.99). The 7-point score is a promising predictor of safe surgical margins for MM in OSCC treatment, with the particular benefit of T2-weighted sequences. Our scoring system for tumor infiltration of MM, which is easy to use even for less experienced radiologists, allows for uniformity in radiological language, thereby ensuring crucial preoperative information for the surgeon. The relationship of the MM to an oral lesion may impact surgical planning. As the score increases, there is a greater incidence of infiltration in the MM. Our score system improves radiologists' reporting for MM involvement by tumor.",2136
39198333,Comparative analysis of GPT-4-based ChatGPT's diagnostic performance with radiologists using real-world radiology reports of brain tumors.,European radiology,2025,"Large language models like GPT-4 have demonstrated potential for diagnosis in radiology. Previous studies investigating this potential primarily utilized quizzes from academic journals. This study aimed to assess the diagnostic capabilities of GPT-4-based Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer (ChatGPT) using actual clinical radiology reports of brain tumors and compare its performance with that of neuroradiologists and general radiologists. We collected brain MRI reports written in Japanese from preoperative brain tumor patients at two institutions from January 2017 to December 2021. The MRI reports were translated into English by radiologists. GPT-4 and five radiologists were presented with the same textual findings from the reports and asked to suggest differential and final diagnoses. The pathological diagnosis of the excised tumor served as the ground truth. McNemar's test and Fisher's exact test were used for statistical analysis. In a study analyzing 150 radiological reports, GPT-4 achieved a final diagnostic accuracy of 73%, while radiologists' accuracy ranged from 65 to 79%. GPT-4's final diagnostic accuracy using reports from neuroradiologists was higher at 80%, compared to 60% using those from general radiologists. In the realm of differential diagnoses, GPT-4's accuracy was 94%, while radiologists' fell between 73 and 89%. Notably, for these differential diagnoses, GPT-4's accuracy remained consistent whether reports were from neuroradiologists or general radiologists. GPT-4 exhibited good diagnostic capability, comparable to neuroradiologists in differentiating brain tumors from MRI reports. GPT-4 can be a second opinion for neuroradiologists on final diagnoses and a guidance tool for general radiologists and residents. This study evaluated GPT-4-based ChatGPT's diagnostic capabilities using real-world clinical MRI reports from brain tumor cases, revealing that its accuracy in interpreting brain tumors from MRI findings is competitive with radiologists. We investigated the diagnostic accuracy of GPT-4 using real-world clinical MRI reports of brain tumors. GPT-4 achieved final and differential diagnostic accuracy that is comparable with neuroradiologists. GPT-4 has the potential to improve the diagnostic process in clinical radiology.",2287
39191996,Predictive markers for head and neck cancer treatment response: T1rho imaging in nasopharyngeal carcinoma.,European radiology,2025,"To investigate the potential of T1rho, a new quantitative imaging sequence for cancer, for pre and early intra-treatment prediction of treatment response in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) and compare the results with those of diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI). T1rho and DWI imaging of primary NPCs were performed pre- and early intra-treatment in 41 prospectively recruited patients. The mean preT1rho, preADC, intraT1rho, intraADC, and % changes in T1rho (ΔT1rho%) and ADC (ΔADC%) were compared between residual and non-residual groups based on biopsy in all patients after chemoradiotherapy (CRT) with (n = 29) or without (n = 12) induction chemotherapy (IC), and between responders and non-responders to IC in the subgroup who received IC, using Mann-Whitney U-test. A p-value of < 0.05 indicated statistical significance. Significant early intra-treatment changes in mean T1rho (p = 0.049) and mean ADC (p < 0.01) were detected (using paired t-test), most showing a decrease in T1rho (63.4%) and an increase in ADC (95.1%). Responders to IC (n = 17), compared to non-responders (n = 12), showed higher preT1rho (64.0 ms vs 66.5 ms) and a greater decrease in ΔT1rho% (- 7.5% vs 1.3%) (p < 0.05). The non-residual group after CRT (n = 35), compared to the residual group (n = 6), showed higher intraADC (0.96 vs 1.09 × 10 Early intra-treatment changes are detectable on T1rho and show potential to predict tumour shrinkage after IC. T1rho may be complementary to DWI, which, unlike T1rho, did not predict response to IC but did predict non-residual disease after CRT. T1rho has the potential to complement DWI in the prediction of treatment response. Unlike DWI, it predicted shrinkage of the primary NPC after IC but not residual disease after CRT. Changes in T1rho were detected early during cancer treatment for NPC. Pre-treatment and early intra-treatment change in T1rho predicted response to IC, but not residual disease after CRT. T1rho can be used to complement DWI with DWI predicting residual disease after CRT.",2023
39189908,MRI Tumor Regression Response to Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy Alone without Radiation for Rectal Adenocarcinoma.,Radiology,2024,"Background Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NCT) is gaining acceptance for the management of locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) in patients without negative prognostic factors. However, the value of MRI in evaluating tumor response after NCT remains unclear. Purpose To investigate the accuracy of MRI in assessing pathologic complete response in participants with LARC who underwent surgery after NCT without radiation. Materials and Methods A retrospective imaging substudy was conducted within two consecutive prospective clinical trials: the expanded phase II trial (from December 2017 to May 2021) and the COPEC trial (comparison of tumor response to two or four cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy alone, ongoing from August 2021). All included participants received four cycles of capecitabine combined with oxaliplatin (or CAPOX) before surgery. Three radiologists who were blinded to the clinicopathologic data independently evaluated the tumor response using five methods, namely, MR tumor regression grade (MR-TRG) alone, diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) alone, DWI-modified MR-TRG (DWImodMR-TRG), MRI complete response, and radiologic neoadjuvant response score. With pathologic assessment serving as the reference standard, the positive and negative predictive values, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) were determined to evaluate the accuracy and performance of these models. The AUCs of the models were compared using the DeLong test. Results A total of 224 participants were included, comprising 119 from the expanded phase II trial (median age, 61 years [IQR, 53-67]; 89 male) and 105 from the COPEC trial (median age, 59 years [IQR, 53-67]; 65 male). MR-TRG, DWI, DWImodMR-TRG, MRI complete response, and the radiologic neoadjuvant response score were associated with pathologic complete response. DWImodMR-TRG achieved the highest AUC of 0.90 (95% CI: 0.85, 0.95), with a specificity of 89% (162 of 182) and a negative predictive value of 93% (162 of 174).

39189901,Accuracy of an Artificial Intelligence System for Interval Breast Cancer Detection at Screening Mammography.,Radiology,2024,"Background Artificial intelligence (AI) systems can be used to identify interval breast cancers, although the localizations are not always accurate. Purpose To evaluate AI localizations of interval cancers (ICs) on screening mammograms by IC category and histopathologic characteristics. Materials and Methods A screening mammography data set (median patient age, 57 years [IQR, 52-64 years]) that had been assessed by two human readers from January 2011 to December 2018 was retrospectively analyzed using a commercial AI system. The AI outputs were lesion locations (heatmaps) and the highest per-lesion risk score (range, 0-100) assigned to each case. AI heatmaps were considered false positive (FP) if they occurred on normal screening mammograms or on IC screening mammograms (ie, in patients subsequently diagnosed with IC) but outside the cancer boundary.

39186105,Prediction models for differentiating benign from malignant liver lesions based on multiparametric dual-energy non-contrast CT.,European radiology,2025,"To create prediction models (PMs) for distinguishing between benign and malignant liver lesions using quantitative data from dual-energy CT (DECT) without contrast agents. This retrospective study included patients with liver lesions who underwent DECT, including non-contrast-enhanced scans. Benign lesions included hepatic hemangioma, whereas malignant lesions included hepatocellular carcinoma, metastatic liver cancer, and intrahepatic cholangiocellular carcinoma. Patients were divided into derivation and validation groups. In the derivation group, two radiologists calculated ten multiparametric data using univariate and multivariate logistic regression to generate PMs. In the validation group, two additional radiologists measured the parameters to assess the diagnostic performance of PMs. The study included 121 consecutive patients (mean age 67.4 ± 13.8 years, 80 males), with 97 in the derivation group (25 benign and 72 malignant) and 24 in the validation group (7 benign and 17 malignant). Oversampling increased the benign lesion sample to 75, equalizing the malignant group for building PMs. All parameters were statistically significant in univariate analysis (all p < 0.05), leading to the creation of five PMs in multivariate analysis. The area under the curve for the five PMs of two observers was as follows: PM1 (slope K, blood) = 0.76, 0.74; PM2 (slope K, fat) = 0.55, 0.51; PM3 (effective-Z difference, blood) = 0.75, 0.72; PM4 (slope K, blood, fat) = 0.82, 0.78; and PM5 (slope K, effective-Z difference, blood) = 0.90, 0.87. PM5 yielded the best diagnostic performance. Multiparametric non-contrast-enhanced DECT is a highly effective method for distinguishing between liver lesions. The utilization of non-contrast-enhanced DECT is extremely useful for distinguishing between benign and malignant liver lesions. This approach enables physicians to plan better treatment strategies, alleviating concerns associated with contrast allergy, contrast-induced nephropathy, radiation exposure, and excessive medical expenses. Distinguishing benign from malignant liver lesions with non-contrast-enhanced CT would be desirable. This model, incorporating slope K, effective Z, and blood quantification, distinguished benign from malignant liver lesions. Non-contrast-enhanced DECT has benefits, particularly in patients with an iodine allergy, renal failure, or asthma.",2389

While the procedure is radical, it has shown promise in enhancing long-term survival and is now comparable in surgical mortality to elective resections for primary pelvic cancers. Imaging plays a crucial role in preoperative planning, with MRI, CT, and PET/CT being pivotal in assessing the extent of cancer and formulating a surgical roadmap. This paper presents clinical practice guidelines for imaging in the context of PE, developed jointly by ESGAR, SAR, ESUR, and the PelvEx Collaborative. These guidelines aim to standardize imaging protocols and reporting to improve the preoperative assessment and facilitate decision-making in the multidisciplinary treatment of pelvic cancers. Our recommendations underscore the importance of a multidisciplinary approach and the need for clear and precise imaging reports to optimize patient care.

39177855,"Renal tumor segmentation, visualization, and segmentation confidence using ensembles of neural networks in patients undergoing surgical resection.",European radiology,2025,"To develop an automatic segmentation model for solid renal tumors on contrast-enhanced CTs and to visualize segmentation with associated confidence to promote clinical applicability. The training dataset included solid renal tumor patients from two tertiary centers undergoing surgical resection and receiving CT in the corticomedullary or nephrogenic contrast media (CM) phase. Manual tumor segmentation was performed on all axial CT slices serving as reference standard for automatic segmentations. Independent testing was performed on the publicly available KiTS 2019 dataset. Ensembles of neural networks (ENN, DeepLabV3) were used for automatic renal tumor segmentation, and their performance was quantified with DICE score. ENN average foreground entropy measured segmentation confidence (binary: successful segmentation with DICE score > 0.8 versus inadequate segmentation ≤ 0.8). N = 639/n = 210 patients were included in the training and independent test dataset. Datasets were comparable regarding age and sex (p > 0.05), while renal tumors in the training dataset were larger and more frequently benign (p < 0.01). In the internal test dataset, the ENN model yielded a median DICE score = 0.84 (IQR: 0.62-0.97, corticomedullary) and 0.86 (IQR: 0.77-0.96, nephrogenic CM phase), and the segmentation confidence an AUC = 0.89 (sensitivity = 0.86; specificity = 0.77). In the independent test dataset, the ENN model achieved a median DICE score = 0.84 (IQR: 0.71-0.97, corticomedullary CM phase); and segmentation confidence an accuracy = 0.84 (sensitivity = 0.86 and specificity = 0.81). ENN segmentations were visualized with color-coded voxelwise tumor probabilities and thresholds superimposed on clinical CT images. ENN-based renal tumor segmentation robustly performs in external test data and might aid in renal tumor classification and treatment planning. Ensembles of neural networks (ENN) models could automatically segment renal tumors on routine CTs, enabling and standardizing downstream image analyses and treatment planning. Providing confidence measures and segmentation overlays on images can lower the threshold for clinical ENN implementation. Ensembles of neural networks (ENN) segmentation is visualized by color-coded voxelwise tumor probabilities and thresholds.

39174654,Complications of ultrasound-guided thermal ablation of thyroid nodules and associated risk factors: an experience from 9667 cases.,European radiology,2025,"To evaluate the safety of ultrasound-guided thermal ablation (UGTA) for thyroid nodules (TNs) by analysing complications and related risks. This retrospective, single-centre study reviewed patients who underwent UGTA (microwave or radiofrequency ablation) between January 2018 and March 2023. The incidence of complications was recorded and assessed during and immediately after ablation,1-3 h later, and at 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify risk factors for hoarseness and haemorrhagic complications. We reviewed 9667 cases in this study. Overall, 4494 (46.49%) cases underwent microwave ablation, while 5173 (53.51%) cases underwent radiofrequency ablation. The overall complication rate was 4.43%. The incidence of major complications was 1.94% (haemorrhage, 1.32%; hoarseness, 0.54%; and symptomatic aseptic necrosis, 0.08%). The incidence of minor complications was 2.45%. A large nodule volume, radiofrequency ablation, hyper-enhancing nodules, benign nodules, higher preoperative blood pressure, hyperthyroidism, and higher ablation power were independent risk factors for haemorrhage. Dorsal nodules and a higher ablation power were independent risk factors for hoarseness. All complications were resolved. This study suggests that UGTA is a safe treatment for TNs. Several risk factors for haemorrhage and hoarseness should be considered before performing UGTA. Different ablation modalities should be considered for patients with different conditions. Thermal ablation may be a safe treatment for eligible patients with TNs. We analysed the complications and risk factors associated with UGTA in 9667 cases. The complication rate was 4.43%; 1.94% were major complications. Risk factors of haemorrhage and hoarseness should be considered. UGTA was a safe method for the treatment of TNs.",1859
39167740,Breast Cancer Screening Interval: Effect on Rate of Late-Stage Disease at Diagnosis and Overall Survival.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,2024,"Controversy continues regarding the effect of screening mammography on breast cancer outcomes. We evaluated late-stage cancer rate and overall survival (OS) for different screening intervals using a real-world institutional research data mart. Patients having both a cancer registry record of new breast cancer diagnosis and prediagnosis screening history between 2004 and 2019 were identified from our institutional research breast data mart. Time interval between the two screening mammograms immediately preceding diagnosis and the time to cancer diagnosis were determined. Screening interval was deemed annual if ≤15 months, biennial if >15 and ≤27 months, intermittent if >27 months, and baseline if only one prediagnosis screen was known. The primary end point was late-stage cancer (TNM stage IIB or worse), and the secondary end point was OS. The association of screening interval and late-stage cancer was analyzed using multivariable logistic regression adjusting for prediagnosis characteristics. Proportional hazards regression was used for survival analysis. Potential lead time was analyzed using survival from a uniform fixed time point. In total, 8,145 patients with breast cancer had prediagnosis screening mammography in the timeframe. The percentage of late-stage cancers diagnosed increased significantly with screening interval with 9%, 14%, and 19% late stages for annual, biennial, and intermittent groups ( Annual mammographic screening was associated with lower risk of late-stage cancer and better OS across clinical and demographic subgroups. Our study suggests benefit of annual screening for women 40 years and older.",1646
39162635,Pain Experience and Image Quality with Curved versus Standard Compression for Breast Cancer Screening Mammography: A Randomized Controlled Trial.,Radiology,2024,"Background A curve-shaped compression paddle could reduce the pain experienced by some women at breast cancer screening. Purpose To compare curved and standard compression systems in terms of pain experience and image quality in mammography screening. Materials and Methods In this randomized controlled trial conducted between October 2021 and February 2022, participants screened at three screening sites in the Netherlands were randomized to either a curved-paddle or sham-paddle group. The sham paddle was a standard paddle that was presented as a new paddle. At a standard screening examination, one additional image was acquired with a curved or sham paddle. Pain was measured on a numerical rating scale (range, 0-10). Participants provided a pain score after compression with the standard and test paddles, resulting in two scores per participant. Differences in pain scores were compared between groups using analysis of covariance, adjusting for pain score after standard-paddle compression. Two radiographers and two radiologists performed unblinded paired comparisons of curved-paddle vs standard-paddle images, using standard image quality criteria (radiographers evaluated 1246 image pairs using 12 criteria; radiologists evaluated 320 image pairs using six criteria). The one-sample Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to determine if there was a significant preference for either paddle. Results In total, 2499 female participants (mean age, 61.6 years ± 7.1 [SD]) were studied; 1250 in the curved-paddle group and 1249 in the sham-paddle group. The mean pain score decreased by an additional 0.19 points in the curved-paddle group compared with the sham-paddle group (95% CI: 0.09, 0.28; ",1704

The system has both US and MRI components with separate but complementary lexicons and assessment categories to assign the risk of malignancy. US is an appropriate initial imaging modality, and O-RADS US can accurately help to characterize most adnexal lesions. MRI is a valuable adjunct imaging tool to US, and O-RADS MRI can help to both confirm a benign diagnosis and accurately stratify lesions that are at risk for malignancy. This article will review the O-RADS US and MRI systems, highlight their similarities and differences, and provide an overview of the interplay between the systems. When used together, the O-RADS US and MRI systems can help to accurately diagnose benign lesions, assess the risk of malignancy in lesions suspicious for malignancy, and triage patients for optimal management.",973
39154315,Speed and efficiency: evaluating pulmonary nodule detection with AI-enhanced 3D gradient echo imaging.,European radiology,2025,"Evaluating the diagnostic feasibility of accelerated pulmonary MR imaging for detection and characterisation of pulmonary nodules with artificial intelligence-aided compressed sensing. In this prospective trial, patients with benign and malignant lung nodules admitted between December 2021 and December 2022 underwent chest CT and pulmonary MRI. Pulmonary MRI used a respiratory-gated 3D gradient echo sequence, accelerated with a combination of parallel imaging, compressed sensing, and deep learning image reconstruction with three different acceleration factors (CS-AI-7, CS-AI-10, and CS-AI-15). Two readers evaluated image quality (5-point Likert scale), nodule detection and characterisation (size and morphology) of all sequences compared to CT in a blinded setting. Reader agreement was determined using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Thirty-seven patients with 64 pulmonary nodules (solid n = 57 [3-107 mm] part-solid n = 6 [ground glass/solid 8 mm/4-28 mm/16 mm] ground glass nodule n = 1 [20 mm]) were analysed. Nominal scan times were CS-AI-7 3:53 min; CS-AI-10 2:34 min; CS-AI-15 1:50 min. CS-AI-7 showed higher image quality, while quality remained diagnostic even for CS-AI-15. Detection rates of pulmonary nodules were 100%, 98.4%, and 96.8% for CS-AI factors 7, 10, and 15, respectively. Nodule morphology was best at the lowest acceleration and was inferior to CT in only 5% of cases, compared to 10% for CS-AI-10 and 23% for CS-AI-15. The nodule size was comparable for all sequences and deviated on average < 1 mm from the CT size. The combination of compressed sensing and AI enables a substantial reduction in the scan time of lung MRI while maintaining a high detection rate of pulmonary nodules. Incorporating compressed sensing and AI in pulmonary MRI achieves significant time savings without compromising nodule detection or characteristics. This advancement holds clinical promise, enhancing efficiency in lung cancer screening without sacrificing diagnostic quality. Lung cancer screening by MRI may be possible but would benefit from scan time optimisation. Significant scan time reduction, high detection rates, and preserved nodule characteristics were achieved across different acceleration factors. Integrating compressed sensing and AI in pulmonary MRI offers efficient lung cancer screening without compromising diagnostic quality.",2383
39150790,A validated estimate of visceral adipose tissue volume in relation to cancer risk.,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,2024,"Despite the recognized role of visceral adipose tissue in carcinogenesis, its independent association with cancer risk beyond traditional obesity measures remains unknown because of limited availability of imaging data. We developed an estimation equation for visceral adipose tissue volume using elastic net regression based on demographic and anthropometric data in a subcohort of participants in the UK Biobank (UKB; n = 23 148) with abdominal magnetic resonance imaging scans. This equation was externally validated in 2713 participants from the 2017-2018 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey according to sex, age, and race groups. We then applied the equation to the overall UKB cohort of 461 665 participants to evaluate the prospective association between estimated visceral adipose tissue and cancer risk using Cox proportional hazards models. We also calculated the population attributable risk of cancer associated with estimated visceral adipose tissue and body mass index (BMI). Estimated visceral adipose tissue showed a high correlation with measured visceral adipose tissue in internal and external validations (r = 0.81-0.86). During a median 12-year follow-up in the UKB, we documented 37 397 incident cancer cases; estimated visceral adipose tissue was statistically significantly associated with elevated risk of obesity-related and individual cancers, independent of BMI and waist circumference. Population attributable risk for total cancer associated with high (quartiles 2-4 vs 1) estimated visceral adipose tissue (9.0% for men, 11.6% for women) was higher than high BMI (quartiles 2-4 vs 1 = 5.0% for men, 8.2% for women). Estimated visceral adipose tissue showed robust performance in UKB and National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and was associated with cancer risk independent of BMI and waist circumference. This study provides a potential clinical tool for visceral adipose tissue estimation and underscores that visceral adipose tissue can be an important target for cancer prevention.",2040
39150564,Remote Neuroinflammation in Newly Diagnosed Glioblastoma Correlates with Unfavorable Clinical Outcome.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,2024,"Current therapy strategies still provide only limited success in the treatment of glioblastoma, the most frequent primary brain tumor in adults. In addition to the characterization of the tumor microenvironment, global changes in the brain of patients with glioblastoma have been described. However, the impact and molecular signature of neuroinflammation distant of the primary tumor site have not yet been thoroughly elucidated. We performed translocator protein (TSPO)-PET in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma (n = 41), astrocytoma WHO grade 2 (n = 7), and healthy controls (n = 20) and compared TSPO-PET signals of the non-lesion (i.e., contralateral) hemisphere. Back-translation into syngeneic SB28 glioblastoma mice was used to characterize Pet alterations on a cellular level. Ultimately, multiplex gene expression analyses served to profile immune cells in remote brain. Our study revealed elevated TSPO-PET signals in contralateral hemispheres of patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma compared to healthy controls. Contralateral TSPO was associated with persisting epileptic seizures and shorter overall survival independent of the tumor phenotype. Back-translation into syngeneic glioblastoma mice pinpointed myeloid cells as the predominant source of contralateral TSPO-PET signal increases and identified a complex immune signature characterized by myeloid cell activation and immunosuppression in distant brain regions. Neuroinflammation within the contralateral hemisphere can be detected with TSPO-PET imaging and associates with poor outcome in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma. The molecular signature of remote neuroinflammation promotes the evaluation of immunomodulatory strategies in patients with detrimental whole brain inflammation as reflected by high TSPO expression.",1818

39143249,Are there features that can predict the unresectability of pleural mesothelioma?,European radiology,2025,"The current clinical staging of pleural mesothelioma (PM) is often discordant with the pathologic staging. This study aimed to identify clinical and radiological features that could help predict unresectability in PM. Twenty-two descriptive radiologic features were retrospectively evaluated on preoperative computed tomography (CT) and/or positron emission tomography/CT (PET/CT) performed in patients with presumably resectable PM who underwent surgery. Measurements of maximum and sum pleural thickness at three levels of the thorax (upper, middle, and lower) were taken and stratified based on the cutpoints provided by the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC). Clinical and radiological features, including clinical-stage, were compared between resectable and unresectable tumors by univariate analysis and logistic regression modeling. Of 133 patients, 69/133 (52%) had resectable and 64/133 (48%) had unresectable PM. Asbestos exposure (p = 0.005), neoadjuvant treatment (p = 0.001), clinical T-stage (p < 0.0001), all pleural thickness measurements (p < 0.05), pleural thickness pattern (p < 0.0001) and degree (p = 0.033), lung invasion (p = 0.004), extrapleural space obliteration (p < 0.0001), extension to subphrenic space (p = 0.0004), and two combination variables representing extensive diaphragmatic contact and/or chest wall involvement (p = 0.002) and mediastinal invasion (p < 0.0001) were significant predictors at univariate analysis. At multivariable analysis, all models achieved a strong diagnostic performance (area under the curve (AUC) > 0.8). The two best-performing models were one that included the upper-level maximum pleural thickness, extrapleural space obliteration, and mediastinal infiltration (AUC = 0.876), and another that integrated clinical variables and radiological assessment through the clinical T-stage (AUC = 0.879). Selected clinical and radiologic features, including pleural thickness measurements, appear to be strong predictors of unresectability in PM. A more accurate prediction of unresectability in the preoperative assessment of patients with pleural mesothelioma may avoid unnecessary surgery and prompt initiation of nonsurgical treatments. About half of pleural mesothelioma patients are reported to receive an incorrect disease stage preoperatively. Eleven features identified as predictors of unresectability were included in strongly performing predictive models. More accurate preoperative staging will help clinicians and patients choose the most appropriate treatments.",2561
39143248,"Pathological prognostic factors of rectal cancer based on diffusion-weighted imaging, intravoxel incoherent motion, and diffusion kurtosis imaging.",European radiology,2025,"To explore diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM), and diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) for assessing pathological prognostic factors in patients with rectal cancer. A total of 162 patients (105 males; mean age of 61.8 ± 13.1 years old) scheduled to undergo radical surgery were enrolled in this prospective study. The pathological prognostic factors included histological differentiation, lymph node metastasis (LNM), and extramural vascular invasion (EMVI). The DWI, IVIM, and DKI parameters were obtained and correlated with prognostic factors using univariable and multivariable logistic regression. Their assessment value was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Multivariable logistic regression analyses showed that higher mean kurtosis (MK) (odds ratio (OR) = 194.931, p < 0.001) and lower apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) (OR = 0.077, p = 0.025) were independently associated with poorer differentiation tumors. Higher perfusion fraction (f) (OR = 575.707, p = 0.023) and higher MK (OR = 173.559, p < 0.001) were independently associated with LNMs. Higher f (OR = 1036.116, p = 0.024), higher MK (OR = 253.629, p < 0.001), lower mean diffusivity (MD) (OR = 0.125, p = 0.038), and lower ADC (OR = 0.094, p = 0.022) were independently associated with EMVI. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) of MK for histological differentiation was significantly higher than ADC (0.771 vs. 0.638, p = 0.035). The AUC of MK for LNM positivity was higher than f (0.770 vs. 0.656, p = 0.048). The AUC of MK combined with MD (0.790) was the highest among f (0.663), MK (0.779), MD (0.617), and ADC (0.610) in assessing EMVI. The DKI parameters may be used as imaging biomarkers to assess pathological prognostic factors of rectal cancer before surgery. Diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) parameters, particularly mean kurtosis (MK), are promising biomarkers for assessing histological differentiation, lymph node metastasis, and extramural vascular invasion of rectal cancer. These findings suggest DKI's potential in the preoperative assessment of rectal cancer. Mean kurtosis outperformed the apparent diffusion coefficient in assessing histological differentiation in resectable rectal cancer. Perfusion fraction and mean kurtosis are independent indicators for assessing lymph node metastasis in rectal cancer. Mean kurtosis and mean diffusivity demonstrated superior accuracy in assessing extramural vascular invasion.",2480
39143247,Patient perspectives on the use of artificial intelligence in prostate cancer diagnosis on MRI.,European radiology,2025,"This study investigated patients' acceptance of artificial intelligence (AI) for diagnosing prostate cancer (PCa) on MRI scans and the factors influencing their trust in AI diagnoses. A prospective, multicenter study was conducted between January and November 2023. Patients undergoing prostate MRI were surveyed about their opinions on hypothetical AI assessment of their MRI scans. The questionnaire included nine items: four on hypothetical scenarios of combinations between AI and the radiologist, two on trust in the diagnosis, and three on accountability for misdiagnosis. Relationships between the items and independent variables were assessed using multivariate analysis. A total of 212 PCa suspicious patients undergoing prostate MRI were included. The majority preferred AI involvement in their PCa diagnosis alongside a radiologist, with 91% agreeing with AI as the primary reader and 79% as the secondary reader. If AI has a high certainty diagnosis, 15% of the respondents would accept it as the sole decision-maker. Autonomous AI outperforming radiologists would be accepted by 52%. Higher educated persons tended to accept AI when it would outperform radiologists (p < 0.05). The respondents indicated that the hospital (76%), radiologist (70%), and program developer (55%) should be held accountable for misdiagnosis. Patients favor AI involvement alongside radiologists in PCa diagnosis. Trust in AI diagnosis depends on the patient's education level and the AI performance, with autonomous AI acceptance by a small majority on the condition that AI outperforms a radiologist. Respondents held the hospital, radiologist, and program developers accountable for misdiagnosis in descending order of accountability. Patients show a high level of acceptance for AI-assisted prostate cancer diagnosis on MRI, either alongside radiologists or fully autonomous, particularly if it demonstrates superior performance to radiologists alone. Prostate cancer suspicious patients may accept autonomous AI based on performance. Patients prefer AI involvement alongside a radiologist in diagnosing prostate cancer. Patients indicate accountability for AI should be shared among multiple stakeholders.",2201
39143246,Contrast-enhanced US versus US-guided biopsy for abdominal and pelvic neoplasm in paediatric patients: a propensity score matching study.,European radiology,2025,"To compare the diagnostic performance of CEUS-guided biopsy (CEUS-GB) and ultrasound-guided biopsy (US-GB) in evaluating abdominal and pelvic (abdominopelvic) neoplasms in paediatric patients. Patients aged < 18 years with abdominopelvic tumours who underwent either CEUS-GB or US-GB between April 2005 and May 2022 were retrospectively evaluated. Tumours diagnosed as malignancies by pathology were considered true-positive findings. Benign lesions were identified by pathology or clinical follow-up of at least 6 months. The diagnostic performance of the two groups was compared using propensity score matching (PSM). Complications were also analysed. The present study included 764 paediatric patients (437 boys; median age, 24 months; interquartile range, 10-60 months); 151 were in the CEUS-GB group, and 613 were in the US-GB group. The sample adequacy rate was 100% (151 of 151) for the CEUS-GB group, which was greater than the 97.4% (597 of 613) for the US-GB group (p < 0.001). The overall diagnostic accuracy of the CEUS-GB group and US-GB group was 98.7% (149 of 151) versus 97.3% (581 of 597) in the total cohort (p = 0.551) and 98.7% (149 of 151) versus 92.7% (140 of 151) in the PSM cohort (p = 0.020). Two patients (0.3%) in the US-GB group experienced complications (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), grade 1-2) correlated with the biopsy. No adverse reactions occurred in the CEUS-GB group. CEUS-GB of abdominopelvic tumours in paediatric patients is an effective and safe procedure with greater diagnostic accuracy than US-GB, especially for tumours with necrotic areas. Contrast-enhanced US-guided biopsy of solid abdominal and pelvic tumours in paediatric patients is an effective and safe procedure with greater diagnostic accuracy than US-guided biopsy, especially for tumours with necrotic areas. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) may be superior to conventional ultrasound at guiding biopsy of abdominopelvic masses in paediatric patients. CEUS-guided core needle biopsy of abdominopelvic masses in children was safe and resulted in a diagnostic yield of 98.7%. CEUS guidance should be considered in this population when colour Doppler US is unable to determine a biopsy site.",2225
39143245,Breast radiation dose with contrast-enhanced mammography-guided biopsy: a retrospective comparison with stereotactic and tomosynthesis guidance.,European radiology,2025,"This retrospective study aimed to compare the average glandular dose (AGD) per acquisition in breast biopsies guided by contrast-enhanced mammography (CEM), conventional stereotactic breast biopsy (SBB), and digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT). The study also investigated the influence of compressed breast thickness (CBT) and density on AGD. Furthermore, the study aimed to estimate the AGD per procedure for each guidance modality. The study included 163 female patients (mean age 57 ± 10 years) who underwent mammography-guided biopsies using SBB (9%), DBT (65%), or CEM (26%) guidance. AGD and CBT data were extracted from DICOM headers, and breast density was visually assessed. Statistical analyses included two-sample t-tests and descriptive statistics. Mean AGD per acquisition varied slightly among CEM (1.48 ± 0.22 mGy), SBB (1.49 ± 0.40 mGy), and DBT (1.55 ± 0.47 mGy), with CEM presenting higher AGD at lower CBTs and less dose escalation at higher CBTs. For CBT > 55 mm, CEM showed reduced AGD compared to SBB and DBT (p < 0.001). Breast density had minimal impact on AGD, except for category A. The estimated AGD per procedure was approximately 11.84 mGy for CEM, 11.92 mGy for SBB, and 6.2 mGy for DBT. The study found mean AGD per acquisition to be similar for CEM and SBB, with DBT slightly higher. CEM demonstrated higher AGD at lower CBT but lower AGD at higher CBT, indicating reduced dose escalation with increasing thickness. While breast density had minimal overall impact, variations were noted in category A. DBT was more dose-efficient per procedure due to fewer acquisitions required. CEM guidance provides effective lesion visualization within safe radiation limits, improving the precision of percutaneous image-guided breast interventions and supporting its potential consideration in a wider range of breast diagnostic procedures. Limited data exist on the AGD using CEM guidance for breast biopsies. CEM and SBB exhibit similar AGD per acquisition; DBT demonstrated the lowest AGD per procedure. Radiation from CEM guidance fits within safe limits for percutaneous image-guided breast interventions.",2131
39142654,"Oxygen-Enhanced MRI Detects Incidence, Onset, and Heterogeneity of Radiation-Induced Hypoxia Modification in HPV-Associated Oropharyngeal Cancer.",Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,2024,"Hypoxia mediates treatment resistance in solid tumors. We evaluated if oxygen-enhanced MRI-derived hypoxic volume (HVMRI) is repeatable and can detect radiotherapy-induced hypoxia modification in human papillomavirus-associated oropharyngeal head and neck squamous cell cancer. A total of 27 patients were recruited prospectively between March 2021 and January 2024. HVMRI was measured in primary and nodal tumors prior to standard-of-care (chemo)radiotherapy and then at weeks 2 and 4 (W2 and W4) into therapy. Two pretreatment scans assessed biomarker within-subject coefficient of variation and repeatability coefficient (RC). Cohort treatment response was measured using mixed-effects modeling. Responding lesions were identified by comparing HVMRI change with RC limits of agreement. Oxygen-enhanced MRI identified hypoxia in all lesions. The HVMRI within-subject coefficient of variation was 24.6%, and RC limits of agreement were -45.7% to 84.1%. A cohort median pretreatment HVMRI of 11.3 cm3 reduced to 6.9 cm3 at W2 and 5.9 cm3 at W4 (both P < 0.001). HVMRI was reduced in 54.5% of individual lesions by W2 and in 88.2% by W4. All lesions with W2 hypoxia reduction showed persistent modification at W4. HVMRI reduced in some lesions that showed no overall volume change. Hypoxia modification was discordant between primary and nodal tumors in 50.0% of patients. Radiation-induced hypoxia modification can occur as early as W2, but onset varies between patients and was not necessarily associated with overall size change. Half of all patients had discordant changes in primary and nodal tumors. These findings have implications for patient selection and timing of dose de-escalation strategies in human papillomavirus-associated oropharyngeal carcinoma.

39136705,ESR Essentials: response assessment criteria in oncologic imaging-practice recommendations by the European Society of Oncologic Imaging.,European radiology,2025,"Assessing the response to oncological treatments is paramount for determining the prognosis and defining the best treatment for each patient. Several biomarkers, including imaging, can be used, but standardization is fundamental for consistency and reliability. Tumor response evaluation criteria have been defined by international groups for application in pharmaceutical clinical trials evaluating new drugs or therapeutic strategies. RECIST 1.1 criteria are exclusively based on unidimensional lesion measurements; changes in tumor size are used as surrogate imaging biomarkers to correlate with patient outcomes. However, increased tumor size does not always reflect tumor progression. The introduction of immunotherapy has led to the development of new criteria (iRECIST, Level of Evidence (LoE) Ib) that consider the possibility that an increase in disease burden is secondary to the immune response instead of progression, with the new concept of Unconfirmed Progressive Disease (a first progression event which must be confirmed on follow-up). Specific criteria were devised for HCC (mRECIST, LoE IV), which measure only enhancing HCC portions to account for changes after local therapy. For GIST treated with imatinib, criteria were developed to account for the possible increase in size reflecting a response rather than a progression by assessing both tumor size and density on CT (Choi, LoE II). This article provides concise and relevant practice recommendations aimed at general radiologists to help choose and apply the most appropriate criteria for assessing response to treatment in different oncologic scenarios. Though these criteria were developed for clinical trials, they may be applied in clinical practice as a guide for day-to-day interpretation. KEY POINTS: Response evaluation criteria, designed for use in clinical trials, might serve as a surrogate biomarker for overall survival. RECIST 1.1 defines measurable and non-measurable disease among which target lesions and non-target lesions are selected at baseline as reference for follow-ups. Some therapies and/or cancers require the use of different criteria, such as iRECIST, mRECIST, and Choi criteria.",2184
39136568,Arterial Mucosal Linear Enhancement at Contrast-enhanced MRI to Exclude Residual Tumor after Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy and Radiation Therapy for Rectal Cancer.,Radiology,2024,"Background A watch-and-wait regimen for locally advanced rectal cancer after neoadjuvant chemotherapy and radiation therapy (NCRT) relies on identifying complete tumor response. However, the concordance between a complete response at combined T2-weighted and diffusion-weighted MRI (T2DWI) and pathologic complete response (pCR; ie, ypT0N0) in the tumor is unsatisfactory. Purpose To assess whether identification of mucosal linear enhancement (MLE) at arterial-phase contrast-enhanced (CE) T1-weighted MRI is associated with ypT0 status in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer after NCRT and to evaluate whether combining MLE at CE T1-weighted MRI and negative lymph node metastasis (LNM) at T2DWI can improve identification of pCR. Materials and Methods This retrospective study included patients with locally advanced rectal cancer who underwent total mesorectal excision after NCRT between July 2020 and July 2023 at a tertiary referral academic center. Restaging MRI included T2DWI and arterial-phase CE T1-weighted MRI for primary tumor assessment and T2DWI for evaluation of LNM status. Imaging features associated with ypT0 status were identified at multivariable regression analysis. Results In total, 239 patients (mean age, 58 years ± 12 [SD]; 180 male patients) were assessed. MLE was more common in the ypT0 group than in the ypT1-4 group after NCRT (73% vs 4%, respectively; ",1397

39136561,Update on PI-RADS Version 2.1 Diagnostic Performance Benchmarks for Prostate MRI: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,Radiology,2024,"Background Prostate MRI for the detection of clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa) is standardized by the Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS), currently in version 2.1. A systematic review and meta-analysis infrastructure with a 12-month update cycle was established to evaluate the diagnostic performance of PI-RADS over time. Purpose To provide estimates of diagnostic accuracy and cancer detection rates (CDRs) of PI-RADS version 2.1 categories for prostate MRI, which is required for further evidence-based patient management. Materials and Methods A systematic search of PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and multiple trial registers (English-language studies published from March 1, 2019, to August 30, 2022) was performed. Studies that reported data on diagnostic accuracy or CDRs of PI-RADS version 2.1 with csPCa as the primary outcome were included. For the meta-analysis, pooled estimates for sensitivity, specificity, and CDRs were derived from extracted data at the lesion level and patient level. Sensitivity and specificity for PI-RADS greater than or equal to 3 and PI-RADS greater than or equal to 4 considered as test positive were investigated. In addition to individual PI-RADS categories 1-5, subgroup analyses of subcategories (ie, 2+1, 3+0) were performed. Results A total of 70 studies (11 686 lesions, 13 330 patients) were included. At the patient level, with PI-RADS greater than or equal to 3 considered positive, meta-analysis found a 96% summary sensitivity (95% CI: 95, 98) and 43% specificity (95% CI: 33, 54), with an area under the summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC) curve of 0.86 (95% CI: 0.75, 0.93). For PI-RADS greater than or equal to 4, meta-analysis found an 89% sensitivity (95% CI: 85, 92) and 66% specificity (95% CI: 58, 74), with an area under the SROC curve of 0.89 (95% CI: 0.85, 0.92). CDRs were as follows: PI-RADS 1, 6%; PI-RADS 2, 5%; PI-RADS 3, 19%; PI-RADS 4, 54%; and PI-RADS 5, 84%.

39134745,Simulation training in mammography with AI-generated images: a multireader study.,European radiology,2025,"The interpretation of mammograms requires many years of training and experience. Currently, training in mammography, like the rest of diagnostic radiology, is through institutional libraries, books, and experience accumulated over time. We explore whether artificial Intelligence (AI)-generated images can help in simulation education and result in measurable improvement in performance of residents in training. We developed a generative adversarial network (GAN) that was capable of generating mammography images with varying characteristics, such as size and density, and created a tool with which a user could control these characteristics. The tool allowed the user (a radiology resident) to realistically insert cancers within different regions of the mammogram. We then provided this tool to residents in training. Residents were randomized into a practice group and a non-practice group, and the difference in performance before and after practice with such a tool (in comparison to no intervention in the non-practice group) was assessed. Fifty residents participated in the study, 27 underwent simulation training, and 23 did not. There was a significant improvement in the sensitivity (7.43 percent, significant at p-value = 0.03), negative predictive value (5.05 percent, significant at p-value = 0.008) and accuracy (6.49 percent, significant at p-value = 0.01) among residents in the detection of cancer on mammograms after simulation training. Our study shows the value of simulation training in diagnostic radiology and explores the potential of generative AI to enable such simulation training. Using generative artificial intelligence, simulation training modules can be developed that can help residents in training by providing them with a visual impression of a variety of different cases. Generative networks can produce diagnostic imaging with specific characteristics, potentially useful for training residents. Training with generating images improved residents' mammographic diagnostic abilities. Development of a game-like interface that exploits these networks can result in improvement in performance over a short training period.",2159
39134744,Performance of amide proton transfer imaging to differentiate true progression from therapy-related changes in gliomas and metastases.,European radiology,2025,"Differentiating true progression or recurrence (TP/TR) from therapy-related changes (TRC) is complex in brain tumours. Amide proton transfer-weighted (APT) imaging is a chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) MRI technique that may improve diagnostic accuracy during radiological follow-up. This systematic review and meta-analysis elucidated the level of evidence and details of state-of-the-art imaging for APT-CEST in glioma and brain metastasis surveillance. PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library were systematically searched for original articles about glioma and metastasis patients who received APT-CEST imaging for suspected TP/TR within 2 years after (chemo)radiotherapy completion. Modified Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 criteria were applied. A meta-analysis was performed to pool results and to compare subgroups. Fifteen studies were included for a narrative synthesis, twelve of which (500 patients) were deemed sufficiently homogeneous for a meta-analysis. Magnetisation transfer ratio asymmetry performed well in gliomas (sensitivity 0.88 [0.82-0.92], specificity 0.84 [0.72-0.91]) but not in metastases (sensitivity 0.64 [0.38-0.84], specificity 0.56 [0.33-0.77]). APT-CEST combined with conventional/advanced MRI rendered 0.92 [0.86-0.96] and 0.88 [0.72-0.95] in gliomas. Tumour type, TR prevalence, sex, and acquisition protocol were sources of significant inter-study heterogeneity in sensitivity (I A growing body of literature suggests that APT-CEST is a promising technique for improving the discrimination of TP/TR from TRC in gliomas, with limited data on metastases. This meta-analysis identified a utility for APT-CEST imaging regarding the non-invasive discrimination of brain tumour progression from therapy-related changes, providing a critical evaluation of sequence parameters and cut-off values, which can be used to improve response assessment and patient outcome. Therapy-related changes mimicking progression complicate brain tumour treatment. Amide proton imaging improves the non-invasive discrimination of glioma progression from therapy-related changes. Magnetisation transfer ratio asymmetry measurement seems not to have added value in brain metastases.",2237

Uptake of breast cancer screening and early-detection practices in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) has not been synthesized. We aimed to systematically quantify uptake of breast cancer screening in LMIC. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational population-based studies that reported the uptake of screening or early-detection practices. We searched the PubMed, Scopus, Embase, and Web of Knowledge databases to January 2024. We pooled data using random-effects meta-analysis and explored heterogeneity using subgroup analyses. We included 174 population-based studies encompassing more than 78 million women. Pooled prevalence of self-reported uptake of screening mammography was 22.7% (95% confidence interval = 18.6% to 27.2%), of self-reports of having had a clinical breast examination for screening was 23.1% (95% confidence interval = 19.5% to 27.0%), and of self-reported regular breast self-examination (relevant for breast awareness in LMIC) was 14.6% (95% confidence interval = 11.6% to 17.9%). Uptake of breast cancer screening practices was lowest in Africa and low- and lower-middle income countries. Uptake of breast cancer screening practices remained stable over time or decreased slightly. Women who lived in rural area, were single, had lower income levels, had low educational attainment, were unemployed, were uninsured, and had no family history of breast cancer were generally least likely to self-report uptake of breast cancer screening. This meta-analysis identified concerningly low uptake of breast cancer screening practices in LMIC.

This prospective study ran from January 2022 to September 2023 and consecutively enrolled participants with RA who underwent pre-operative MRI and radical surgery. The APTw signal intensity (SI) values of RA with various tumor (T), node (N) stages, perineural invasion (PNI), and tumor grade were compared by Mann-Whitney U-test or t-test. The receiver operating characteristic curve was used to evaluate the diagnostic performance of the APTw SI values. A total of 51 participants were enrolled (mean age, 58 years ± 10 [standard deviation], 26 men). There were 24 in the T1-T2 stage and 9 with positive PNI. The APTw SI max, 99th, and 95th values were significantly higher in T3-T4 stage tumor than in T1-T2; the median (interquartile range) (M (IQR)) was (4.0% (3.6-4.9%) vs 3.4% (2.9- 4.3%), p = 0.017), (3.7% (3.2-4.1%) vs 3.2% (2.8-3.8%), p = 0.013), and (3.3% (2.8-3.8%) vs 2.9% (2.3-3.5%), p = 0.033), respectively.

39120792,Performance of grayscale combined with contrast-enhanced ultrasound in differentiating benign and malignant pediatric ovarian masses.,European radiology,2025,"To evaluate grayscale US combined with contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) in the preoperative differentiation between benign and malignant ovarian masses in a pediatric population. This retrospective study enrolled patients who underwent grayscale US and CEUS before surgery because of ovarian masses between July 2018 and September 2023, with available histopathologic or follow-up results. Two senior radiologists summarized the grayscale US and CEUS characteristics of all ovarian masses, including percentage of solidity, ascites, vascularity, and enhanced vessel morphology. These characteristics were then independently reviewed by radiologists with different experience to assess interobserver agreement. Diagnostic performance was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), while interobserver agreement was evaluated by intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). A total of 26 children (median age: 10.1 [7.5, 11.7] years; age range: 0-14 years; benign: 15 patients) were included. The main characteristics of malignant ovarian tumors were abundant blood flow and twisted blood vessels within the mass, enhanced portion of the mass over 50 percent (all p < 0.001). The grayscale US combined with CEUS showed better diagnostic performance than the grayscale US alone (AUC = 0.99 [95% CI: 0.95, 1.00] vs AUC = 0.70 [95% CI: 0.50, 0.90] p < 0.001). A statistically significant AUC before and after CEUS was also shown between two junior radiologists (0.75 vs 0.92 and 0.69 vs 0.86, respectively, both p < 0.05). ICC of CEUS was better than that of grayscale US among radiologists. The combination of grayscale US and CEUS might improve the diagnostic accuracy in differentiating benign and malignant pediatric ovarian masses. Grayscale ultrasound combined with contrast-enhanced ultrasound can improve the diagnostic performance in the preoperative differentiation of benign and malignant ovarian lesions in a pediatric population. Correctly distinguishing benign from malignant ovarian masses in pediatric patients is critical for determining treatments. Grayscale combined with contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) differentiated benign and malignant pediatric ovarian masses better than grayscale US alone. Junior radiologists' diagnostic performances could be and were significantly improved with the application of CEUS.",2369
39115585,Direct correlation of MR-DWI and histopathology of Wilms' tumours through a patient-specific 3D-printed cutting guide.,European radiology,2025,"The International Society of Paediatric Oncology-Renal Tumour Study Group (SIOP-RTSG) discourages invasive procedures to determine the histology of paediatric renal neoplasms at diagnosis. Therefore, the histological subtype of Wilms' tumours (WT) is unknown at the start of neoadjuvant chemotherapy. MR-DWI shows potential value as a non-invasive biomarker through apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs). This study aimed to describe MR characteristics and ADC values of paediatric renal tumours to differentiate subtypes. Children with a renal tumour undergoing surgery within the SIOP-RTSG 2016-UMBRELLA protocol were prospectively included between May 2021 and 2023. In the case of a total nephrectomy, a patient-specific cutting guide based on the neoadjuvant MR was 3D-printed, allowing a correlation between imaging and histopathology. Whole-tumour volumes and ADC values were statistically compared with the Mann-Whitney U-test. Direct correlation on the microscopic slide level was analysed through mixed model analysis. Fifty-nine lesions of 54 patients (58% male, median age 3.0 years (range 0-17.7 years)) were included. Forty-four lesions involved a WT. Stromal type WT showed the lowest median decrease in volume after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (48.1 cm Correlation between histopathology and MR-DWI through a patient-specific 3D-printed cutting guide resulted in significant discrimination of stromal type WT from epithelial and blastemal subtypes. Stromal Wilms' tumours could be discriminated from epithelial- and blastemal lesions based on high apparent diffusion coefficient values and limited decrease in volume after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. This may aid in future decision-making, especially concerning discrimination between low- and high-risk neoplasms. MR-DWI shows potential value as a non-invasive biomarker in paediatric renal tumours. The patient-specific cutting guide leads to a correlation between apparent diffusion coefficient values and Wilms' tumour subtype. Stromal areas could be discriminated from epithelial and blastemal foci in Wilms' tumours based on apparent diffusion coefficient values.",2132
39112752,An imaging-based model to predict the malignant potential of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm of the pancreas.,European radiology,2025,"To develop and validate imaging-based models for predicting the malignancy risk of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN). We retrospectively analyzed data from 241 IPMN patients who underwent preoperative CT and MRI for model development. Cyst size, presence and size of the enhancing mural nodule (EMN), main pancreatic duct (MPD) diameter, thickened/enhancing cyst wall, abrupt MPD caliber change with distal atrophy, and lymphadenopathy were assessed. Multiple logistic regression models predicting malignancy risk were created using either continuous (Model C) or dichotomized variables (Model D) using these imaging features. Validation included internal (n = 55) and external (n = 43) datasets. Model performance was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and compared with that of the international guideline-based model (Model F). Model C identified age, EMN size, MPD diameter, and lymphadenopathy as independent predictors on CT, and age and presence and size of EMN on MRI. Model D identified age ≥ 68, cyst size ≥ 31 mm, EMN ≥ 6 mm, MPD ≥ 7 mm, and lymphadenopathy as independent predictors on CT, and age ≥ 68, EMN ≥ 4.5 mm, and lymphadenopathy on MRI. Model C (AUC, 0.763-0.899) performed slightly better than Model D (AUC, 0.753-0.912) without statistical significance. No significant difference was observed between Models C and F (AUC, 0.729-0.952). Combining Model C with obstructive jaundice improved performance (AUC, 0.802-0.941) without statistical significance. Our imaging-based models effectively predicted the malignancy risk of IPMNs, comparable to international consensus guidelines. Imaging features are important for predicting the malignant potential of IPMNs. Our imaging-based model may help determine surgical candidacy for patients with IPMNs. Non-invasively determining the malignant potential of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) allows for appropriate treatment decision-making We identified multiple imaging features that are associated with malignant transformation and developed models for this prediction. Our model performs comparably with international consensus guidelines in predicting the malignant potential of IPMNs.",2230
39111206,"Integrated nomogram to predict HER2 expression in breast tumor: Clinical, Ultrasound, and Photoacoustic imaging approaches.","European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",2024,"HER2 is a key biomarker for breast cancer treatment and prognosis. Traditional assessment methods like immunohistochemistry (IHC) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) are effective but costly and time-consuming. Our model incorporates these methods alongside photoacoustic imaging to enhance diagnostic accuracy and provide more comprehensive clinical insights. A total of 301 breast tumors were included in this study, divided into HER2-positive (3+ or 2+ with gene amplification) and HER2-negative (below 3+ and 2+ without gene amplification) groups. Samples were split into training and validation sets in a 7:3 ratio. Statistical analyses involved t-tests, chi-square tests, and rank-sum tests. Predictive factors were identified using univariate and multivariate logistic regression, leading to the creation of three models: ModA (clinical factors only), ModB (clinical plus ultrasound factors), and ModC (clinical, ultrasound, and photoacoustic imaging-derived oxygen saturation (SO2)). The area under the curve (AUC) for ModA was 0.756 (95 % CI: 0.69-0.82), ModB increased to 0.866 (95 % CI: 0.82-0.91), and ModC showed the highest performance with an AUC of 0.877 (95 % CI: 0.83-0.92). These results indicate that the comprehensive model combining clinical, ultrasound, and photoacoustic imaging data (ModC) performed best in predicting HER2 expression. The findings suggest that integrating clinical, ultrasound, and photoacoustic imaging data significantly enhances the accuracy of predicting HER2 expression. For personalised breast cancer treatment, the integrated model could provide a comprehensive and reproducible decision support tool.",1661
39110181,"Fat-signal suppression in breast diffusion-weighted imaging: the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly.",European radiology,2025,"Fat-signal suppression is essential for breast diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (or diffusion-weighted MRI, DWI) as the very low diffusion coefficient of fat tends to decrease absolute diffusion coefficient (ADC) values. Among several methods, the STIR (short-tau inversion recovery) method is a popular approach, but signal suppression/attenuation is not specific to fat contrary to other methods such as SPAIR (spectral adiabatic (or attenuated) inversion recovery). This article focuses on those two techniques to illustrate the importance of appropriate fat suppression in breast DWI, briefly presenting the pros and cons of both approaches. We show here through simulation and data acquired in a dedicated breast DWI phantom made of vials with water and various concentrations of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) how ADC values obtained with STIR DWI may be biased toward tissue components with the longest T1 values: ADC values obtained with STIR fat suppression may be over/underestimated depending on the T1 and ADC profile within tissues. This bias is also illustrated in two clinical examples. Fat-specific methods should be preferred over STIR for fat-signal suppression in breast DWI, such as SPAIR which also provides a higher sensitivity than STIR for lesion detection. One should remain aware, however, that efficient fat-signal suppression with SPAIR requires good B0 shimming to avoid ADC underestimation from residual fat contamination. The spectral adiabatic (or attenuated) inversion recovery (SPAIR) method should be preferred over short-tau inversion recovery (STIR) for fat suppression in breast DWI. Fat-signal suppression is essential for breast DWI; the SPAIR method is recommended. Short-tau inversion recovery (STIR) is not specific to fat; as a result, SNR is decreased and ADC values may be over- or underestimated. The STIR fat-suppression method must not be used after the injection of gadolinium-based contrast agents.",1949

In contrast, deep learning (DL) produces deterministic outputs. Purpose To develop a DL model to predict the presence of csPCa by using patient-level labels without information about tumor location and to compare its performance with that of radiologists. Materials and Methods Data from patients without known csPCa who underwent MRI from January 2017 to December 2019 at one of multiple sites of a single academic institution were retrospectively reviewed. A convolutional neural network was trained to predict csPCa from T2-weighted images, diffusion-weighted images, apparent diffusion coefficient maps, and T1-weighted contrast-enhanced images. The reference standard was pathologic diagnosis. Radiologist performance was evaluated as follows: Radiology reports were used for the internal test set, and four radiologists' PI-RADS ratings were used for the external (ProstateX) test set. The performance was compared using areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) and the DeLong test. Gradient-weighted class activation maps (Grad-CAMs) were used to show tumor localization. Results Among 5735 examinations in 5215 patients (mean age, 66 years ± 8 [SD]; all male), 1514 examinations (1454 patients) showed csPCa.

This multicenter retrospective study included patients who underwent CT-guided radiofrequency or microwave ablation for CRLM between 2009 and 2021 in three institutions. Three-dimensional (3D) MAM was retrospectively assessed using dedicated ablation confirmation software by automatic non-rigid (Ablation-fit) or semi-automatic rigid co-registration (SAFIR) of intraprocedural pre- and post-ablation contrast-enhanced CT scans by two independent reader teams blinded to patient outcomes. LTP was assessed on a per-tumor basis. Factors associated with LTP-free survival were assessed using multivariable Cox regression analysis. Overall, 113 patients (mean age: 67 ± 10 years; 78 men) who underwent thermal ablation for 189 CRLM (mean diameter: 1.9 ± 1.1 cm) met the inclusion criteria. 173/189 (92%) CRLM could be successfully analyzed using both software. Over a median follow-up of 31 months (IQR: 22-47), 21 of 173 CRLM (12.1%) developed LTP. On multivariable analysis, 3D MAM was independently associated with LTP in both software (Ablation-fit: HR 0.47, 95% CI: 0.36-0.61, p < 0.001; SAFIR: HR 0.42, 95% CI: 0.32-0.55, p < 0.001). No LTP was observed in CRLM ablated with MAM ≥ 4 mm (Ablation-fit) and ≥ 5 mm (SAFIR). The per-tumor median absolute difference in MAM quantification between both software was 2 mm (IQR: 1-3). MAM was independently associated with LTP after thermal ablation of CRLM across multicenter data and two confirmation software. Ablations achieving a MAM ≥ 5 mm were associated with local control in both software. MAMs from intraprocedural contrast-enhanced CT were independently associated with LTP after thermal ablation of CRLM across multicenter data and two confirmation software, with a margin ≥ 5 mm associated with local control in both software. Sufficient ablative margins are critical for local control following thermal ablation of CRLM. Intraprocedural CT-derived MAM was the only independent factor associated with LTP across two confirmation software. No LTP was observed in CRLM ablated with a MAM ≥ 5 mm.",2286

Patients from Münster, Freiburg, and Dresden University Hospitals were included in an external validation cohort. Using the development cohort, we created quantitative and visual PPP nomograms based on Cox regression models, assessing potential PPP predictors for overall survival, with least absolute shrinkage and selection operator penalty for overall survival as the primary endpoint. Performance was measured using Harrell's C-index in the internal and external validation cohorts and compared with established clinical risk scores (International Staging Collaboration for Cancer of the Prostate [STARCAP], European Association of Urology [EAU], and National Comprehensive Cancer Network [NCCN] risk scores) and a previous nomogram defined by Gafita et al (hereafter referred to as GAFITA) using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and area under the ROC curve (AUC) estimates. We analysed 2414 male patients (1110 included in the development cohort, 502 in the internal cohort, and 802 in the external validation cohort), among whom 901 (37%) had died as of data cutoff (June 30, 2023; median follow-up of 52·9 months [IQR 33·9-79·0]). Predictors in the quantitative PPP nomogram were locoregional lymph node metastases (molecular imaging N2), distant metastases (extrapelvic nodal metastases, bone metastases [disseminated or diffuse marrow involvement], and organ metastases), tumour volume (in L), and tumour mean standardised uptake value. Predictors in the visual PPP nomogram were distant metastases (extrapelvic nodal metastases, bone metastases [disseminated or diffuse marrow involvement], and organ metastases) and total tumour lesion count. In the internal and external validation cohorts, C-indices were 0·80 (95% CI 0·77-0·84) and 0·77 (0·75-0·78) for the quantitative nomogram, respectively, and 0·78 (0·75-0·82) and 0·77 (0·75-0·78) for the visual nomogram, respectively. In the combined development and internal validation cohort, the quantitative PPP nomogram was superior to STARCAP risk score for patients at initial staging (n=139 with available staging data; AUC 0·73 vs 0·54; p=0·018), EAU risk score at biochemical recurrence (n=412; 0·69 vs 0·52; p<0·0001), and NCCN pan-stage risk score (n=1534; 0·81 vs 0·74; p<0·0001) for the prediction of overall survival, but was similar to GAFITA nomogram for metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC; n=122; 0·76 vs 0·72; p=0·49) and metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC; n=270; 0·67 vs 0·75; p=0·20). The visual PPP nomogram was superior to EAU at biochemical recurrence (n=414; 0·64 vs 0·52; p=0·0004) and NCCN across all stages (n=1544; 0·79 vs 0·73; p<0·0001), but similar to STARCAP for initial staging (n=140; 0·56 vs 0·53; p=0·74) and GAFITA for mHSPC (n=122; 0·74 vs 0·72; p=0·66) and mCRPC (n=270; 0·71 vs 0·75; p=0·23). Our PPP nomograms accurately stratify high-risk and low-risk groups for overall survival in early and late stages of prostate cancer and yield equal or superior prediction accuracy compared with established clinical risk tools. Validation and improvement of the nomograms with long-term follow-up is ongoing (NCT06320223). Cancer Registry North-Rhine Westphalia.",4202
39088043,Accelerating breast MRI acquisition with generative AI models.,European radiology,2025,"To investigate the use of the score-based diffusion model to accelerate breast MRI reconstruction. We trained a score-based model on 9549 MRI examinations of the female breast and employed it to reconstruct undersampled MRI images with undersampling factors of 2, 5, and 20. Images were evaluated by two experienced radiologists who rated the images based on their overall quality and diagnostic value on an independent test set of 100 additional MRI examinations. The score-based model produces MRI images of high quality and diagnostic value. Both T1- and T2-weighted MRI images could be reconstructed to a high degree of accuracy. Two radiologists rated the images as almost indistinguishable from the original images (rating 4 or 5 on a scale of 5) in 100% (radiologist 1) and 99% (radiologist 2) of cases when the acceleration factor was 2. This fraction dropped to 88% and 70% for an acceleration factor of 5 and to 5% and 21% with an extreme acceleration factor of 20. Score-based models can reconstruct MRI images at high fidelity, even at comparatively high acceleration factors, but further work on a larger scale of images is needed to ensure that diagnostic quality holds. The number of MRI examinations of the breast is expected to rise with MRI screening recommended for women with dense breasts. Accelerated image acquisition methods can help in making this examination more accessible. Accelerating breast MRI reconstruction remains a significant challenge in clinical settings. Score-based diffusion models can achieve near-perfect reconstruction for moderate undersampling factors. Faster breast MRI scans with maintained image quality could revolutionize clinic workflows and patient experience.",1714
39085641,ESR Essentials: diagnostic work-up in patients with symptomatic breast disease-practice recommendations by the European Society of Breast Imaging.,European radiology,2025,"Breast complaints are frequent reasons for consultations in primary care or breast clinics. Breast pain, breast lumps, and nipple discharge are the most common complaints. Less common symptoms such as skin changes and axillary abnormalities also require specific diagnostic approaches. Imaging the symptomatic breast should be performed by appropriately trained breast radiologists following the best practice guidelines and quality standards. Full-field digital mammography (FFDM), digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT), and breast ultrasound (US) are the main modalities used in this primary setting. The choice depends on the patient's age and symptoms. Women younger than 30-years-old are first imaged by US, whereas women over 40-years-old usually require both FFDM or DBT and US. For women between 30-years-old and 40-years-old, the US is the modality of choice, whereas FFDM or DBT might also be performed if needed. Pregnant or lactating women with palpable lesions or nipple discharge are imaged with US as the first method; FFDM or DBT can also be performed depending on the degree of suspicion as the dose to the fetus is minimal, and shielding may even further reduce the dose. More advanced techniques such as breast magnetic resonance imaging or contrast-enhanced mammography are not indicated in this first diagnostic setting and are reserved for cases of established malignancy (local staging) or rare cases of equivocal findings not otherwise resolved or inflammatory breast cancer. Last, but not least, male breast symptoms should also be addressed with US and/or FFDM. CLINICAL RELEVANCE STATEMENT: It is equally important to correctly diagnose an underlying malignancy and to avoid false positives that would lead to unnecessary biopsies, increased costs, and anxiety for the patient. Proper use of imaging modalities ensures optimal diagnostic approach and minimizes false negatives. KEY POINTS: Ultrasound, full-field digital mammography, or digital breast tomosynthesis are the main imaging modalities in the diagnostic setting, while MRI or contrast-enhanced mammography should be reserved to selected cases. Initial imaging modality includes ultrasound combined with mammography or digital breast tomosynthesis depending on women's age and the presence (or not) of inconclusive findings. A negative imaging evaluation should not deter biopsy when a highly suspicious finding is found on physical examination.",2430
39080066,"Asymmetric background parenchymal enhancement on contrast-enhanced mammography: associated factors, diagnostic workup, and clinical outcome.",European radiology,2025,"To summarize our institutional experience with contrast-enhanced mammography (CEM) exams reporting asymmetric background parenchymal enhancement (BPE). Consecutive CEMs performed between December 2012 and July 2023 were retrospectively reviewed to identify exams reporting asymmetric BPE. Associated factors, the level of reporting certainty, BI-RADS score, diagnostic workup, and clinical outcome were summarized. BPE grades and BI-RADS were compared between initial CEM vs. immediate MRI and 6-month follow-up CEM, when indicated, using the Sign test. Overall, 175/12,856 (1.4%) CEMs (140 female patients, mean age, 46 ± 8.0 years) reported asymmetric BPE. Reporting certainty was mostly high (n = 86), then moderate (n = 59) and low (n = 30). Associated factors included contralateral irradiation (n = 94), recent ipsilateral breast treatment (n = 14), and unilateral breastfeeding (n = 4). BI-RADS scores were 0 (n = 21), 1/2 (n = 75), 3 (n = 67), 4 (n = 3), and 6 (n = 1), or given for a finding other than asymmetric BPE (n = 8). Initial diagnostic-workup often included targeted-US (n = 107). Immediate MRI (n = 65) and/or 6-month CEM follow-up (n = 69) downgraded most cases, with a significant decrease in BPE grade compared to the initial CEM (p < 0.01 for both). On follow-up, two underlying cancers were diagnosed in the area of questionable asymmetric BPE. Apparent asymmetric BPE is most often a benign finding with an identifiable etiology. However, rarely, it may mask an underlying malignancy presenting as non-mass enhancement, thus requiring additional scrutiny. The variability in the diagnostic-workup of apparent asymmetric background parenchymal enhancement stresses the clinical challenge of this radiological finding. Further studies are required to verify these initial observations and to establish standardized management guidelines. Apparent asymmetric background parenchymal enhancement usually represents a benign clinical correlate, though rarely it may represent malignancy. Evaluation of asymmetric background parenchymal enhancement varied considerably in the metrics that were examined. Targeted US and MRI can be useful in evaluating unexplained asymmetric background parenchymal enhancement.",2229
39080064,Follow-up of non-palpable testicular incidentalomas under 1 cm: does growth rate differentiate malignant and non-malignant lesions?,European radiology,2025,"To determine whether small, incidentally detected testicular lesions can be safely followed up, by assessing growth rate and volume threshold for benign vs. malignant lesions. This retrospective observational study includes a consecutive series of 130 testicular incidentalomas < 1 cm and with negative tumour markers identified from October 2001 to November 2022, which were initially followed up with ultrasound. A total of 39 cases proceeded to surgery during the study period, either due to lesion growth (n = 28) or patient preference/recommendation by the referring urologist (n = 11). For the lesions that were growing, specific growth rate (SGR) and doubling time (DT) were calculated assuming an exponential growth pattern. In addition, the velocity of increase of the average diameter (∆D Of the 130 nodules that were initially followed up, six disappeared, eight were reduced in size, eighty-eight were stable, and twenty-eight increased in size. For operated nodules all 18 malignant tumours, 8/9 benign tumours, and 2/12 surgically proved non-neoplastic lesions were growing. The best cut-off values of the growth indicators to differentiate between malignant and non-malignant histology were 3.47 × 10 Malignant and non-malignant small incidentalomas can be effectively differentiated based on growing parameters, even though overlap exists. An increase of the maximum diameter of about 1 mm and 2 mm in three months and in six months, respectively, suggests malignancy. Growing parameters allow an educated assessment of benign and malignant small testicular incidentalomas. Non-aggressive management is justified and safe when follow-up includes self-examination and tumour marker assessment to reduce the risk of interval tumour growth. Small, non-palpable and asymptomatic testicular nodules < 1 cm are unexpectedly discovered during scrotal ultrasound. Growth indicators estimate the potential malignancy, even though overlap with non-malignant lesions exists. Non-growing incidentalomas can be safely followed up.",2033
39078299,Dotatate PET/CT and ,Radiology,2024,"Background Somatostatin receptors, and specifically somatostatin receptor type 2 (SSTR2), have primarily been associated with neuroendocrine tumors and have revolutionized the imaging and therapy of patients with these tumors. SSTR2 is expressed on other tumors at lower prevalence. Purpose To evaluate the potential of SSTR2-targeted imaging and therapy in patients with breast cancer. Materials and Methods In a preclinical experiment, SSTR2 expression was assessed in tissue microarrays of breast cancer samples using H-score analysis. H-scores higher than 50 (0-300 scale) were considered positive. Then, a prospective phase 2 clinical trial of SSTR2-targeted tetraazacyclododecane tetraacetic acid octreotate (Dotatate) PET/CT was performed in participants with biopsy-proven estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer from January to August 2023. A positive Dotatate PET/CT scan was defined as tumors with a Krenning score of 3 (avidity greater than liver) or 4 (avidity greater than spleen). The proportion of positive scans and the 95% CI were calculated.

39078298,Assessing Digital Breast Tomosynthesis Impact on Early Cancer Detection: Insights from Consecutive Screening.,Radiology,2024,"Background Analysis of how digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) screening affects consecutive screening performance is important to estimate its future value in screening. Purpose To evaluate whether DBT contributes to early detection of breast cancer by assessing cancer detection rates (CDRs), including the fraction of invasive cancers and cancer subtypes in consecutive routine digital mammography (DM). Materials and Methods The paired prospective Malmö Breast Tomosynthesis Screening Trial (MBTST) was performed between January 2010 and February 2015. Participating women underwent one-view DBT and two-view DM at one screening occasion. In this secondary analysis, women were followed up through their first (DM1) and second (DM2) consecutive two-view DM screening rounds after MBTST participation. Cancer diagnoses were identified by referencing records. A logistic regression model, adjusted for age, was used to calculate the odds of luminal A-like cancers with use of the MBTST as reference. Results There were 14 848 final participants in the MBTST (median age, 57 years [IQR, 49-65 years]). Of those, 12 876 women were screened in DM1 (median age, 58 years [IQR, 50-66 years]) and 10 883 were screened in DM2 (median age, 59 years [IQR, 51-67 years]). Compared with CDRs in the trial of 6.5 of 1000 women (95% CI: 5.2, 7.9) for DM and 8.7 of 1000 women (95% CI: 7.3, 10.3) for DBT, the CDR was lower in DM1 (4.6 of 1000 women [95% CI: 3.6, 5.9]) and DM2 (5.3 of 1000 women [95% CI: 4.1, 6.9]). The proportion of invasive cancers was 84.9% (118 of 139 cancers) in the MBTST; the corresponding numbers were 66% (39 of 59 cancers) for DM1 and 83% (50 of 60 cancers) for DM2.

39075300,Baseline surveillance in Li Fraumeni syndrome using whole-body MRI: a systematic review and updated meta-analysis.,European radiology,2025,"Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) is a cancer syndrome associated with early-onset neoplasias. The use of whole-body magnetic resonance imaging (WBMRI) is recommended for regular cancer screening, however, evidence supporting the benefits in asymptomatic LFS patients is limited. This study aims to assess the clinical utility of WBMRI in germline TP53 mutation carriers at baseline and follow-up. We systematically searched PubMed, Cochrane, and Embase databases for studies evaluating WBMRI as an early detection method for tumor screening in patients with LFS. We pooled the prevalence of the included variables along with their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Statistical analyses were performed using R software, version 4.3.1. From 1687 results, 11 comprising 703 patients (359 females (51%); with a median age of 32 years (IQR 1-74)) were included. An estimated detection rate of 31% (95% CI: 0.28, 0.34) for any suspicious lesions was found in asymptomatic TP53 carriers who underwent baseline WBMRI. A total of 277 lesions requiring clinical follow-up were identified in 215 patients. Cancer was confirmed in 46 lesions across 39 individuals. The estimated cancer diagnosis rate among suspicious lesions was 18% (95% CI: 0.13, 0.25). WBMRI detected 41 of the 46 cancers at an early-disease stage, with an overall detection rate of 6% (95% CI: 0.05, 0.08). The incidence rate was 2% per patient round of WBMRI (95% CI: 0.01, 0.04), including baseline and follow-up. This meta-analysis provides evidence that surveillance with WBMRI is effective in detecting cancers in asymptomatic patients with LFS. Our study demonstrates that whole-body MRI is an effective tool for early cancer detection in asymptomatic Li-Fraumeni Syndrome patients, highlighting its importance in surveillance protocols to improve diagnosis and treatment outcomes. Current evidence for whole-body MRI screening of asymptomatic Li-Fraumeni Syndrome (LFS) patients remains scarce. Whole-body MRI identified 41 out of 46 cancers at an early stage, achieving an overall detection rate of 6%. Whole-body MRI surveillance is a valuable method for detecting cancers in asymptomatic LFS patients.",2176
39068376,Impact of different peak tube voltage settings on adrenal adenomas attenuation at unenhanced CT.,European radiology,2025,"To assess the influence of peak tube voltage peak setting on adrenal adenomas (AA) attenuation on unenhanced abdominal CT. IRB-approved retrospective observational cohort study. We included 89 patients with imaging-defined AAs with shortest diameter > 6 mm who underwent two or more unenhanced abdominal CTs using at least two different peak tube voltage settings. Two readers independently measured adenoma attenuation on different CT acquisitions by drawing a round ROI on 3 mm thick axial MPR reconstructions encompassing at least 2/3 of the lesion's surface. The mean of the values measured by the two readers was used for further analysis. Interobserver variability was assessed (Intraclass Correlation Coefficient). Attenuation values measured on 100, 110 and 140 kVp acquisitions were compared with standard 120 kVp ones (Bland-Altman analysis). We included 275 unenhanced abdominal CTs (3.1 ± 0.9/patient) in image analysis; 131 acquired at 120 kVp, 65 at 100 kVp, 59 at 110 kVp, and 20 at 140 kVp. 107 lesions were detected in 89 patients (1-4/patient), with a mean maximum diameter of 17 ± 6 mm. Interobserver agreement in attenuation measurement was excellent (ICC: 0.95, CI (92-97)). Median adenoma attenuation was significantly lower on 100 kVp images than on 120 kVp ones (-1 HU, IQR (-5 to 3.6), vs, 2.5 HU, IQR (-1.5 to 8.5); p < 0.001) whereas we didn't find statistically significant differences in adenoma attenuation between 110 kVp or 140 kVp and 120 kVp ones. AA attenuation is significantly lower on unenhanced CT scans acquired at 100 kVp than on those acquired at ""standard"" 120 kVp. AA attenuation is significantly lower at 100 kVp in comparison to 120 kVp. This might be exploited to increase unenhanced CT sensitivity in adenoma characterisation, but further studies including non-adenoma lesions are mandatory to confirm this hypothesis. CT scans are often acquired using peak tube voltage settings different from the ""standard"" 120 kVp. AA attenuation varies if CT scans are acquired using different tube peak voltage settings. At 100 kVp AAs show a significantly lower attenuation than at 120 kVp.",2128
39066894,Deep learning model based on contrast-enhanced ultrasound for predicting vessels encapsulating tumor clusters in hepatocellular carcinoma.,European radiology,2025,"To establish and validate a non-invasive deep learning (DL) model based on contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) to predict vessels encapsulating tumor clusters (VETC) patterns in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This retrospective study included consecutive HCC patients with preoperative CEUS images and available tissue specimens. Patients were randomly allocated into the training and test cohorts. CEUS images were analyzed using the ResNet-18 convolutional neural network for the development and validation of the VETC predictive model. The predictive value for postoperative early recurrence (ER) of the proposed model was further evaluated. A total of 242 patients were enrolled finally, including 195 in the training cohort (54.6 ± 11.2 years, 178 males) and 47 in the test cohort (55.1 ± 10.6 years, 40 males). The DL model (DL signature) achieved favorable performance in both the training cohort (area under the receiver operating characteristics curve [AUC]: 0.92, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.88-0.96) and test cohort (AUC: 0.90, 95% CI: 0.82-0.99). The stratified analysis demonstrated good discrimination of DL signature regardless of tumor size. Moreover, the DL signature was found independently correlated with postoperative ER (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.99, 95% CI: 1.29-3.06, p = 0.002). C-indexes of 0.70 and 0.73 were achieved when the DL signature was used to predict ER independently and combined with clinical features. The proposed DL signature provides a non-invasive and practical method for VETC-HCC prediction, and contributes to the identification of patients with high risk of postoperative ER. This DL model based on contrast-enhanced US displayed an important role in non-invasive diagnosis and prognostication for patients with VETC-HCC, which was helpful in individualized management. Preoperative biopsy to determine VETC status in HCC patients is limited. The contrast-enhanced DL model provides a non-invasive tool for the prediction of VETC-HCC. The proposed deep-learning signature assisted in identifying patients with a high risk of postoperative ER.",2089
39058970,Prospective Study of Supplemental Screening With Contrast-Enhanced Mammography in Women With Elevated Risk of Breast Cancer: Results of the Prevalence Round.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,2024,"Contrast-enhanced mammography (CEM) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have shown similar diagnostic performance in detection of breast cancer. Limited CEM data are available for high-risk breast cancer screening. The purpose of the study was to prospectively investigate the efficacy of supplemental screening CEM in elevated risk patients. A prospective, single-institution, institutional review board-approved observational study was conducted in asymptomatic elevated risk women age 35 years or older who had a negative conventional two-dimensional digital breast tomosynthesis screening mammography (MG) and no additional supplemental screening within the prior 12 months. Four hundred sixty women were enrolled from February 2019 to April 2021. The median age was 56.8 (range, 35.0-79.2) years; 408 of 460 (88.7%) were mammographically dense. Biopsy revealed benign changes in 22 women (22/37, 59%), high-risk lesions in four women (4/37, 11%), and breast cancer in 11 women (11/37, 30%). Fourteen cancers (10 invasive, tumor size range 4-15 mm, median 9 mm) were diagnosed in 11 women. The overall supplemental cancer detection rate was 23.9 per 1,000 patients, 95% CI (12.0 to 42.4). All cancers were grade 1 or 2, ER+ ERBB2-, and node negative. CEM imaging screening offered high specificity (0.875 [95% CI, 0.844 to 0.906]), high NPV (0.998 [95% CI, 0.993 to 1.000), moderate PPV1 (0.164 [95% CI, 0.076 to 0.253), moderate PPV3 (0.275 [95% CI, 0.137 to 0.413]), and high sensitivity (0.917 [95% CI, 0.760 to 1.000]). At least 1 year of imaging follow-up was available on all patients, and one interval cancer was detected on breast MRI 4 months after negative screening CEM. A pilot trial demonstrates a supplemental cancer detection rate of 23.9 per 1,000 in women at an elevated risk for breast cancer. Larger, multi-institutional, multiyear CEM trials in patients at elevated risk are needed for validation.",1922
39042304,Effectiveness of microvascular flow imaging for radiofrequency ablation in recurrent thyroid cancer: comparison with power Doppler imaging.,European radiology,2025,"To compare microvascular flow imaging (MVFI) and power Doppler ultrasonography imaging (PDUS) for detecting intratumoral vascularity in recurrent thyroid cancer both before and after radiofrequency ablation (RFA). This retrospective study included 80 patients (age, 57 ± 12 years; 54 women) with 110 recurrent tumors who underwent RFA between January 2021 and June 2023. A total of 151 PDUS and MVFI image sets were analyzed (85 pre-RFA, 66 post-RFA). Two readers assessed vascularity on the images using a four-point scale with a 2-week interval between PDUS and MVFI to estimate inter-reader agreement. Intra-reader agreement was determined by reinterpreting images in reverse order (MVFI-PDUS) after a 1-month gap. Additionally, diagnostic performance for identifying viable tumors after RFA was assessed in 44 lesions using thyroid-protocol CT as a reference standard. MVFI demonstrated higher vascular grades than PDUS, both before (reader 1: 3.04 ± 1.15 vs. 1.93 ± 1.07, p < 0.001; reader 2: 3.20 ± 0.96 vs. 2.12 ± 1.07, p < 0.001) and after RFA (reader 1: 2.44 ± 1.28 vs. 1.67 ± 1.06, p < 0.001; reader 2: 2.62 ± 1.23 vs. 1.83 ± 0.99, p < 0.001). Inter-reader agreement was substantial (κ = 0.743) and intra-reader agreement was almost perfect (κ = 0.840). MVFI showed higher sensitivity (81.5%-88.9%) and accuracy (84.1%-86.4%) than PDUS (sensitivity: 51.9%, p < 0.01; accuracy: 63.6-70.5%, p < 0.04), without sacrificing specificity. MVFI was superior to PDUS for assessing intratumoral vascularity and showed good inter- and intra-reader agreement, highlighting its clinical value for assessing pre-RFA vascularity and accurately identifying post-RFA viable tumors in recurrent thyroid cancer. Microvascular flow imaging (MVFI) is superior to power-Doppler US for assessing intratumoral vascularity; therefore, MVFI can be a valuable tool for assessing vascularity before radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and for identifying viable tumors after RFA in patients with recurrent thyroid cancer. The value of microvascular flow imaging (MVFI) for evaluating intratumoral vascularity is unexplored. MVFI demonstrated higher vascular grades than power Doppler US before and after ablation. Microvascular flow imaging showed higher sensitivity and accuracy than power Doppler US without sacrificing specificity.",2311
39042303,Validation of a commercially available CAD-system for lung nodule detection and characterization using CT-scans.,European radiology,2025,"This study aims to externally validate a commercially available Computer-Aided Detection (CAD)-system for the automatic detection and characterization of solid, part-solid, and ground-glass lung nodules (LN) on CT scans. This retrospective study encompasses 263 chest CT scans performed between January 2020 and December 2021 at a Dutch university hospital. All scans were read by a radiologist (R1) and compared with the initial radiology report. Conflicting scans were assessed by an adjudicating radiologist (R2). All scans were also processed by CAD. The standalone performance of CAD in terms of sensitivity and false-positive (FP)-rate for detection was calculated together with the sensitivity for characterization, including texture, calcification, speculation, and location. The R1's detection sensitivity was also assessed. A total of 183 true nodules were identified in 121 nodule-containing scans (142 non-nodule-containing scans), of which R1 identified 165/183 (90.2%). CAD detected 149 nodules, of which 12 were not identified by R1, achieving a sensitivity of 149/183 (81.4%) with an FP-rate of 49/121 (0.405). CAD's detection sensitivity for solid, part-solid, and ground-glass LNs was 82/94 (87.2%), 42/47 (89.4%), and 25/42 (59.5%), respectively. The classification accuracy for solid, part-solid, and ground-glass LNs was 81/82 (98.8%), 16/42 (38.1%), and 18/25 (72.0%), respectively. Additionally, CAD demonstrated overall classification accuracies of 137/149 (91.9%), 123/149 (82.6%), and 141/149 (94.6%) for calcification, spiculation, and location, respectively. Although the overall detection rate of this system slightly lags behind that of a radiologist, CAD is capable of detecting different LNs and thereby has the potential to enhance a reader's detection rate. While promising characterization performances are obtained, the tool's performance in terms of texture classification remains a subject of concern. Numerous lung nodule computer-aided detection-systems are commercially available, with some of them solely being externally validated based on their detection performance on solid nodules. We encourage researchers to assess performances by incorporating all relevant characteristics, including part-solid and ground-glass nodules. Few computer-aided detection (CAD) systems are externally validated for automatic detection and characterization of lung nodules. A detection sensitivity of 81.4% and an overall texture classification sensitivity of 77.2% were measured utilizing CAD. CAD has the potential to increase single reader detection rate, however, improvement in texture classification is required.",2645
39041940,Screening Outcomes of Mammography with AI in Dense Breasts: A Comparative Study with Supplemental Screening US.,Radiology,2024,"Background Comparative performance between artificial intelligence (AI) and breast US for women with dense breasts undergoing screening mammography remains unclear. Purpose To compare the performance of mammography alone, mammography with AI, and mammography plus supplemental US for screening women with dense breasts, and to investigate the characteristics of the detected cancers. Materials and Methods A retrospective database search identified consecutive asymptomatic women (≥40 years of age) with dense breasts who underwent mammography plus supplemental whole-breast handheld US from January 2017 to December 2018 at a primary health care center. Sequential reading for mammography alone and mammography with the aid of an AI system was conducted by five breast radiologists, and their recall decisions were recorded. Results of the combined mammography and US examinations were collected from the database. A dedicated breast radiologist reviewed marks for mammography alone or with AI to confirm lesion identification. The reference standard was histologic examination and 1-year follow-up data.

39038822,Estimating sojourn time and sensitivity of screening for ovarian cancer using a Bayesian framework.,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,2024,"Ovarian cancer is among the leading causes of gynecologic cancer-related death. Past ovarian cancer screening trials using combination of cancer antigen 125 testing and transvaginal ultrasound failed to yield statistically significant mortality reduction. Estimates of ovarian cancer sojourn time-that is, the period from when the cancer is first screen detectable until clinical detection-may inform future screening programs. We modeled ovarian cancer progression as a continuous time Markov chain and estimated screening modality-specific sojourn time and sensitivity using a Bayesian approach. Model inputs were derived from the screening arms (multimodal and ultrasound) of the UK Collaborative Trial of Ovarian Cancer Screening and the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian cancer screening trials. We assessed the quality of our estimates by using the posterior predictive P value. We derived histology-specific sojourn times by adjusting the overall sojourn time based on the corresponding histology-specific survival from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program. The overall ovarian cancer sojourn time was 2.1 years (posterior predictive P value = .469) in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian studies, with 65.7% screening sensitivity. The sojourn time was 2.0 years (posterior predictive P value = .532) in the United Kingdom Collaborative Trial of Ovarian Cancer Screening's multimodal screening arm and 2.4 years (posterior predictive P value = .640) in the ultrasound screening arm, with sensitivities of 93.2% and 64.5%, respectively. Stage-specific screening sensitivities in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian studies were 39.1% and 82.9% for early-stage and advanced-stage disease, respectively. The histology-specific sojourn times ranged from 0.8 to 1.8 years for type II ovarian cancer and 2.9 to 6.6 years for type I ovarian cancer. Annual screening is not effective for all ovarian cancer subtypes. Screening sensitivity for early-stage ovarian cancers is not sufficient for substantial mortality reduction.",2062

Patients with HCC who underwent immunotherapy between 2017 and 2023 and received multi-phasic contrast-enhanced MRIs pre- and post-treatment were included in this retrospective study. Tumor response was measured using 1D, RECIST 1.1, and mRECIST, and 3D, volumetric, and percentage quantitative EASL (vqEASL and %qEASL). Patients were grouped into disease control vs progression and responders vs non-responders. Kaplan-Meier curves analyzed with log-rank tests assessed the predictive value for mOS. Cox regression modeling evaluated the association of clinical baseline parameters with mOS. This study included 37 patients (mean age, 69.1 years [SD, 8.0]; 33 men). The mOS was 16.9 months. 3D vqEASL and %qEASL successfully stratified patients into disease control and progression (vqEASL: HR 0.21, CI: 0.55-0.08, p < 0.001; %qEASL: HR 0.18, CI: 0.83-0.04, p = 0.013), as well as responder and nonresponder (vqEASL: HR 0.25, CI: 0.08-0.74, p = 0.007; %qEASL: HR 0.17, CI: 0.04-0.72, p = 0.007) for predicting mOS. The 1D criteria, mRECIST stratified into disease control and progression only (HR 0.24, CI: 0.65-0.09, p = 0.002), and RECIST 1.1 showed no predictive value in either stratification. Multivariate Cox regression identified alpha-fetoprotein > 500 ng/mL as a predictor for poor mOS (p = 0.04). The 3D quantitative enhancement-based response assessment tool qEASL can predict overall survival in patients undergoing immunotherapy for HCC and could identify non-responders. Using 3D quantitative enhancement-based tumor response criteria (qEASL), radiologists' predictions of tumor response in patients undergoing immunotherapy for HCC can be further improved. MRI-based tumor response criteria predict immunotherapy survival benefits in HCC patients. 3D tumor response assessment methods surpass current evaluation criteria in predicting overall survival during HCC immunotherapy. Enhancement-based 3D tumor response criteria are robust prognosticators of survival for HCC patients on immunotherapy.",2199

This was a single-center retrospective study enrolling patients who underwent resection for BCLC A and B HCC and preoperative contrast-enhanced MRI. Quantitative total tumor volume (cm A total of 592 patients were included, with 525 and 67 patients assigned to BCLC A and B, respectively (2-year ER rate: 30.0% vs. 45.3%; hazard ratio (HR) = 1.8; p = 0.007). TTB was the most important predictor of ER (HR = 2.2; p < 0.001). Using 6.84% as the threshold of TTB, two ER risk strata were obtained in overall (p < 0.001), BCLC A (p < 0.001), and BCLC B (p = 0.027) patients, respectively. The BCLC B low-TTB patients had a similar risk for ER to BCLC A patients and thus were reassigned to a BCLC A TTB determined by DL-based automated segmentation at MRI was a predictive biomarker for postoperative ER and facilitated refined subcategorization of patients within BCLC stages A and B. Total tumor burden derived by deep learning-based automated segmentation at MRI may serve as an imaging biomarker for predicting early recurrence, thereby improving subclassification of Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer A and B hepatocellular carcinoma patients after hepatectomy. Total tumor burden (TTB) is important for Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) staging, but is heterogenous.

An EMBASE and PubMed search was undertaken, identifying all studies meeting the inclusion criteria performed before May 10, 2023. Random effect models were used to estimate pooled prevalence, ILA progression rates, and odds ratio for radiological progression based on radiological subtype. Subgroup analyses were performed to compare the general and high-risk populations for lung cancer. The quality of the included studies was evaluated using the risk of bias assessment tool for non-randomized studies. We analyzed 19 studies (241,541 patients) and 10 studies (1317 patients) for the pooled prevalence and progression rate of ILA, respectively. The pooled ILA prevalence was 9.7% (95% CI, 6.1-13.9%). The pooled prevalence was 6.8% (95% CI, 3.1-11.6%) and 7.1% (95% CI, 2.2-14.4%) in the general (six studies) and high-risk population for lung cancer (six studies), respectively. The pooled progression rate was 47.1% (95% CI, 29.1-65.5%).

39017933,Breast density effect on the sensitivity of digital screening mammography in a UK cohort.,European radiology,2025,"To assess the performance of breast cancer screening by category of breast density and age in a UK screening cohort. Raw full-field digital mammography data from a single site in the UK, forming a consecutive 3-year cohort of women aged 50 to 70 years from 2016 to 2018, were obtained retrospectively. Breast density was assessed using Volpara software. Examinations were grouped by density category and age group (50-60 and 61-70 years) to analyse screening performance. Statistical analysis was performed to determine the association between density categories and age groups. Volumetric breast density was assessed as a binary classifier of interval cancers (ICs) to find an optimal density threshold. Forty-nine thousand nine-hundred forty-eight screening examinations (409 screen-detected cancers (SDCs) and 205 ICs) were included in the analysis. Mammographic sensitivity, SDC/(SDC + IC), decreased with increasing breast density from 75.0% for density a (p = 0.839, comparisons made to category b), to 73.5%, 59.8% (p = 0.001), and 51.3% (p < 0.001) in categories b, c, and d, respectively. IC rates were highest in the densest categories with rates of 1.8 (p = 0.039), 3.2, 5.7 (p < 0.001), and 7.9 (p < 0.001) per thousand for categories a, b, c, and d, respectively. The recall rate increased with breast density, leading to more false positive recalls, especially in the younger age group. There was no significant difference between the optimal density threshold found, 6.85, and that Volpara defined as the b/c boundary, 7.5. The performance of screening is significantly reduced with increasing density with IC rates in the densest category four times higher than in women with fatty breasts. False positives are a particular issue for the younger subgroup without prior examinations. In women attending screening there is significant underdiagnosis of breast cancer in those with dense breasts, most marked in the highest density category but still three times higher than in women with fatty breasts in the second highest category. Breast density can mask cancers leading to underdiagnosis on mammography. Interval cancer rate increased with breast density categories 'a' to 'd'; 1.8 to 7.9 per thousand. Recall rates increased with increasing breast density, leading to more false positive recalls.",2315
39014088,Ultrafast sequence-based prediction model and nomogram to differentiate additional suspicious lesions on preoperative breast MRI.,European radiology,2025,"To investigate whether ultrafast sequence improves the diagnostic performance of conventional dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) in differentiating additional suspicious lesions (ASLs) on preoperative breast MRI. A retrospective database search identified 668 consecutive patients who underwent preoperative breast DCE-MRI with ultrafast sequence between June 2020 and July 2021. Among these, 107 ASLs from 98 patients with breast cancer (36 multifocal, 42 multicentric, and 29 contralateral) were identified. Clinical, pathological, conventional MRI findings, and ultrafast sequence-derived parameters were collected. A prediction model that adds ultrafast sequence-derived parameters to clinical, pathological, and conventional MRI findings was developed and validated internally. Decision curve analysis and net reclassification index statistics were performed. A nomogram was constructed. The ultrafast model adding time to peak enhancement, time to enhancement, and maximum slope showed a significantly increased area under the receiver operating characteristic curve compared with the conventional model which includes age, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 expression of index cancer, size of index cancer, lesion type of index cancer, location of ASL, and size of ASL (0.92 vs. 0.82; p = 0.002). The decision curve analysis showed that the ultrafast model had a higher overall net benefit than the conventional model. The net reclassification index of ultrafast model was 23.3% (p = 0.001). A combination of ultrafast sequence-derived parameters with clinical, pathological, and conventional MRI findings can aid in the differentiation of ASL on preoperative breast MRI. Our prediction model and nomogram that was based on ultrafast sequence-derived parameters could help radiologists differentiate ASLs on preoperative breast MRI. Ultrafast MRI can diminish background parenchymal enhancement and possibly improve diagnostic accuracy for additional suspicious lesions (ASLs). Location of ASL, larger size of ASL, and higher maximum slope were associated with malignant ASL. The ultrafast model and nomogram can help preoperatively differentiate additional malignancies.",2213
39014087,Radiation exposure and estimated risk of radiation-induced cancer from thoracic and abdominal radiographs in 1307 neonates.,European radiology,2025,"This study examined radiation exposure and the possible risk of radiation-induced cancer in a large sample of newborn and premature patients. In this retrospective study, we included all hospitalised neonates treated at our university hospital who received at least one X-ray examination from 1 January 2013 to 31 December 2018. We evaluated the dose area product (DAP), effective dose (ED), and estimated risk. The International Commission on Radiological Protection Publication 60 defines values (2.8-13 × 10 Of the 3843 patients (aged 241.1 ± 35.45 days) treated in the neonatal care unit, 1307 (34%) received at least one X-ray. The mean number of X-ray examinations per patient was 3.19 and correlated negatively with birth weight. The mean cumulative DAP was 5.9 mGy*cm There is a strong correlation between immaturity, the number of X-ray examinations, and radiation exposure. The total exposure was minimal, and the number of X-rays per patient has been decreasing in recent years. Possible risks to newborns and premature infants caused by ionising X-rays are often the subject of scientific and clinical discussion. Nevertheless, conventional X-ray imaging remains a frequently used tool, and total exposure remains at a very low level. The number of X-rays per patient has been decreasing in a large university hospital. Half of all patients received only one X-ray; most had a birth weight over 1500 g. This radiation risk can be classified as 'minimal' for patients with a birth weight of < 500 g and as 'negligible' for others.",1541
39014086,Evaluating the quality of radiomics-based studies for endometrial cancer using RQS and METRICS tools.,European radiology,2025,"To assess the methodological quality of radiomics-based models in endometrial cancer using the radiomics quality score (RQS) and METhodological radiomICs score (METRICS). We systematically reviewed studies published by October 30th, 2023. Inclusion criteria were original radiomics studies on endometrial cancer using CT, MRI, PET, or ultrasound. Articles underwent a quality assessment by novice and expert radiologists using RQS and METRICS. The inter-rater reliability for RQS and METRICS among radiologists with varying expertise was determined. Subgroup analyses were performed to assess whether scores varied according to study topic, imaging technique, publication year, and journal quartile. Sixty-eight studies were analysed, with a median RQS of 11 (IQR, 9-14) and METRICS score of 67.6% (IQR, 58.8-76.0); two different articles reached maximum RQS of 19 and METRICS of 90.7%, respectively. Most studies utilised MRI (82.3%) and machine learning methods (88.2%). Characterisation and recurrence risk stratification were the most explored outcomes, featured in 35.3% and 19.1% of articles, respectively. High inter-rater reliability was observed for both RQS (ICC: 0.897; 95% CI: 0.821, 0.946) and METRICS (ICC: 0.959; 95% CI: 0.928, 0.979). Methodological limitations such as lack of external validation suggest areas for improvement. At subgroup analyses, no statistically significant difference was noted. Whilst using RQS, the quality of endometrial cancer radiomics research was apparently unsatisfactory, METRICS depicts a good overall quality. Our study highlights the need for strict compliance with quality metrics. Adhering to these quality measures can increase the consistency of radiomics towards clinical application in the pre-operative management of endometrial cancer. Both the RQS and METRICS can function as instrumental tools for identifying different methodological deficiencies in endometrial cancer radiomics research. However, METRICS also reflected a focus on the practical applicability and clarity of documentation. The topic of radiomics currently lacks standardisation, limiting clinical implementation. METRICS scores were generally higher than the RQS, reflecting differences in the development process and methodological content. A positive trend in METRICS score may suggest growing attention to methodological aspects in radiomics research.",2383

39012526,Radiation exposure and screening yield by digital breast tomosynthesis compared to mammography: results of the TOSYMA Trial breast density related.,European radiology,2025,"The randomized TOmosynthesis plus SYnthesized MAmmography (TOSYMA) screening trial has shown that digital breast tomosynthesis plus synthesized mammography (DBT + SM) is superior to digital mammography (DM) in invasive breast cancer detection varying with breast density. On the other hand, the overall average glandular dose (AGD) of DBT is higher than that of DM. Comparing the DBT + SM and DM trial arm, we analyzed here the mean AGD and their determinants per breast density category and related them to the respective invasive cancer detection rates (iCDR). TOSYMA screened 99,689 women aged 50 to 69 years. Compression force, resulting breast thickness, the calculated AGD obtained from each mammography device, and previously published iCDR were used for comparisons across breast density categories in the two trial arms. There were 196,622 exposures of 49,227 women (DBT + SM) and 197,037 exposures of 49,132 women (DM) available for analyses. Mean breast thicknesses declined from breast density category A (fatty) to D (extremely dense) in both trial arms. However, while the mean AGD in the DBT + SM arm declined concomitantly from category A (2.41 mGy) to D (1.89 mGy), it remained almost unchanged in the DM arm (1.46 and 1.51 mGy, respectively). In relative terms, the AGD elevation in the DBT + SM arm (64.4% (A), by 44.5% (B), 27.8% (C), and 26.0% (D)) was lowest in dense breasts where, however, the highest iCDR were observed. Women with dense breasts may specifically benefit from DBT + SM screening as high cancer detection is achieved with only moderate AGD elevations. TOSYMA suggests a favorable constellation for screening with digital breast tomosynthesis plus synthesized mammography (DBT + SM) in dense breasts when weighing average glandular dose elevation against raised invasive breast cancer detection rates. There is potential for density-, i.e., risk-adapted population-wide breast cancer screening with DBT + SM. Breast thickness declines with visually increasing density in digital mammography (DM) and digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT). Average glandular doses of DBT decrease with increasing density; digital mammography shows lower and more constant values. With the smallest average glandular dose difference in dense breasts, DBT plus SM had the highest difference in invasive breast cancer detection rates.",2349
39012279,Interim Phase II Results Using Panitumumab-IRDye800CW during Transoral Robotic Surgery in Patients with Oropharyngeal Cancer.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,2024,"The incidence of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) has continually increased during the past several decades. Using transoral robotic surgery (TORS) significantly improves functional outcomes relative to open surgery for OPSCC. However, TORS limits tactile feedback, which is often the most important element of cancer surgery. Fluorescence-guided surgery (FGS) strategies to aid surgeon assessment of malignancy for resection are in various phases of clinical research but exhibit the greatest potential impact for improving patient care when the surgeon receives limited tactile feedback, such as during TORS. Here, we assessed the feasibility of intraoperative fluorescence imaging using panitumumab-IRDye800CW (PAN800) during TORS in patients with OPSCC. Twelve consecutive patients with OPSCC were enrolled as part of a nonrandomized, prospective, phase II FGS clinical trial using PAN800. TORS was performed with an integrated robot camera for surgeon assessment of fluorescence. Intraoperative and ex vivo fluorescence signals in tumors and normal tissue were quantified and correlated with histopathology. Intraoperative robot fluorescence views delineated OPSCC from normal tissue throughout the TORS procedure (10.7 mean tumor-to-background ratio), including in tumors with low expression of the molecular target. Tumor-specific fluorescence was consistent with surgeon-defined tumor borders requiring resection. Intraoperative robot fluorescence imaging revealed an OPSCC fragment initially overlooked during TORS based on brightfield views, further substantiating the clinical benefit of this FGS approach. The results from this patient with OPSCC cohort support further clinical assessment of FGS during TORS to aid resection of solid tumors.",1767

The comparative accuracy of multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) versus dual-energy CT (DECT) for staging of GC is not known. Purpose To compare the diagnostic accuracy of personalized mpMRI with that of DECT for local-regional T and N staging in patients with GC receiving curative surgical intervention. Materials and Methods Patients with GC who underwent gastric mpMRI and DECT before gastrectomy with lymphadenectomy were eligible for this single-center prospective noninferiority study between November 2021 and September 2022. mpMRI comprised T2-weighted imaging, multiorientational zoomed diffusion-weighted imaging, and extradimensional volumetric interpolated breath-hold examination dynamic contrast-enhanced imaging. Dual-phase DECT images were reconstructed at 40 keV and standard 120 kVp-like images. Using gastrectomy specimens as the reference standard, the diagnostic accuracy of mpMRI and DECT for T and N staging was compared by six radiologists in a pairwise blinded manner. Interreader agreement was assessed using the weighted κ and Kendall W statistics. The McNemar test was used for head-to-head accuracy comparisons between DECT and mpMRI. Results This study included 202 participants (mean age, 62 years ± 11 [SD]; 145 male). The interreader agreement of the six readers for T and N staging of GC was excellent for both mpMRI (κ = 0.89 and 0.85, respectively) and DECT (κ = 0.86 and 0.84, respectively).

38995382,Diagnostic performance of ADC and ADCratio in MRI-based prostate cancer assessment: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,European radiology,2025,"To identify factors influencing the diagnostic performance of the quantitative imaging biomarkers ADC and ADCratio in prostate cancer (PCa) detection. A systematic literature search was conducted in Embase, Medline and Web of Science, for studies evaluating ADC values and ADCratio for PCa diagnosis, using the same patient cohorts and using histopathological references as ground truth. Pooled sensitivities, specificities, summary ROC curves and AUCs were calculated from constructed contingency data tables. Diagnostic performance (AUC) was quantitatively pooled using a bivariate mixed effects model. For identifying influencing factors, subgroup analysis, publication bias and heterogeneity assessment were investigated. Thirteen studies, involving 1038 patients and 1441 lesions, were included. For ADC, the pooled sensitivity and specificity was 80% (95% CI: 74-85%) and 78% (95% CI: 70-85%), respectively. For ADCratio pooled sensitivity and specificity was 80% (95% CI: 74-84%) and 80% (95% CI: 71-87%). Summary ROC analysis revealed AUCs of 0.86 (95% CI: 0.83-0.89) and 0.86 (95% CI: 0.83-0.89), respectively. Meta-regression showed heterogeneity between both imaging biomarkers. Subgroup analysis showed that ADCratio improved diagnostic performance in comparison to ADC when including both peripheral and transitional zone lesions (AUC: 0.87 [95% CI: 0.84-0.90] and 0.82 [95% CI: 0.79-0.85], respectively). Both ADC and ADCratio imaging biomarkers showed good and comparable diagnostic performance in PCa diagnosis. However, ADCratio shows better diagnostic performance than ADC in diagnosing transition zone cancers. In quantitative MRI-based PCa diagnosis, the imaging biomarker ADCratio is useful in challenging MRI readings of lesions. Understanding the performance of quantitative imaging biomarkers better can aid diagnostic MRI protocols, enhancing the precision of PCa assessments. MRI diffusion-weighted imaging-based ADC and ADCratio have comparable diagnostic performance in PCa assessment. In contrast to ADC, the ADCratio improves diagnostic performance, when assessing whole gland lesions. Compared to ADCratio, the ADC demonstrates enhanced diagnostic performance when evaluating peripheral zone lesions.",2231
38992111,Mammographic features differ with body composition in women with breast cancer.,European radiology,2025,"There are several breast cancer (BC) risk factors-many related to body composition, hormonal status, and fertility patterns. However, it is not known if risk factors in healthy women are associated with specific mammographic features at the time of BC diagnosis. Our aim was to assess the potential association between pre-diagnostic body composition and mammographic features in the diagnostic BC image. The prospective Malmö Diet and Cancer Study includes women with invasive BC from 1991 to 2014 (n = 1116). BC risk factors at baseline were registered (anthropometric measures, menopausal status, and parity) along with mammography data from BC diagnosis (breast density, mammographic tumor appearance, and mode of detection). We investigated associations between anthropometric measures and mammographic features via logistic regression analyses, yielding odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). There was an association between high body mass index (BMI) (≥ 30) at baseline and spiculated tumor appearance (OR 1.370 (95% CI: 0.941-2.010)), primarily in women with clinically detected cancers (OR 2.240 (95% CI: 1.280-3.940)), and in postmenopausal women (OR 1.580 (95% CI: 1.030-2.440)). Furthermore, an inverse association between high BMI (≥ 30) and high breast density (OR 0.270 (95% CI: 0.166-0.438)) was found. This study demonstrated an association between obesity and a spiculated mass on mammography-especially in women with clinically detected cancers and in postmenopausal women. These findings offer insights on the relationship between risk factors in healthy women and related mammographic features in subsequent BC. With increasing numbers of both BC incidence and women with obesity, it is important to highlight mammographic findings in women with an unhealthy weight. Women with obesity and BC may present with certain mammographic features. Spiculated masses were more common in women with obesity, especially postmenopausal women, and those with clinically detected BCs. Insights on the relationship between obesity and related mammographic features will aid mammographic interpretation.",2124

38992109,Intraindividual comparison of CT and MRI for predicting vessels encapsulating tumor clusters in hepatocellular carcinoma.,European radiology,2025,"To establish and validate scoring models for predicting vessels encapsulating tumor clusters (VETC) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) using computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and to intra-individually compare the predictive performance between the two modalities. We retrospectively included 324 patients with surgically confirmed HCC who underwent preoperative dynamic CT and MRI with extracellular contrast agent between June 2019 and August 2020. These patients were then divided into a discovery cohort (n = 227) and a validation cohort (n = 97). Imaging features and Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System (LI-RADS) categories of VETC-positive HCCs were evaluated. Logistic regression analyses were conducted on the discovery cohort to identify clinical and imaging predictors associated with VETC-positive cases. Subsequently, separate CT-based and MRI-based scoring models were developed, and their diagnostic performance was compared using generalized estimating equations. On both CT and MRI, VETC-positive HCCs exhibited a higher frequency of size > 5.0 cm, necrosis or severe ischemia, non-smooth tumor margin, targetoid appearance, intratumor artery, and heterogeneous enhancement with septations or irregular ring-like structure compared to VETC-negative HCCs (all p < 0.05). Regarding LI-RADS categories, VETC-positive HCCs were more frequently categorized as LR-M than VETC-negative cases (all p < 0.05). In the validation cohort, the CT-based model showed similar sensitivity (76.7% vs. 86.7%, p = 0.375), specificity (83.6% vs. 74.6%, p = 0.180), and area under the curve value (0.80 vs. 0.81, p = 0.910) to the MRI-based model in predicting VETC-positive HCCs. Preoperative CT and MRI demonstrated comparable performance in the identification of VETC-positive HCCs, thus displaying promising predictive capabilities. Both computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated promise in preoperatively identifying the vessel-encapsulating tumor cluster pattern in hepatocellular carcinoma, with no statistically significant difference between the two modalities, potentially adding additional prognostic value. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) show promise in the preoperative identification of vessels encapsulating tumor clusters-positive hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). HCC with vessels encapsulating tumor cluster patterns were more frequently LR-M compared to those without. These CT and MRI models showed comparable ability in identifying vessels encapsulating tumor clusters-positive HCC.",2581
38992106,3D-CEUS/MRI-CEUS fusion imaging vs 2D-CEUS after locoregional therapies for hepatocellular carcinoma: a multicenter prospective study of therapeutic response evaluation.,European radiology,2025,"To compare the diagnostic accuracy of 3D contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS)/MRI-CEUS fusion imaging with 2D-CEUS in assessing the response of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) to locoregional therapies in a multicenter prospective study. A consecutive series of patients with HCC scheduled for locoregional treatment were enrolled between April 2021 and March 2023. Patients were randomly divided into 3D-CEUS/MRI-CEUS fusion imaging group (3D/fusion group) or 2D-CEUS group (2D group). CEUS was performed 1 week before and 4-6 weeks after locoregional treatment. Contrast-enhanced MRI (CE-MRI) 4-6 weeks after treatment was set as the reference standard. CEUS images were evaluated for the presence or absence of viable tumors. Diagnostic performance criteria, including sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and area under the curve (AUC), were determined for each modality. A total of 140 patients were included, 70 patients in the 2D group (mean age, 60.2 ± 10.4 years) and 70 patients in the 3D/fusion group (mean age, 59.8 ± 10.6 years). The sensitivity of the 3D/fusion group was 100.0% (95% CI: 75.9, 100.0), higher than that of the 2D group (55.6%, 95% CI: 22.7, 84.7; p = 0.019). The specificity of the 3D/fusion group was 96.3% (95% CI: 86.2, 99.4), which was comparable to that of the 2D group (98.4%, 95% CI: 90.0, 99.9; p = 0.915). The AUC of the 3D/fusion group was 0.98 (95% CI: 0.95, 1.00), higher than that of the 2D group (0.77, 95% CI: 0.56, 0.98; p = 0.020). 3D-CEUS/MRI-CEUS fusion imaging exhibits superior diagnostic accuracy in evaluating the treatment response to locoregional therapies for HCC. 3D-CEUS/MRI-CEUS fusion imaging can be applied for post-treatment assessment of residual tumors in HCC undergoing locoregional treatment, offering potential benefits in terms of accurate diagnosis and clinical management. Evaluating for HCC recurrence following locoregional therapy is important. 3D-CEUS/MRI-CEUS fusion imaging achieved a higher sensitivity than 2D-CEUS in assessing residual tumors after locoregional therapies. 3D-CEUS/MRI-CEUS fusion imaging can help clinicians intervene early in residual HCC lesions after locoregional treatment.",2170
38990324,Breast lesions on MRI in mass and non-mass enhancement: Kaiser score and modified Kaiser score + for readers of variable experience.,European radiology,2025,"To compare the diagnostic performance of three readers using BI-RADS and Kaiser score (KS) based on mass and non-mass enhancement (NME) lesions. A total of 630 lesions, 393 malignant and 237 benign, 458 mass and 172 NME, were analyzed. Three radiologists with 3 years, 6 years, and 13 years of experience made diagnoses. 596 cases had diffusion-weighted imaging, and the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) was measured. For lesions with ADC > 1.4 × 10 When using BI-RADS, AUC was 0.878, 0.915, and 0.941 for mass, and 0.771, 0.838, 0.902 for NME for Reader-1, 2, and 3, respectively, better for mass than for NME. The diagnostic accuracy of KS was improved compared to BI-RADS for less experienced readers. For Reader-1, AUC was increased from 0.878 to 0.916 for mass (p = 0.005) and from 0.771 to 0.822 for NME (p = 0.124). Based on the cut-off value of BI-RADS ≥ 4B and KS ≥ 5 as malignant, the sensitivity of KS by Readers-1 and -2 was significantly higher for both Mass and NME. When ADC was considered to change to modified KS +, the AUC and the accuracy for all three readers were improved, showing higher specificity with slightly degraded sensitivity. The benefit of KS compared to BI-RADS was most noticeable for the less experienced readers in improving sensitivity. Compared to KS, KS + can improve specificity for all three readers. For NME, the KS and KS + criteria need to be further improved. KS provides an intuitive method for diagnosing lesions on breast MRI. BI-RADS and KS face greater difficulties in evaluating NME compared to mass lesions. Adding ADC to the KS can improve specificity with slightly degraded sensitivity. KS provides an intuitive method for interpreting breast lesions on MRI, most helpful for novice readers. KS, compared to BI-RADS, improved sensitivity in both mass and NME groups for less experienced readers. NME lesions were considered during the development of the KS flowchart, but may need to be better defined.",1961
38990096,"Differences in the Prognostic Role of Age, Extent of Resection, and Tumor Grade between Astrocytoma IDHmt and Oligodendroglioma: A Single-Center Cohort Study.",Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,2024,"IDH-mutant glioma is classified as oligodendroglioma or astrocytoma based on 1p19q-codeletion. Whether prognostic factors are similar between these tumor types is not well understood. Retrospective cohort study. Molecular characterization was performed with targeted next-generation sequencing. Tumor volumes were calculated using semiautomatic 3D segmentation on all pre- and post-operative MRI scans. Overall survival was assessed with the Cox-proportional hazards model. A total of 383 patients with newly diagnosed IDH-mutant glioma were followed up for a median of 7.2 years. Grades 3 and 4 patients had significantly lower Karnofsky performance, with tumors having more contrast enhancement. Patients also received more aggressive postsurgery treatment. Postoperative tumor volume is significantly and independently associated with survival (HR, per cm3 1.19; 95% CI, 1.03-1.39) in IDH-mutant glioma. A separate analysis of oligodendroglioma and astrocytoma showed a significant association of postoperative tumor volume in astrocytoma but not in oligodendroglioma. Higher age and histologic tumor grade were associated with worse survival in patients with oligodendroglioma but not with astrocytoma. Our data support an initial strategy of extensive resection in patients with oligodendroglioma and astrocytoma. Other important prognostic factors differ between these tumor types, urging researchers and clinicians to keep treating these tumors as separate entities.",1473
38987399,Radiomics analysis of dual-layer spectral-detector CT-derived iodine maps for predicting tumor deposits in colorectal cancer.,European radiology,2025,"To investigate the value of radiomics analysis of dual-layer spectral-detector computed tomography (DLSCT)-derived iodine maps for predicting tumor deposits (TDs) preoperatively in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC). A total of 264 pathologically confirmed CRC patients (TDs + (n = 80); TDs - (n = 184)) who underwent preoperative DLSCT from two hospitals were retrospectively enrolled, and divided into training (n = 124), testing (n = 54), and external validation cohort (n = 86). Conventional CT features and iodine concentration (IC) were analyzed and measured. Radiomics features were derived from venous phase iodine maps from DLSCT. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) was performed for feature selection. Finally, a support vector machine (SVM) algorithm was employed to develop clinical, radiomics, and combined models based on the most valuable clinical parameters and radiomics features. Area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), calibration curves, and decision curve analysis were used to evaluate the model's efficacy. The combined model incorporating the valuable clinical parameters and radiomics features demonstrated excellent performance in predicting TDs in CRC (AUCs of 0.926, 0.881, and 0.887 in the training, testing, and external validation cohorts, respectively), which outperformed the clinical model in the training cohort and external validation cohorts (AUC: 0.839 and 0.695; p: 0.003 and 0.014) and the radiomics model in two cohorts (AUC: 0.922 and 0.792; p: 0.014 and 0.035). Radiomics analysis of DLSCT-derived iodine maps showed excellent predictive efficiency for preoperatively diagnosing TDs in CRC, and could guide clinicians in making individualized treatment strategies. The radiomics model based on DLSCT iodine maps has the potential to aid in the accurate preoperative prediction of TDs in CRC patients, offering valuable guidance for clinical decision-making. Accurately predicting TDs in CRC patients preoperatively based on conventional CT features poses a challenge. The Radiomics model based on DLSCT iodine maps outperformed conventional CT in predicting TDs. The model combing DLSCT iodine maps radiomics features and conventional CT features performed excellently in predicting TDs.",2276
38985185,Deep learning in pulmonary nodule detection and segmentation: a systematic review.,European radiology,2025,"The accurate detection and precise segmentation of lung nodules on computed tomography are key prerequisites for early diagnosis and appropriate treatment of lung cancer. This study was designed to compare detection and segmentation methods for pulmonary nodules using deep-learning techniques to fill methodological gaps and biases in the existing literature. This study utilized a systematic review with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, searching PubMed, Embase, Web of Science Core Collection, and the Cochrane Library databases up to May 10, 2023. The Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2 criteria was used to assess the risk of bias and was adjusted with the Checklist for Artificial Intelligence in Medical Imaging. The study analyzed and extracted model performance, data sources, and task-focus information. After screening, we included nine studies meeting our inclusion criteria. These studies were published between 2019 and 2023 and predominantly used public datasets, with the Lung Image Database Consortium Image Collection and Image Database Resource Initiative and Lung Nodule Analysis 2016 being the most common. The studies focused on detection, segmentation, and other tasks, primarily utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks for model development. Performance evaluation covered multiple metrics, including sensitivity and the Dice coefficient. This study highlights the potential power of deep learning in lung nodule detection and segmentation. It underscores the importance of standardized data processing, code and data sharing, the value of external test datasets, and the need to balance model complexity and efficiency in future research. Deep learning demonstrates significant promise in autonomously detecting and segmenting pulmonary nodules. Future research should address methodological shortcomings and variability to enhance its clinical utility. Deep learning shows potential in the detection and segmentation of pulmonary nodules. There are methodological gaps and biases present in the existing literature. Factors such as external validation and transparency affect the clinical application.",2194
38985184,Non-contrast spectral CT vs chemical-shift MRI in discriminating lipid-poor adrenal lesions.,European radiology,2025,"To compare the diagnostic performance of conventional non-contrast CT, dual-energy spectral CT, and chemical-shift MRI (CS-MRI) in discriminating lipid-poor adenomas (> 10-HU on non-contrast CT) from non-adenomas. A total of 110 patients (69 men; 41 women; mean age 66.5 ± 13.4 years) with 80 lipid-poor adenomas and 30 non-adenomas who underwent non-contrast dual-layer spectral CT and CS-MRI were retrospectively identified. For each lesion, non-contrast attenuation on conventional 120-kVp images, ΔHU-index ([attenuation difference between virtual monoenergetic 140-keV and 40-keV images]/conventional attenuation × 100), and signal intensity index (SI-index) were quantified. Each parameter was compared between adenomas and non-adenomas using the Mann-Whitney U-test. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and sensitivity to achieve > 95% specificity for adenoma diagnosis were determined. Conventional non-contrast attenuation was lower in adenomas than in non-adenomas (22.4 ± 8.6 HU vs 32.8 ± 48.5 HU), whereas ΔHU-index (148.0 ± 103.2 vs 19.4 ± 25.8) and SI-index (41.6 ± 19.6 vs 4.2 ± 10.2) were higher in adenomas (all, p < 0.001). ΔHU-index showed superior performance to conventional non-contrast attenuation (AUC: 0.919 [95% CI: 0.852-0.963] vs 0.791 [95% CI: 0.703-0.863]; sensitivity: 75.0% [60/80] vs 27.5% [22/80], both p < 0.001), and near equivalent to SI-index (AUC: 0.952 [95% CI: 0.894-0.984], sensitivity 85.0% [68/80], both p > 0.05). Both the ΔHU-index and SI-index provided a sensitivity of 96.0% (48/50) for hypoattenuating adenomas (≤ 25 HU). For hyperattenuating (> 25 HU) adenomas, SI-index showed higher sensitivity than ΔHU-index (66.7% [20/30] vs 40.0% [12/30], p = 0.022). Non-contrast spectral CT and CS-MRI outperformed conventional non-contrast CT in distinguishing lipid-poor adenomas from non-adenomas. While CS-MRI demonstrated superior sensitivity for adenomas measuring > 25 HU, non-contrast spectral CT provided high discriminative values for adenomas measuring ≤ 25 HU. Spectral attenuation analysis improves the diagnostic performance of non-contrast CT in discriminating lipid-poor adrenal adenomas, potentially serving as an alternative to CS-MRI and obviating the necessity for additional diagnostic workup in indeterminate adrenal incidentalomas, particularly for lesions measuring ≤ 25 HU. Incidental adrenal lesion detection has increased as abdominal CT use has become more frequent. Non-contrast spectral CT and CS-MRI differentiated lipid-poor adenomas from non-adenomas better than conventional non-contrast CT. For lesions measuring ≤ 25 HU, spectral CT may obviate the need for additional evaluation.",2686
38981890,Specific brain MRI features of constitutional mismatch repair deficiency syndrome in children with high-grade gliomas.,European radiology,2024,"Children with constitutional mismatch repair deficiency (CMMRD) syndrome have an increased risk of high-grade gliomas (HGG), and brain imaging abnormalities. This study analyzes brain imaging features in CMMRD syndrome children versus those with HGG without CMMRD. Retrospective comparative analysis of brain imaging in 30 CMMRD children (20 boys, median age eight years, 22 with HGG), seven with Lynch syndrome (7 HGG), 39 with type 1 neurofibromatosis (NF1) (four with HGG) and 50 with HGG without MMR or NF1 pathogenic variant (""no-predisposition"" patients). HGG in CMMRD and Lynch patients were predominantly hemispheric (versus midline) compared to NF1 and no-predisposition patients (91% and 86%, vs 25% and 54%, p = 0.004). CMMRD-associated tumors often had ill-defined boundaries (p = 0.008). All CMMRD patients exhibited at least one developmental venous anomaly (DVA), versus 14%, 10%, and 6% of Lynch, NF1, and no-predisposition patients (p < 0.0001). Multiple DVAs were observed in 83% of CMMRD patients, one NF1 patient (3%), and never in other groups (p < 0.0001). Cavernomas were discovered in 21% of CMMRD patients, never in other groups (p = 0.01). NF1-like focal areas of high T2-FLAIR signal intensity (FASI) were more prevalent in CMMRD patients than in Lynch or no-predisposition patients (50%, vs 20% and 0%, respectively, p < 0.0001). Subcortical and ill-limited FASI, possibly involving the cortex, were specific to CMMRD (p < 0.0001) and did not evolve in 93% of patients (13/14). Diffuse hemispherically located HGG associated with multiple DVAs, cavernomas, and NF1-like or subcortical FASI strongly suggests CMMRD syndrome compared to children with HGG in other contexts. The radiologic suggestion of CMMRD syndrome when confronted with HGGs in children may prompt genetic testing. This can influence therapeutic plans. Therefore, imaging features could potentially be incorporated into CMMRD testing recommendations. Using imaging to detect CMMRD syndrome early may improve patient care. CMMRD features include: hemispheric HGG with multiple developmental venous anomalies and NF1-like or subcortical areas with high T2-FLAIR intensity. We propose novel imaging features to improve the identification of potential CMMRD patients.",2258
38981889,Prediction of tumor regression grade in far-advanced gastric cancer after preoperative immuno-chemotherapy using dual-energy CT-derived extracellular volume fraction.,European radiology,2025,"This study examines the effectiveness of dual-energy CT (DECT) delayed-phase extracellular volume (ECV) fraction in predicting tumor regression grade (TRG) in far-advanced gastric cancer (FAGC) patients receiving preoperative immuno-chemotherapy. A retrospective analysis was performed on far-advanced gastric adenocarcinoma patients treated with preoperative immuno-chemotherapy at our institution from August 2019 to March 2023. Patients were categorized based on their TRG into pathological complete response (pCR) and non-pCR groups. ECV was determined using the delayed-phase iodine maps. In addition, tumor iodine densities and standardized iodine ratios were meticulously analyzed using the triple-phase enhanced iodine maps. Univariate analysis with five-fold cross-validation and Spearman correlation determined DECT parameters and clinical indicators association with pCR. The predictive accuracy of these parameters for pCR was evaluated using a weighted logistic regression model with five-fold cross-validation. Of the 88 patients enrolled (mean age 60.8 ± 11.1 years, 63 males), 21 (23.9%) achieved pCR. Univariate analysis indicated ECV's significant role in differentiating between pCR and non-pCR groups (average p value = 0.021). In the logistic regression model, ECV independently predicted pCR with an average odds ratio of 0.911 (95% confidence interval, 0.798-0.994). The model, incorporating ECV, tumor area, and ID DECT-derived ECV fraction is a valuable predictor of TRG in FAGC patients undergoing preoperative immuno-chemotherapy. This study demonstrates that DECT-derived extracellular volume fraction is a reliable predictor for pathological complete response in far-advanced gastric cancer patients receiving preoperative immuno-chemotherapy, offering a noninvasive tool for identifying potential treatment beneficiaries.",1851

38980414,Dual-energy CT in differentiating benign gallbladder wall thickening from wall thickening type of gallbladder cancer.,European radiology,2025,"To evaluate the performance of dual-energy computed tomography (DECT) in differentiating non-acute benign from malignant gallbladder wall thickening (GBWT). This prospective study comprised consecutive adults with GBWT who underwent late arterial phase (LAP) and portal venous phase (PVP) DECT between January 2022 and May 2023. The final diagnosis was based on histopathology or 3-6 months follow-up imaging. DECT images in LAP and PVP were assessed independently by two radiologists. The demographic, qualitative, and quantitative parameters were compared between two groups Multivariate logistic regression was performed to determine the association between the aforementioned factors and malignant GBWT. Seventy-five patients (mean age 56 ± 12.8 years, 46 females) were included. Forty-two patients had benign, and 33 had malignant GBWT. In the overall group, female gender (p = 0.018), lymphadenopathy (p = 0.011), and omental nodules (p = 0.044) were significantly associated with malignant GBWT. None of the DECT features differed significantly between benign and malignant GBWT in overall group. In the xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis (XGC, n = 9) vs. gallbladder cancer (GBC) (n = 33) subgroup, mean attenuation value at 140 keV LAP VMI was significantly associated with malignant GBWT [p = 0.023, area under curve 0.759 (95%CI 0.599-0.919)]. DECT-generated quantitative parameters do not add value in differentiating non-acute benign from malignant GBWT. However, DECT may have a role in differentiating XGC from GBC in a selected subgroup of patients. Further, larger studies may be necessary to confirm these findings. In patients with non-acute gallbladder wall thickening in whom there is suspicion of xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis (XGC), DECT findings may allow differentiation of XGC from wall thickening type of gallbladder cancer. Differentiation of benign and malignant gallbladder wall thickening (GBWT) at CT is challenging. Quantitative dual energy CT (DECT) features do not provide additional value in differentiating benign and malignant GBWT. DECT may be helpful in a subgroup of patients to differentiate xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis from gallbladder cancer.",2195
38980413,Ultrasound-guided percutaneous radiofrequency ablation versus surgery for solitary T1N0M0 papillary thyroid carcinoma in the danger triangle.,European radiology,2024,"To compare the safety and efficiency of ultrasound-guided percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and surgical resection (SR) for thyroid papillary carcinoma (PTC) in the danger triangle area. The clinical data of 298 patients who underwent either percutaneous RFA or SR for PTC in the thyroid danger triangle at our hospital between January 2018 and April 2020 were retrospectively analyzed. Propensity score matching is employed to regulate for confounding factors. All patients undergoing ablation were treated using a strategy that combined sufficient paratracheal fluid isolation with a low-power, short electrode. Disease progression was analyzed in patients with T1N0M0 PTC (T1a and T1b) employed in Kaplan‒Meier curves. Treatment parameters and the rates of local recurrence, distant metastasis, and complications are recorded and compared. Of 182 eligible patients who were included, 91 were in the RFA (age 44.84 ± 13.19; 71 females; 77 T1a) and 91 were in the SR (age 47.36 ± 11.05; 68 females; 69 T1a). The average treatment time, length of hospital stays, blood loss volume, and scar length are substantially less in the RFA than in the SR. Major complications as well as postoperative permanent recurrent laryngeal nerve injury and postoperative transient parathyroid dysfunction occurred only in the SR, with a substantial distinction between the two groups (p < 0.05). There is no substantial distinction in the disease progression between RFA and SR treatment of T1N0M0 PTC. RFA is as effective as surgery for PTC in the danger triangle area in the short term, with faster recovery and fewer complications. Radiofrequency ablation has a clinical efficacy comparable to surgery in the treatment of papillary thyroid carcinoma in the danger triangle area in the short term with the advantages of faster recovery and fewer complications when compared with surgery. Use of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in the thyroid danger triangle is still controversial. RFA and surgery groups showed no difference in disease progressions, and no major complications occurred with RFA. Radiofrequency ablation offers a new option for papillary thyroid carcinoma patients in the danger triangle.",2197
38980412,Enhancement on CT for preoperative diagnosis of metastatic lymph nodes in thyroid cancer: a comparison across experience levels.,European radiology,2025,"To investigate the diagnostic performance and interobserver agreement of quantitative CT parameters indicating strong lymph node (LN) enhancement in differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC), comparing them with qualitative analysis by radiologists of varying experience. This study included 463 LNs from 399 patients with DTC. Three radiologists independently analyzed strong LN enhancement on CT. Qualitative analysis of strong enhancement was defined as LN cortex showing greater enhancement than adjacent muscles on the arterial phase. Quantitative analysis included the mean attenuation value (MAV) of LN on arterial phase (LN Interobserver agreement was excellent for all quantitative CT parameters (ICC, 0.83-0.94) and substantial for qualitative assessment (κ = 0.61). All CT parameters except for LN Quantitative assessment of LN enhancement on arterial phase CT showed higher interobserver agreement and AUC values than qualitative analysis by inexperienced radiologists, supporting the need for a standardized quantitative CT parameter-based model for determining strong LN enhancement. When assessing strong LN enhancement in DTC, quantitative CT parameters indicating strong enhancement can improve interobserver agreement, regardless of experience level. Therefore, the development of a standardized diagnostic model based on quantitative CT parameters might be necessary. Accurate preoperative assessment of LN metastasis in thyroid cancer is crucial. Quantitative CT parameters indicating strong LN enhancement demonstrated excellent interobserver agreement and good diagnostic performance. Quantitative assessment of contrast enhancement offers a more objective model for the identification of metastatic LNs.",1720
38967659,Diffusion-weighted imaging in addition to contrast-enhanced MRI in identifying complete response in HER2-positive breast cancer.,European radiology,2024,"The aim of this study is to investigate the added value of diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) to dynamic-contrast enhanced (DCE)-MRI to identify a pathological complete response (pCR) in patients with HER2-positive breast cancer and radiological complete response (rCR). This is a single-center observational study of 102 patients with stage I-III HER2-positive breast cancer and real-world documented rCR on DCE-MRI. Patients were treated between 2015 and 2019. Both 1.5 T/3.0 T single-shot diffusion-weighted echo-planar sequence were used. Post neoadjuvant systemic treatment (NST) diffusion-weighted images were reviewed by two readers for visual evaluation and ADCmean. Discordant cases were resolved in a consensus meeting. pCR of the breast (ypT0/is) was used to calculate the negative predictive value (NPV). Breast pCR-percentages were tested with Fisher's exact test. ADCmean and ∆ADCmean(%) for patients with and without pCR were compared using a Mann-Whitney U-test. The NPV for DWI added to DCE is 86% compared to 87% for DCE alone in hormone receptor (HR)-/HER2-positive and 67% compared to 64% in HR-positive/HER2-positive breast cancer. Twenty-seven of 39 non-rCR DWI cases were false positives. In HR-positive/HER2-positive breast cancer the NPV for DCE MRI differs between MRI field strength (1.5 T: 50% vs. 3 T: 81% [p = 0.02]). ADCmean at baseline, post-NST, and ∆ADCmean were similar between patients with and without pCR. DWI has no clinically relevant effect on the NPV of DCE alone to identify a pCR in early HER2-positive breast cancer. The added value of DWI in HR-positive/HER2-positive breast cancer should be further investigated taken MRI field strength into account. The residual signal on DWI after neoadjuvant systemic therapy in cases with early HER2-positive breast cancer and no residual pathologic enhancement on DCE-MRI breast should not (yet) be considered in assessing a complete radiologic response. Radiologic complete response is associated with a pathologic complete response (pCR) in HER2+ breast cancer but further improvement is warranted. No relevant increase in negative predictive value was observed when DWI was added to DCE. Residual signal on DW-images without pathologic enhancement on DCE-MRI, does not indicate a lower chance of pCR.",2287
38965093,Is MRI ready to replace biopsy during active surveillance?,European radiology,2024,"Active surveillance (AS) is a conservative management option recommended for patients diagnosed with low-risk prostate cancer (PCa) and selected cases with intermediate-risk PCa. The adoption of prostate MRI in the primary diagnostic setting has sparked interest in its application during AS. This review aims to examine the role and performance of multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) across the entire AS pathway, from initial stratification to follow-up, also relative to the utilization of the Prostate Cancer Radiological Estimation of Change in Sequential Evaluation (PRECISE) criteria. Given the high negative predictive value of mpMRI in detecting clinically significant PCa (csPCa), robust evidence supports its use in patient selection and risk stratification at the time of diagnosis or confirmatory biopsy. However, conflicting results have been observed when using MRI in evaluating disease progression during follow-up. Key areas requiring clarification include addressing the clinical significance of MRI-negative csPCa, optimizing MRI quality, determining the role of biparametric MRI (bpMRI) or mpMRI protocols, and integrating artificial intelligence (AI) for improved performance. CLINICAL RELEVANCE STATEMENT: MRI plays an essential role in the selection, stratification, and follow up of patients in active surveillance (AS) for prostate cancer. However, owing to existing limitations, it cannot fully replace biopsies in the context of AS. KEY POINTS: Multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) has become a crucial tool in active surveillance (AS) for prostate cancer (PCa). Conflicting results have been observed regarding multiparametric MRI efficacy in assessing disease progression. Standardizing MRI-guided protocols will be critical in addressing current limitations in active surveillance for prostate cancer.",1815
38959011,Pancreatic Cancer Surveillance and Survival of High-Risk Individuals.,JAMA oncology,2024,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a deadly disease with increasing incidence. The majority of PDACs are incurable at presentation, but population-based screening is not recommended. Surveillance of high-risk individuals for PDAC may lead to early detection, but the survival benefit is unproven. To compare the survival of patients with surveillance-detected PDAC with US national data. This comparative cohort study was conducted in multiple US academic medical centers participating in the Cancer of the Pancreas Screening program, which screens high-risk individuals with a familial or genetic predisposition for PDAC. The comparison cohort comprised patients with PDAC matched for age, sex, and year of diagnosis from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program. The Cancer of the Pancreas Screening program originated in 1998, and data collection was done through 2021. The data analysis was performed from April 29, 2022, through April 10, 2023. Endoscopic ultrasonography or magnetic resonance imaging performed annually and standard-of-care surgical and/or oncologic treatment. Stage of PDAC at diagnosis, overall survival (OS), and PDAC mortality were compared using descriptive statistics and conditional logistic regression, Cox proportional hazards regression, and competing risk regression models. Sensitivity analyses and adjustment for lead-time bias were also conducted. A total of 26 high-risk individuals (mean [SD] age at diagnosis, 65.8 [9.5] years; 15 female [57.7%]) with PDAC were compared with 1504 SEER control patients with PDAC (mean [SD] age at diagnosis, 66.8 [7.9] years; 771 female [51.3%]). The median primary tumor diameter of the 26 high-risk individuals was smaller than in the control patients (2.5 [range, 0.6-5.0] vs 3.6 [range, 0.2-8.0] cm, respectively; P < .001). The high-risk individuals were more likely to be diagnosed with a lower stage (stage I, 10 [38.5%]; stage II, 8 [30.8%]) than matched control patients (stage I, 155 [10.3%]; stage II, 377 [25.1%]; P < .001). The PDAC mortality rate at 5 years was lower for high-risk individuals than control patients (43% vs 86%; hazard ratio, 3.58; 95% CI, 2.01-6.39; P < .001), and high-risk individuals lived longer than matched control patients (median OS, 61.7 [range, 1.9-147.3] vs 8.0 [range, 1.0-131.0] months; 5-year OS rate, 50% [95% CI, 32%-80%] vs 9% [95% CI, 7%-11%]). These findings suggest that surveillance of high-risk individuals may lead to detection of smaller, lower-stage PDACs and improved survival.",2539

In this retrospective single-center study, two radiologists assessed the presence of RPG and morphologic features on wrist MRI. Radiopalmar complaints and scapholunate ligament (SLL) tears were evaluated. A total of 1053 wrists in 909 patients (mean age 43.4 ± 15.5 years, 602 females) were evaluated. All 308 RPG (Group 1; 308 patients, 29.2%) originated from the palmar capsule; 49 were unilocular, 95 oligolocular, and 164 multilocular; 745 wrists had no RPG (Group 2; 601 patients). One hundred and twenty-six RPG showed internal debris. The mean diameter was 8.5 ± 5.6 mm (cranio-caudal) (1.0-32.9 mm), 8.0 ± 4.1 mm (medio-lateral) (1.0-31.9 mm), and 3.7 ± 2.3 mm (dorso-palmar) (0.4-16.0 mm). 168 RPG showed direct contact with the radial vascular bundle, 24 with the flexor carpi radialis tendon, and 123 with the flexor pollicis longus tendon. In Group 1, significantly more patients showed partial (82/308) [group 2: 45/745, p < 0.001] or complete SLL tears (22/308) [group 2: 20/745, p < 0.001]. Of the patients with RPG, 15.3% presented with radiopalmar complaints. Only the dorso-palmar RPG diameter was positively correlated with radiopalmar complaints (for readers 1 and 2: r This study found RPG in 29% of patients, most of them asymptomatic. However, a dorso-palmar cyst diameter > 3 mm may be clinically significant.

38955845,Prostate cancer risk assessment and avoidance of prostate biopsies using fully automatic deep learning in prostate MRI: comparison to PI-RADS and integration with clinical data in nomograms.,European radiology,2024,"Risk calculators (RCs) improve patient selection for prostate biopsy with clinical/demographic information, recently with prostate MRI using the prostate imaging reporting and data system (PI-RADS). Fully-automated deep learning (DL) analyzes MRI data independently, and has been shown to be on par with clinical radiologists, but has yet to be incorporated into RCs. The goal of this study is to re-assess the diagnostic quality of RCs, the impact of replacing PI-RADS with DL predictions, and potential performance gains by adding DL besides PI-RADS. One thousand six hundred twenty-seven consecutive examinations from 2014 to 2021 were included in this retrospective single-center study, including 517 exams withheld for RC testing. Board-certified radiologists assessed PI-RADS during clinical routine, then systematic and MRI/Ultrasound-fusion biopsies provided histopathological ground truth for significant prostate cancer (sPC). nnUNet-based DL ensembles were trained on biparametric MRI predicting the presence of sPC lesions (UNet-probability) and a PI-RADS-analogous five-point scale (UNet-Likert). Previously published RCs were validated as is; with PI-RADS substituted by UNet-Likert (UNet-Likert-substituted RC); and with both UNet-probability and PI-RADS (UNet-probability-extended RC). Together with a newly fitted RC using clinical data, PI-RADS and UNet-probability, existing RCs were compared by receiver-operating characteristics, calibration, and decision-curve analysis. Diagnostic performance remained stable for UNet-Likert-substituted RCs. DL contained complementary diagnostic information to PI-RADS. The newly-fitted RC spared 49% [252/517] of biopsies while maintaining the negative predictive value (94%), compared to PI-RADS ≥ 4 cut-off which spared 37% [190/517] (p < 0.001). Incorporating DL as an independent diagnostic marker for RCs can improve patient stratification before biopsy, as there is complementary information in DL features and clinical PI-RADS assessment. For patients with positive prostate screening results, a comprehensive diagnostic workup, including prostate MRI, DL analysis, and individual classification using nomograms can identify patients with minimal prostate cancer risk, as they benefit less from the more invasive biopsy procedure. The current MRI-based nomograms result in many negative prostate biopsies. The addition of DL to nomograms with clinical data and PI-RADS improves patient stratification before biopsy. Fully automatic DL can be substituted for PI-RADS without sacrificing the quality of nomogram predictions. Prostate nomograms show cancer detection ability comparable to previous validation studies while being suitable for the addition of DL analysis.",2732

This IRB-approved, retrospective study included 119 observations from 77 adult patients (36 women, 41 men; median 64 years) who underwent liver CT or MRI from 2010 to 2023. All patients had histopathologic evidence of SLD without cirrhosis. Three board-certified abdominal radiologists blinded to tissue diagnosis and imaging follow-up assessed observations with LI-RADS. The positive predictive value (PPV), sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and inter-reader agreement were calculated. Seventy-five observations (63%) were benign and 44 (37%) were malignant. PPV for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was 0-0% for LR-1, 0-0% for LR-2, 0-7% for LR-3, 11-20% for LR-4, 75-88% for LR-5, 0-8% for LR-M, and 50-75% for LR-TIV. For LR-5 in identifying HCC, sensitivity was 79-83%, specificity was 91-97%, and accuracy was 89-92%. For composite categories of LR-5, LR-M, or LR-TIV in identifying malignancy, sensitivity was 86-89%, specificity was 85-96%, and accuracy was 86-93%. The most common false positives for LR-5 were hepatocellular adenomas. Only 59-65% of HCCs showed non-peripheral washout at CT versus 67-83% at MRI, though nearly all had an enhancing capsule. PPV and accuracy of LR-5 for HCC did not differ by modality. Inter-reader agreement for major features ranged from 0.667 to 0.830 and was 0.766 for the final category. Despite challenges such as the lower prevalence of non-peripheral washout at CT and overlapping imaging features between HCC and hepatocellular adenomas, LI-RADS may serve as an effective tool in assessing focal liver lesions in SLD. LI-RADS in non-cirrhotic steatotic liver disease can effectively diagnose hepatocellular carcinoma and malignancy at computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, thereby guiding clinical management decisions and expediting patient care pathways. Performance of LI-RADS is unknown in non-cirrhotic patients with steatotic liver disease. LI-RADS 5 category showed a high pooled specificity of 91-97% for hepatocellular carcinoma. LI-RADS can non-invasively risk stratify focal liver observations in non-cirrhotic patients with steatotic liver disease.",2327

PSMA positron emission tomography (PET) is superior to conventional imaging for the metastatic staging of prostate cancer per current research but studies of second-generation PSMA PET radioligands for locoregional staging are limited. To determine the accuracy of fluorine-18 PSMA-1007 PET/computed tomography (18F-PSMA-1007 PET/CT) compared to multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the primary locoregional staging of intermediate-risk and high-risk prostate cancers. The Next Generation Trial was a phase 2 prospective validating paired cohort study assessing the accuracy of 18F-PSMA-1007 PET/CT and MRI for locoregional staging of prostate cancer, with results of histopathologic examination as the reference standard comparator. Radiologists, nuclear medicine physicians, and pathologists were blinded to preoperative clinical, pathology, and imaging data. Patients underwent all imaging studies and radical prostatectomies at 2 tertiary care hospitals in Alberta, Canada. Eligible participants included men with intermediate-risk or high-risk prostate cancer who consented to radical prostatectomy. Participants who underwent radical prostatectomy were included in the final analysis. Patients were recruited between March 2022 and June 2023, and data analysis occurred between July 2023 and December 2023. All participants underwent both 18F-PSMA-1007 PET/CT and MRI within 2 weeks of one another and before radical prostatectomy. The primary outcome was the correct identification of the prostate cancer tumor stage by each imaging test. The secondary outcomes were correct identification of the dominant nodule, laterality, extracapsular extension, and seminal vesical invasion. Of 150 eligible men with prostate cancer, 134 patients ultimately underwent radical prostatectomy (mean [SD] age at prostatectomy, 62.0 [5.7] years). PSMA PET was superior to MRI for the accurate identification of the final pathological tumor stage (61 [45%] vs 38 [28%]; P = .003). PSMA PET was also superior to MRI for the correct identification of the dominant nodule (126 [94%] vs 112 [83%]; P = .01), laterality (86 [64%] vs 60 [44%]; P = .001), and extracapsular extension (100 [75%] vs 84 [63%]; P = .01), but not for seminal vesicle invasion (122 [91%] vs 115 [85%]; P = .07). In this phase 2 prospective validating paired cohort study, 18F-PSMA-1007 PET/CT was superior to MRI for the locoregional staging of prostate cancer. These findings support PSMA PET in the preoperative workflow of intermediate-risk and high-risk tumors.",2672

To bridge this gap, we established an international molecularly characterized database encompassing 934 medulloblastoma patients from thirteen centers across China and the United States. We demonstrate how image-based machine learning strategies have the potential to create an alternative pathway for non-invasive, presurgical, and low-cost molecular subgroup prediction in the clinical management of medulloblastoma. Our robust validation strategies-including cross-validation, external validation, and consecutive validation-demonstrate the model's efficacy as a generalizable molecular diagnosis classifier. The detailed analysis of MRI characteristics replenishes the understanding of medulloblastoma through a nuanced radiographic lens. Additionally, comparisons between East Asia and North America subsets highlight critical management implications. We made this comprehensive dataset, which includes MRI signatures, clinicopathological features, treatment variables, and survival data, publicly available to advance global medulloblastoma research.",1199
38937295,Prostate MRI and artificial intelligence during active surveillance: should we jump on the bandwagon?,European radiology,2024,"To review the components of past and present active surveillance (AS) protocols, provide an overview of the current studies employing artificial intelligence (AI) in AS of prostate cancer, discuss the current challenges of AI in AS, and offer recommendations for future research. Research studies on the topic of MRI-based AI were reviewed to summarize current possibilities and diagnostic accuracies for AI methods in the context of AS. Established guidelines were used to identify possibilities for future refinement using AI. Preliminary results show the role of AI in a range of diagnostic tasks in AS populations, including the localization, follow-up, and prognostication of prostate cancer. Current evidence is insufficient to support a shift to AI-based AS, with studies being limited by small dataset sizes, heterogeneous inclusion and outcome definitions, or lacking appropriate benchmarks. The AI-based integration of prostate MRI is a direction that promises substantial benefits for AS in the future, but evidence is currently insufficient to support implementation. Studies with standardized inclusion criteria and standardized progression definitions are needed to support this. The increasing inclusion of patients in AS protocols and the incorporation of MRI as a scheduled examination in AS protocols may help to alleviate these challenges in future studies. This manuscript provides an overview of available evidence for the integration of prostate MRI and AI in active surveillance, addressing its potential for clinical optimizations in the context of established guidelines, while highlighting the main challenges for implementation. Active surveillance is currently based on diagnostic tests such as PSA, biopsy, and imaging. Prostate MRI and AI demonstrate promising diagnostic accuracy across a variety of tasks, including the localization, follow-up and risk estimation in active surveillance cohorts. A transition to AI-based active surveillance is not currently realistic; larger studies using standardized inclusion criteria and outcomes are necessary to improve and validate existing evidence.",2123

The risk and benefit profiles of screening attendees are unknown; consequently, the impact and lost opportunity of ongoing lung cancer screening in the United States remains unclear. We estimated lung cancer death risk (using the Lung Cancer Death Risk Assessment Tool) and life gained from screening (using the Life Years Gained From Screening-Computed Tomography model) for individuals aged 50-79 years who ever-smoked in the US representative 2022 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. We compared lung cancer death risk and life gained among USPSTF-eligible individuals by screening status (self-reported screened vs not screened in past year) and estimated the number of lung cancer deaths averted and life-years gained under current screening levels and if everyone eligible was screened. USPSTF eligibility was 33.7% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 33.1% to 34.4%), of whom 17.9% (95% CI = 17.0% to 18.8%) self-reported screening. Screening uptake increased with increasing lung cancer death risk quintile (Q1 = 5.2%, 95% CI = 3.0% to 8.8%; Q5 = 21.8%, 95% CI = 20.3% to 23.3%) and life-gain from screening quintile (Q1 = 6.2%, 95% CI = 3.8% to 9.9%; Q5 = 20.8%, 95% CI = 19.5% to 22.2%).

Currently, screening averts 19 306 lung cancer deaths and gains 237 564 life-years; screening everyone eligible would additionally avert 56 956 lung cancer deaths and gain 751 850 life-years. Two-thirds of USPSTF lung-eligible women were up to date with breast cancer screening, but only 17.3% attended lung screening in the past year.

The presence of mucin on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) after neoadjuvant therapy leads to uncertainty about residual disease and appropriateness of a watch-and-wait strategy in patients with no evidence of disease on proctoscopy (endoscopic clinical complete response). MRI reports for locally advanced rectal cancer patients seen between July 2016 and January 2020 at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center were queried for presence of mucin in the tumor bed on MRI following neoadjuvant therapy. Clinicodemographic, pathologic, and outcome data were compiled and analyzed. Of 71 patients with mucin on posttreatment MRI, 20 had a clinical complete response, and 51 had abnormalities on endoscopy and/or physical exam. One patient with a clinical complete response opted out of watch-and-wait; thus, 19 (27%) patients entered watch-and-wait, and 52 (73%) patients were planned for surgery (non-watch-and-wait). Of the 19 watch-and-wait patients, 15 (79%) have had no local regrowth with median follow-up of 50 months (range = 29-76 months), while 4 (21%) experienced regrowth between 9 and 29 months after neoadjuvant therapy. Of the 52 patients who were planned to have surgery (non-watch-and-wait), 49 underwent resection while 3 developed metastatic disease that precluded curative-intent surgery. Of the 49 patients who underwent surgery, 5 (10%) had a pathologic complete response (including the patient with an endoscopic clinical complete response). The presence of mucin after neoadjuvant therapy for locally advanced rectal cancer does not preclude watch-and-wait management in otherwise appropriate candidates who achieve an endoscopic clinical complete response.",1860

To examine the false-negative probability using ultrasonography-measured endometrial thickness (ET) thresholds as triage for EC diagnosis among Black individuals and assess whether known risk factors of EC modify ET triage performance. This retrospective diagnostic study of merged abstracted electronic health record data and secondary administrative data (January 1, 2014, to December 31, 2020) from the Guidelines for Transvaginal Ultrasound in the Detection of Early Endometrial Cancer sample assessed Black individuals who underwent hysterectomy in a 10-hospital academic-affiliated health care system and affiliated outpatient practices. Data analysis was performed from January 31, 2023, to November 30, 2023. Pelvic ultrasonography within 24 months before hysterectomy. Ultrasonography performed before hysterectomy as well as demographic and clinical data on symptom presentation, endometrial characterization, and final EC diagnosis were abstracted. Endometrial thickness thresholds were examined for accuracy in ruling out EC diagnosis by using sensitivity, specificity, and negative predictive value. False-negative probability was defined as 1 - sensitivity. Accuracy measures were stratified by risk factors for EC and by factors hypothesized to influence ET measurement quality. A total of 1494 individuals with a uterus (median [IQR] age, 46.1 [41.1-54.0] years) comprised the sample, and 210 had EC. Fibroids (1167 [78.1%]), vaginal bleeding (1067 [71.4%]), and pelvic pain (857 [57.4%]) were the most common presenting diagnoses within 30 days of ultrasonography. Applying the less than 5-mm ET threshold, there was an 11.4% probability that someone with EC would be classified as not having EC (n = 24). At the 4-mm (cumulative) threshold, the probability was 9.5%, and at 3 mm, it was 3.8%. False-negative probability at the 5-mm threshold was similar among EC risk factor groups: postmenopausal bleeding (12.4%; 95% CI, 7.8%-18.5%), body mass index greater than 40 (9.3%; 95% CI, 3.1%-20.3%); and age 50 years or older (12.8%; 95% CI, 8.4%-18.5%). False-negative probability was also similar among those with fibroids on ultrasonography (11.8%; 95% CI, 6.9%-18.4%) but higher in the setting of reported partial ET visibility (26.1%; 95% CI, 10.2%-48.4%) and pelvic pain (14.5%; 95% CI, 7.7%-23.9%). These findings suggest that the transvaginal ultrasonography triage strategy is not reliable among Black adults at risk for EC. In the presence of postmenopausal bleeding, tissue sampling is strongly recommended.",2792

The predictive value of various body composition features and STM for determining CRC prognosis were compared. A novel index score based on the independent risk factors from Cox regression for CRC patients was established and evaluated for its usefulness. Multivariate Cox regression showed that low skeletal muscle radiodensity (SMD) (p = 0.020), low subcutaneous fat area (SFA) (p = 0.029), high carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) (p = 0.008), and high alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) (p = 0.039) were all independent prognostic factors for poor overall survival (OS). The multifactorial analysis indicated that high intermuscular fat area (IMFA) (p = 0.033) and high CEA (p = 0.009) were independent prognostic factors for poor disease-free survival (DFS). Based on these findings, two scoring systems for OS and DFS were established in the training datasets. CRC patients who scored higher on the new scoring systems had lower OS and DFS (both p < 0.001) as shown in the Kaplan-Meier survival curves in the training and validation datasets. In predicting the prognosis of CRC patients, SFA and SMD are superior to other body composition measurements. A scoring system based on body composition and STM can have prognostic value and clinical applicability. This scoring system, combining body composition and serum tumor markers, may help predict postoperative survival of CRC patients and help clinicians make well-informed decisions regarding the treatment of patients. Colorectal cancer prognosis can be related to body composition. High intermuscular fat area and CEA were independent prognostic factors for poor disease-free survival. This scoring system, based on body composition and tumor markers, can prognosticate for colorectal cancer patients.",2091

Twenty-seven consecutive patients with a resectable pancreatic, duodenal, or periampullary adenocarcinoma were enrolled in this prospective single expert centre study. Ferumoxtran-10-enhanced 3-T MRI was performed pre-surgery. LNs found on MRI were scored for suspicion of metastasis by two expert radiologists using a dedicated scoring system. Node-to-node matching from in vivo MRI to histopathology was performed using a post-operative ex vivo 7-T MRI of the resection specimen. Sensitivity and specificity were calculated using crosstabs. Eighteen out of 27 patients (median age 65 years, 11 men) were included in the final analysis (pre-surgery withdrawal n = 4, not resected because of unexpected metastases peroperatively n = 2, and excluded because of inadequate contrast-agent uptake n = 3). On MRI 453 LNs with a median size of 4.0 mm were detected, of which 58 (13%) were classified as suspicious. At histopathology 385 LNs with a median size of 5.0 mm were found, of which 45 (12%) were metastatic. For 55 LNs node-to-node matching was possible. Analysis of these 55 matched LNs, resulted in a sensitivity and specificity of 83% (95% CI: 36-100%) and 92% (95% CI: 80-98%), respectively. USPIO-enhanced MRI is a promising technique to preoperatively detect and localise LN metastases in patients with pancreatic, duodenal, or periampullary adenocarcinoma. Detection of (distant) LN metastases with USPIO-enhanced MRI could be used to determine a personalised treatment strategy that could involve neoadjuvant or palliative chemotherapy, guided resection of distant LNs, or targeted radiotherapy.

Utilizing quantitative T2 signal intensity and introducing a visual evaluation method based on T2 signal intensity heterogeneity, and compared MRI radiomic models for predicting radiotherapy response in pediatric patients with DIPG. We retrospectively included patients with brainstem gliomas aged ≤ 18 years admitted between July 2011 and March 2023. Applying Response Assessment in Pediatric Neuro-Oncology criteria, we categorized patients into PR and non-PR groups. For qualitative analysis, tumor heterogeneity vision was classified into four grades based on T2-weighted images. Quantitative analysis included the relative T2 signal intensity ratio (rT2SR), extra pons volume ratio, and tumor ring-enhancement volume. Radiomic features were extracted from T2-weighted and T1-enhanced images of volumes of interest. Univariate analysis was used to identify independent variables related to PR. Multivariate logistic regression was performed using significant variables (p < 0.05) from univariate analysis. Of 140 patients (training n = 109, and test n = 31), 64 (45.7%) achieved PR. The AUC of the predictive model with extrapontine volume ratio, rT2SRmax-min (rT2SR Combining T2-weighted quantification with qualitative and extrapontine volume ratios reliably predicted pediatric DIPG radiotherapy response. Combining T2-weighted quantification with qualitative and extrapontine volume ratios can accurately predict diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) radiotherapy response, which may facilitate personalized treatment and prognostic assessment for patients with DIPG. Early identification is crucial for radiotherapy response and risk stratification in diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma.

38904758,Dual-source dual-energy CT and deep learning for equivocal lymph nodes on CT images for thyroid cancer.,European radiology,2024,"This study investigated the diagnostic performance of dual-energy computed tomography (CT) and deep learning for the preoperative classification of equivocal lymph nodes (LNs) on CT images in thyroid cancer patients. In this prospective study, from October 2020 to March 2021, 375 patients with thyroid disease underwent thin-section dual-energy thyroid CT at a small field of view (FOV) and thyroid surgery. The data of 183 patients with 281 LNs were analyzed. The targeted LNs were negative or equivocal on small FOV CT images. Six deep-learning models were used to classify the LNs on conventional CT images. The performance of all models was compared with pathology reports. Of the 281 LNs, 65.5% had a short diameter of less than 4 mm. Multiple quantitative dual-energy CT parameters significantly differed between benign and malignant LNs. Multivariable logistic regression analyses showed that the best combination of parameters had an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.857, with excellent consistency and discrimination, and its diagnostic accuracy and sensitivity were 74.4% and 84.2%, respectively (p < 0.001). The visual geometry group 16 (VGG16) based model achieved the best accuracy (86%) and sensitivity (88%) in differentiating between benign and malignant LNs, with an AUC of 0.89. The VGG16 model based on small FOV CT images showed better diagnostic accuracy and sensitivity than the spectral parameter model. Our study presents a noninvasive and convenient imaging biomarker to predict malignant LNs without suspicious CT features in thyroid cancer patients. Our study presents a deep-learning-based model to predict malignant lymph nodes in thyroid cancer without suspicious features on conventional CT images, which shows better diagnostic accuracy and sensitivity than the regression model based on spectral parameters. Many cervical lymph nodes (LNs) do not express suspicious features on conventional computed tomography (CT). Dual-energy CT parameters can distinguish between benign and malignant LNs.

This study aimed to identify imaging characteristics differentiating FNH and HCA/HCC. This multicenter retrospective cohort study included patients with pathology-proven FNH or HCA/HCC, hyper-/isointense in the HBP of gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI between 2010 and 2020. Diagnostic performance of imaging characteristics for the differentiation between FNH and HCA/HCC were reported. Univariable analyses, multivariable logistic regression analyses, and classification and regression tree (CART) analyses were conducted. Sensitivity analyses evaluated imaging characteristics of B-catenin-activated HCA. In total, 124 patients (mean age 40 years, standard deviation 10 years, 108 female) with 128 hyper-/isointense lesions were included. Pathology diagnoses were FNH and HCA/HCC in 64 lesions (50%) and HCA/HCC in 64 lesions (50%). Imaging characteristics observed exclusively in HCA/HCC were raster and atoll fingerprint patterns in the HBP, sinusoidal dilatation on T2-w, hemosiderin, T1-w in-phase hyperintensity, venous washout, and nodule-in-nodule partification in the HBP and T2-w. Multivariable logistic regression and CART additionally found a T2-w scar indicating FNH, less than 50% fat, and a spherical contour indicating HCA/HCC. In our selected cohort, 14/48 (29%) of HCA were B-catenin activated, most (13/14) showed extensive hyper-/isointensity, and some had a T2-w scar (4/14, 29%). If the aforementioned characteristics typical for HCA/HCC are encountered in lesions extensively hyper- to isointense, further investigation may be warranted to exclude B-catenin-activated HCA. Hyper- or isointensity in the HBP of gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI is specific for FNH, but HCA/HCC can also exhibit this feature. Therefore, we described imaging patterns to differentiate these entities. FNH and HCA/HCC have similar HBP intensities but have different malignant potentials. Six imaging patterns exclusive to HCA/HCC were identified in this lesion population. These features in liver lesions hyper- to isointense in the HBP warrant further evaluation.",2271

We used a DL-based algorithm, AIRAProstate, to regrade initial prostate biopsies in 2 independent PCa active surveillance (AS) cohorts. In a cohort initially diagnosed with GG1 PCa using only systematic biopsies (n = 138), upgrading of the initial biopsy to ≥GG2 by AIRAProstate was associated with rapid or extreme grade reclassification on AS (odds ratio = 3.3, P = .04), whereas upgrading of the initial biopsy by contemporary uropathologist reviews was not associated with this outcome. In a contemporary validation cohort that underwent prostate magnetic resonance imaging before initial biopsy (n = 169), upgrading of the initial biopsy (all contemporary GG1 by uropathologist grading) by AIRAProstate was associated with grade reclassification on AS (hazard ratio = 1.7, P = .03).

To evaluate the performance of breast US tomography (UST) combined with full-field digital mammography (FFDM) compared with FFDM alone for breast cancer screening in women with dense breasts. This retrospective multireader multicase study included women with dense breasts who underwent FFDM and UST at 10 centers between August 2017 and October 2019 as part of a prospective case collection registry. All patients in the registry with cancer were included; patients with benign biopsy or negative follow-up imaging findings were randomly selected for inclusion. Thirty-two Mammography Quality Standards Act-qualified radiologists independently evaluated FFDM followed immediately by FFDM plus UST for suspicious findings and assigned a Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) category. The superiority of FFDM plus UST versus FFDM alone for cancer detection (assessed with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC]), BI-RADS 4 sensitivity, and BI-RADS 3 sensitivity and specificity were evaluated using the two-sided significance level of α = .05. Noninferiority of BI-RADS 4 specificity was evaluated at the one-sided significance level of α = .025 with a -10% margin.

Oncology,2024,"Artificial intelligence (AI) systems can potentially aid the diagnostic pathway of prostate cancer by alleviating the increasing workload, preventing overdiagnosis, and reducing the dependence on experienced radiologists. We aimed to investigate the performance of AI systems at detecting clinically significant prostate cancer on MRI in comparison with radiologists using the Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System version 2.1 (PI-RADS 2.1) and the standard of care in multidisciplinary routine practice at scale. In this international, paired, non-inferiority, confirmatory study, we trained and externally validated an AI system (developed within an international consortium) for detecting Gleason grade group 2 or greater cancers using a retrospective cohort of 10 207 MRI examinations from 9129 patients. Of these examinations, 9207 cases from three centres (11 sites) based in the Netherlands were used for training and tuning, and 1000 cases from four centres (12 sites) based in the Netherlands and Norway were used for testing. In parallel, we facilitated a multireader, multicase observer study with 62 radiologists (45 centres in 20 countries; median 7 [IQR 5-10] years of experience in reading prostate MRI) using PI-RADS (2.1) on 400 paired MRI examinations from the testing cohort. Primary endpoints were the sensitivity, specificity, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of the AI system in comparison with that of all readers using PI-RADS (2.1) and in comparison with that of the historical radiology readings made during multidisciplinary routine practice (ie, the standard of care with the aid of patient history and peer consultation). Histopathology and at least 3 years (median 5 [IQR 4-6] years) of follow-up were used to establish the reference standard. The statistical analysis plan was prespecified with a primary hypothesis of non-inferiority (considering a margin of 0·05) and a secondary hypothesis of superiority towards the AI system, if non-inferiority was confirmed. This study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT05489341. Of the 10 207 examinations included from Jan 1, 2012, through Dec 31, 2021, 2440 cases had histologically confirmed Gleason grade group 2 or greater prostate cancer. In the subset of 400 testing cases in which the AI system was compared with the radiologists participating in the reader study, the AI system showed a statistically superior and non-inferior AUROC of 0·91 (95% CI 0·87-0·94; p<0·0001), in comparison to the pool of 62 radiologists with an AUROC of 0·86 (0·83-0·89), with a lower boundary of the two-sided 95% Wald CI for the difference in AUROC of 0·02. At the mean PI-RADS 3 or greater operating point of all readers, the AI system detected 6·8% more cases with Gleason grade group 2 or greater cancers at the same specificity (57·7%, 95% CI 51·6-63·3), or 50·4% fewer false-positive results and 20·0% fewer cases with Gleason grade group 1 cancers at the same sensitivity (89·4%, 95% CI 85·3-92·9). In all 1000 testing cases where the AI system was compared with the radiology readings made during multidisciplinary practice, non-inferiority was not confirmed, as the AI system showed lower specificity (68·9% [95% CI 65·3-72·4] vs 69·0% [65·5-72·5]) at the same sensitivity (96·1%, 94·0-98·2) as the PI-RADS 3 or greater operating point. The lower boundary of the two-sided 95% Wald CI for the difference in specificity (-0·04) was greater than the non-inferiority margin (-0·05) and a p value below the significance threshold was reached (p<0·001). An AI system was superior to radiologists using PI-RADS (2.1), on average, at detecting clinically significant prostate cancer and comparable to the standard of care. Such a system shows the potential to be a supportive tool within a primary diagnostic setting, with several associated benefits for patients and radiologists. Prospective validation is needed to test clinical applicability of this system. Health~Holland and EU Horizon 2020.",4010

A total of 197 patients (146 in the training cohort, 51 in the validation cohort) from two centers were retrospectively collected. A total of 7338 radiomics features were extracted from T2-weighted, diffusion-weighted, T1-weighted, arterial phase, portal venous phase and delayed phase imaging. The optimal features were selected by the Mann-Whitney U test, Spearman's rank correlation test and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator method and used to construct the radiomic score (Rad-score). Conventional radiological and clinical features were also assessed. Multivariable logistic regression was used to construct a radiological model, a radiomic model and a fusion model. Nine optimal features were identified and used to build the Rad-score. The radiomic model based on the Rad-score achieved satisfactory results with AUCs of 0.905 and 0.930, sensitivities of 0.780 and 0.800, specificities of 0.906 and 0.952 and accuracies of 0.836 and 0.863 for the training and validation cohorts, respectively. The fusion model, incorporating CA19-9, tumor margins, pancreatic duct dilatation and the Rad-score, exhibited the best performance with AUCs of 0.977 and 0.941, sensitivities of 0.914 and 0.852, specificities of 0.954 and 0.950, and accuracies of 0.932 and 0.894 for the training and validation cohorts, respectively. The MR-based Rad-score is a novel image biomarker for discriminating small PDACs from PNETs. A fusion model combining radiomic, radiological and clinical features performed very well in differentially diagnosing these two tumors. A fusion model combining MR-based radiomic, radiological, and clinical features could help differentiate between small pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. Preoperatively differentiating small pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDACs) and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PNETs) is challenging. Multiparametric MRI-based Rad-score can be used for discriminating small PDACs from PNETs.

38867119,Performance of MRI for standardized lymph nodes assessment in breast cancer: are we ready for Node-RADS?,European radiology,2024,"The Node-RADS score was recently introduced to offer a standardized assessment of lymph node invasion (LNI). We tested its diagnostic performance in accurately predicting LNI in breast cancer (BC) patients with magnetic resonance imaging. The study also explores the consistency of the score across three readers. A retrospective study was conducted on BC patients who underwent preoperative breast contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging and lymph node dissection between January 2020 and January 2023. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value were calculated for different Node-RADS cut-off values. Pathologic results were considered the gold standard. The overall diagnostic performance was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic curves and the area under the curve (AUC). A logistic regression analysis was performed. Cohen's Kappa analysis was used for inter-reader agreement. The final population includes 192 patients and a total of 1134 lymph nodes analyzed (372 metastatic and 762 benign). Increasing the Node-RADS cut-off values, specificity and PPV rose from 71.4% to 100% and 76.7% to 100%, respectively, for Reader 1, 69.4% to 100% and 74.6% to 100% for Reader 2, and from 64.3% to 100% and 72% to 100% for Reader 3. Node-RADS > 2 could be considered the best cut-off value due to its balanced performance. Node-RADS exhibited a similar AUC for the three readers (0.97, 0.93, and 0.93). An excellent inter-reader agreement was found (Kappa values between 0.71 and 0.83). The Node-RADS score demonstrated moderate-to-high overall accuracy in identifying LNI in patients with BC, suggesting that the scoring system can aid in the identification of suspicious lymph nodes and facilitate appropriate treatment decisions. Node-RADS > 2 can be considered the best cut-off for discriminating malignant nodes, suggesting that the scoring system can effectively help identify suspicious lymph nodes by staging the disease and providing a global standardized language for clear communication. Axillary lymphadenopathies in breast cancer are crucial for determining the disease stage. Node-RADS was introduced to provide a standardized evaluation of breast cancer lymph nodes. RADS > 2 can be considered the best cut-off for discriminating malignant nodes.",2322

We aimed to describe the clinical and radiological characteristics of patients with a presumed pancreatic ACT diagnosis, reappraising the value of these published imaging criteria. Single-center retrospective study (2003-2021) of consecutive patients with a presumed diagnosis of ACT as suggested by the local expert multidisciplinary case review board. Patients without available imaging (CT or MRI) for review were excluded. Patients were classified into ""certain"" ACT (if ≥ 2 imaging criteria and no differential diagnosis) or ""uncertain"" ACT (if ≥ 1 imaging criteria and suggested differential diagnoses). Sixty-four patients (35 males, [55%]) were included. ACT was considered ""certain"" for 34 patients (53%) and ""uncertain"" for 30 patients (47%). The number of ACT criteria did not differ between groups, with 91.2% of patients with ≥ 3 ACT imaging criteria in the ""certain"" group vs 93.3% in the ""uncertain"" group (p = 0.88). In the ""uncertain"" group, the main suggested differentials were branch-duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (18/30 patients, 60%), calcifying chronic pancreatitis (8/30 patients, 27%), both (three patients, 10%) and serous cystadenoma (one patient, 3%). Calcifications were significantly more frequent in the ""uncertain"" group (89% vs 63% in the ""certain"" group, p = 0.02). Published ACT imaging criteria are frequently associated with features suggesting differential diagnoses. They appear insufficient to reach a final diagnosis in a subset of patients. ACT displays a heterogeneous morphological imaging presentation challenging the non-invasive diagnostic work-up. Physicians' and radiologists' awareness of this entity is important to better understand its natural history and improve non-invasive diagnostic criteria. The criteria to help diagnose ACT are frequently associated with features suggestive of differentials. The main alternatives suggested when ACT diagnosis was ""uncertain"" were branch-duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm and calcifying chronic pancreatitis. Published ACT diagnostic imaging criteria can be insufficient for a definite non-invasive diagnosis.",2217

Inter-observer reliability was assessed using kappa and intra-class correlation coefficients for cyst detection and volumetry, respectively. Disagreements concerning cyst detection were resolved by a consensus reading. Cyst size, relationship to extrinsic and scapholunate ligaments (SL), continuity of SL, minimum distance to the posterior interosseous nerve (PIN), cyst communication with joint, and anatomical classifications of cysts were analyzed. Correlation tests were performed to assess associations. Two-hundred ninety-five patients (mean age 39.6 +/- 15.6 (standard deviation), 161 males) were evaluated for detection of dorsal wrist cysts identified in 150/295. In this subgroup, the mean age was 38.7 years (15-75), the sex ratio of 0.6 (59% women), and the median volume cyst of 8.7 mm High-field MRI is the modality of choice for the detection, anatomical, and volumetric assessment of dorsal cysts. Preoperative assessment will be aided by the proposed revised anatomical classification. High-field MRI is the modality of choice for the anatomical study of dorsal ganglion cysts. It allows the radiologist to accurately describe the anatomical relationships, size, and visibility of the pedicle, essential information for the surgeon's preoperative assessment. Dorsal mucoid wrist ganglion is a condition for which prevalence remains to be determined. High-field MRI is a reproducible imaging modality for the detection and assessment of dorsal wrist cysts. High-field MRI has a key role in the preoperative management of dorsal mucoid cysts.",2049
38850308,Computed tomography characteristics of cN0 primary non-small cell lung cancer predict occult lymph node metastasis.,European radiology,2024,"Occult lymph node metastasis (OLNM) is frequently found in patients with resectable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), despite using diagnostic methods recommended by guidelines. To evaluate the risk of OLNM in NSCLC patients using the radiologic characteristics of the primary tumor on computed tomography (CT). We retrospectively reviewed clinicopathologic features of 2042 clinical T1-4N0 NSCLC patients undergoing curative intent pulmonary resection. Unique radiological features (i.e., air-bronchogram throughout the whole tumor, heterogeneous ground-glass opacity (GGO), mainly cystic appearance, endobronchial location), percentage of solid portion, and shape of tumor margin were analyzed via a stepwise approach. We used multivariable logistic regression to assess the relationship between OLNM and tumor characteristics. Compared with the other unique features, endobronchial tumors were associated with the highest risk of OLNM (OR = 3.9, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 2.29-6.62), and heterogeneous GGO and mainly cystic tumors were associated with a low risk of OLNM. For tumors without unique features, the percentage of the solid portion was measured, and solid tumors were associated with OLNM (OR = 2.49, 95% CI = 1.86-3.35). Among part-solid tumors with solid proportion > 50%, spiculated margin, and peri-tumoral GGO were associated with OLNM. The risk of OLNM could be assessed using radiologic characteristics on CT. This could allow us to adequately select optimal candidates for invasive nodal staging procedures (INSPs) and complete systematic lymph node dissection. These data may be helpful for clinicians to select appropriate candidates for INSPs and complete surgical systematic lymph node dissection in NSCLC patients. Lymph node metastasis status plays a key role in both prognostication and treatment planning. Solid tumors, particularly endobronchial tumors, were associated with occult lymph node metastasis (OLNM). The risk of OLNM can be assessed using radiologic characteristics acquired from CT images.",2041
38849662,ESR Essentials: characterisation and staging of adnexal masses with MRI and CT-practice recommendations by ESUR.,European radiology,2024,"Ovarian masses encompass various conditions, from benign to highly malignant, and imaging plays a vital role in their diagnosis and management. Ultrasound, particularly transvaginal ultrasound, is the foremost diagnostic method for adnexal masses. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is advised for more precise characterisation if ultrasound results are inconclusive. The ovarian-adnexal reporting and data system (O-RADS) MRI lexicon and scoring system provides a standardised method for describing, assessing, and categorising the risk of each ovarian mass. Determining a histological differential diagnosis of the mass may influence treatment decision-making and treatment planning. When ultrasound or MRI suggests the possibility of cancer, computed tomography (CT) is the preferred imaging technique for staging. It is essential to outline the extent of the malignancy, guide treatment decisions, and evaluate the feasibility of cytoreductive surgery. This article provides a comprehensive overview of the key imaging processes in evaluating and managing ovarian masses, from initial diagnosis to initial treatment. It also includes pertinent recommendations for properly performing and interpreting various imaging modalities. KEY POINTS: MRI is the modality of choice for indeterminate ovarian masses at ultrasound, and the O-RADS MRI lexicon and score enable unequivocal communication with clinicians. CT is the recommended modality for suspected ovarian masses to tailor treatment and surgery. Multidisciplinary meetings integrate information and help decide the most appropriate treatment for each patient.",1614
38848042,A Histopathologic Correlation Study Evaluating Glymphatic Function in Brain Tumors by Multiparametric MRI.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,2024,"This study aimed to elucidate the impact of brain tumors on cerebral edema and glymphatic drainage by leveraging advanced MRI techniques to explore the relationships among tumor characteristics, glymphatic function, and aquaporin-4 (AQP4) expression levels. In a prospective cohort from March 2022 to April 2023, patients with glioblastoma, brain metastases, and aggressive meningiomas, alongside age- and sex-matched healthy controls, underwent 3.0T MRI, including diffusion tensor imaging analysis along the perivascular space (DTI-ALPS) index and multiparametric MRI for quantitative brain mapping. Tumor and peritumor tissues were analyzed for AQP4 expression levels via immunofluorescence. Correlations among MRI parameters, glymphatic function (DTI-ALPS index), and AQP4 expression levels were statistically assessed. Among 84 patients (mean age: 55 ± 12 years; 38 males) and 59 controls (mean age: 54 ± 8 years; 23 males), patients with brain tumor exhibited significantly reduced glymphatic function (DTI-ALPS index: 2.315 vs. 2.879; P = 0.001) and increased cerebrospinal fluid volume (201.376 cm³ vs. 115.957 cm³; P = 0.001). A negative correlation was observed between tumor volume and the DTI-ALPS index (r: -0.715, P < 0.001), whereas AQP4 expression levels correlated positively with peritumoral brain edema volume (r: 0.989, P < 0.001) and negatively with proton density in peritumoral brain edema areas (ρ: -0.506, P < 0.001). Our findings highlight the interplay among tumor-induced compression, glymphatic dysfunction, and altered fluid dynamics, demonstrating the utility of DTI-ALPS and multiparametric MRI in understanding the pathophysiology of tumor-related cerebral edema. These insights provide a radiological foundation for further neuro-oncological investigations into the glymphatic system. See related commentary by Surov and Borggrefe, p. 4813.",1874
38843483,Automated Lugano Metabolic Response Assessment in ,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,2024,"Artificial intelligence can reduce the time used by physicians on radiological assessments. For  Here, we present a deep learning-based algorithm for fully automated treatment response assessments according to the Lugano 2014 classification. The proposed four-stage method, trained on a multicountry clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01287741) and tested in three independent multicenter and multicountry test sets on different non-Hodgkin lymphoma subtypes and different lines of treatment (ClinicalTrials.gov identifiers NCT02257567, NCT02500407; 20% holdout in ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT01287741), outputs the detected lesions at baseline and follow-up to enable focused radiologist review. The method's response assessment achieved high agreement with the adjudicated radiologic responses (eg, agreement for overall response assessment of 93%, 87%, and 85% in ClinicalTrials.gov identifiers NCT01287741, NCT02500407, and NCT02257567, respectively) similar to inter-radiologist agreement and was strongly prognostic of outcomes with a trend toward higher accuracy for death risk than adjudicated radiologic responses (hazard ratio for end of treatment by-model CMR of 0.123, 0.054, and 0.205 in ClinicalTrials.gov identifiers NCT01287741, NCT02500407, and NCT02257567, compared with, respectively, 0.226, 0.292, and 0.272 for CMR by the adjudicated responses). Furthermore, a radiologist review of the algorithm's assessments was conducted. The radiologist median review time was 1.38 minutes/assessment, and no statistically significant differences were observed in the level of agreement of the radiologist with the model's response compared with the level of agreement of the radiologist with the adjudicated responses. These results suggest that the proposed method can be incorporated into radiologic response assessment workflows in cancer imaging for significant time savings and with performance similar to trained medical experts.",1965
38842692,Natural language processing pipeline to extract prostate cancer-related information from clinical notes.,European radiology,2024,"To develop an automated pipeline for extracting prostate cancer-related information from clinical notes. This retrospective study included 23,225 patients who underwent prostate MRI between 2017 and 2022. Cancer risk factors (family history of cancer and digital rectal exam findings), pre-MRI prostate pathology, and treatment history of prostate cancer were extracted from free-text clinical notes in English as binary or multi-class classification tasks. Any sentence containing pre-defined keywords was extracted from clinical notes within one year before the MRI. After manually creating sentence-level datasets with ground truth, Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT)-based sentence-level models were fine-tuned using the extracted sentence as input and the category as output. The patient-level output was determined by compilation of multiple sentence-level outputs using tree-based models. Sentence-level classification performance was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) on 15% of the sentence-level dataset (sentence-level test set). The patient-level classification performance was evaluated on the patient-level test set created by radiologists by reviewing the clinical notes of 603 patients. Accuracy and sensitivity were compared between the pipeline and radiologists. Sentence-level AUCs were ≥ 0.94. The pipeline showed higher patient-level sensitivity for extracting cancer risk factors (e.g., family history of prostate cancer, 96.5% vs. 77.9%, p < 0.001), but lower accuracy in classifying pre-MRI prostate pathology (92.5% vs. 95.9%, p = 0.002) and treatment history of prostate cancer (95.5% vs. 97.7%, p = 0.03) than radiologists, respectively. The proposed pipeline showed promising performance, especially for extracting cancer risk factors from patient's clinical notes. The natural language processing pipeline showed a higher sensitivity for extracting prostate cancer risk factors than radiologists and may help efficiently gather relevant text information when interpreting prostate MRI. When interpreting prostate MRI, it is necessary to extract prostate cancer-related information from clinical notes. This pipeline extracted the presence of prostate cancer risk factors with higher sensitivity than radiologists. Natural language processing may help radiologists efficiently gather relevant prostate cancer-related text information.",2436
38836939,Multivariable prognostic modelling to improve prediction of colorectal cancer recurrence: the PROSPeCT trial.,European radiology,2024,"Improving prognostication to direct personalised therapy remains an unmet need. This study prospectively investigated promising CT, genetic, and immunohistochemical markers to improve the prediction of colorectal cancer recurrence. This multicentre trial (ISRCTN 95037515) recruited patients with primary colorectal cancer undergoing CT staging from 13 hospitals. Follow-up identified cancer recurrence and death. A baseline model for cancer recurrence at 3 years was developed from pre-specified clinicopathological variables (age, sex, tumour-node stage, tumour size, location, extramural venous invasion, and treatment). Then, CT perfusion (blood flow, blood volume, transit time and permeability), genetic (RAS, RAF, and DNA mismatch repair), and immunohistochemical markers of angiogenesis and hypoxia (CD105, vascular endothelial growth factor, glucose transporter protein, and hypoxia-inducible factor) were added to assess whether prediction improved over tumour-node staging alone as the main outcome measure. Three hundred twenty-six of 448 participants formed the final cohort (226 male; mean 66 ± 10 years. 227 (70%) had ≥ T3 stage cancers; 151 (46%) were node-positive; 81 (25%) developed subsequent recurrence. The sensitivity and specificity of staging alone for recurrence were 0.56 [95% CI: 0.44, 0.67] and 0.58 [0.51, 0.64], respectively. The baseline clinicopathologic model improved specificity (0.74 [0.68, 0.79], with equivalent sensitivity of 0.57 [0.45, 0.68] for high vs medium/low-risk participants. The addition of prespecified CT perfusion, genetic, and immunohistochemical markers did not improve prediction over and above the clinicopathologic model (sensitivity, 0.58-0.68; specificity, 0.75-0.76). A multivariable clinicopathological model outperformed staging in identifying patients at high risk of recurrence. Promising CT, genetic, and immunohistochemical markers investigated did not further improve prognostication in rigorous prospective evaluation. A prognostic model based on clinicopathological variables including age, sex, tumour-node stage, size, location, and extramural venous invasion better identifies colorectal cancer patients at high risk of recurrence for neoadjuvant/adjuvant therapy than stage alone. Identification of colorectal cancer patients at high risk of recurrence is an unmet need for treatment personalisation. This model for recurrence, incorporating many patient variables, had higher specificity than staging alone. Continued optimisation of risk stratification schema will help individualise treatment plans and follow-up schedules.",2601

All 21 patients with malignant PA masses were FDG-positive (100%), whereas 20 out of 21 patients were FAPI-positive (95.2%). All 12 patients with benign PA masses were both negative in FDG and FAPI PET. The mean maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) and target-to-background ratio (TBR) of FAPI and FDG in malignant PA masses were significantly higher than those of benign masses. Although there was no significant difference in SUVmax between FDG and FAPI in malignant PA masses (11.36 vs. 9.18, p = 0.175), the TBR (liver) and TBR (left ventricle) were more favorable for FAPI than for FDG (13.04 vs. 5.17, p < 0.001); (median: 7.75 vs. 2.75, p = 0.007).

38833638,Cardiac Dysfunction Among Breast Cancer Survivors: Role of Cardiotoxic Therapy and Cardiovascular Risk Factors.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,2025,"Cardiac dysfunction is the leading cause of mortality among 10-year breast cancer survivors. Limited information regarding long-term risks of cardiac dysfunction after cardiotoxic therapy (anthracyclines, trastuzumab/pertuzumab, radiation) has precluded development of surveillance guidelines for the survivors. Patients with breast cancer who completed cardiotoxic therapy underwent echocardiographic screening every 2 years. New-onset cardiac dysfunction was defined as left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) <50% after cardiotoxic therapy initiation and included early- and late-onset cardiac dysfunction. We evaluated 2,808 echocardiograms in 829 breast cancer survivors; the median age at breast cancer diagnosis was 54.2 years (range, 20.3-86.3); the median follow-up was 8.6 years (1.8-39.8); 39.7% received anthracyclines, 16% received trastuzumab/pertuzumab, 6.2% received both anthracyclines and trastuzumab/pertuzumab, and 38.1% received radiation alone. The cumulative incidence of cardiac dysfunction increased from 1.8% at 2 years to 15.3% at 15 years from cardiotoxic therapy initiation. Multivariable Cox regression analysis identified the following risk factors: non-Hispanic Black race (hazard ratio [HR], 2.15 [95% CI], 1.37 to 3.38), cardiotoxic therapies (anthracyclines: HR, 2.35 [95% CI, 1.25 to 4.4]; anthracyclines and trastuzumab/pertuzumab: HR, 3.92 [95% CI, 1.74 to 8.85]; reference: left breast radiation alone), selective estrogen receptor modulators (HR, 2.0 [95% CI, 1.2 to 3.33]), and precancer hypertension (HR, 3.16 [95% CI, 1.63 to 6.1]). Late-onset cardiac dysfunction was most prevalent among anthracycline- and radiation-exposed patients; early-onset cardiac dysfunction was most prevalent among patients exposed to anthracyclines and trastuzumab/pertuzumab; equal prevalence of both early- and late-onset cardiac dysfunction was observed in trastuzumab-/pertuzumab-exposed patients. Adjusted longitudinal analyses revealed an annual decline in LVEF by 0.29% ( These findings provide evidence to support echocardiographic surveillance for several years after cardiotoxic therapy and also suggest a need to examine the efficacy of management of cardiovascular risk factors to mitigate risk.",2231

38829583,T2-FLAIR Mismatch Sign Predicts DNA Methylation Subclass and CDKN2A/B Status in IDH-Mutant Astrocytomas.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,2024,"DNA methylation profiling stratifies isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)-mutant astrocytomas into methylation low- and high-grade groups. We investigated the utility of the T2-fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (T2-FLAIR) mismatch sign for predicting DNA methylation grade and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A/B (CDKN2A/B) homozygous deletion, a molecular biomarker for grade 4 IDH-mutant astrocytomas, according to the 2021 World Health Organization classification. Preoperative MRI scans of IDH-mutant astrocytomas subclassified by DNA methylation profiling (n = 71) were independently evaluated by two radiologists for the T2-FLAIR mismatch sign. The diagnostic utility of T2-FLAIR mismatch in predicting methylation grade, CDKN2A/B status, copy number variation, and survival was analyzed. The T2-FLAIR mismatch sign was present in 21 of 45 (46.7%) methylation low-grade and 1 of 26 (3.9%) methylation high-grade cases (P < 0.001), resulting in 96.2% specificity, 95.5% positive predictive value, and 51.0% negative predictive value for predicting low methylation grade. The T2-FLAIR mismatch sign was also significantly associated with intact CDKN2A/B status (P = 0.028) with 87.5% specificity, 86.4% positive predictive value, and 42.9% negative predictive value. Overall multivariable Cox analysis showed that retained CDKN2A/B status remained significant for progression-free survival (P = 0.01). Multivariable Cox analysis of the histologic grade 3 subset, which was nearly evenly divided by CDKN2A/B status, copy number variation, and methylation grade, showed trends toward significance for DNA methylation grade with overall survival (P = 0.045) and CDKN2A/B status with progression-free survival (P = 0.052). The T2-FLAIR mismatch sign is highly specific for low methylation grade and intact CDKN2A/B in IDH-mutant astrocytomas.",1841

The purpose of this study was to compare the diagnostic performance of LR-5 vs combined LR-4 and LR-5 (LR-4/5) for HCC diagnosis. MEDLINE and EMBASE databases through January 03, 2023 were searched for studies reporting the performance of LR-5 and combined LR-4/5 for HCC diagnosis, using CT/MRI LI-RADS version 2014, 2017, or 2018. A bivariate random-effects model was used to calculate the pooled per-observation diagnostic performance. Subgroup analysis was performed based on imaging modalities and type of MRI contrast material. Sixty-nine studies (15,108 observations, 9928 (65.7%) HCCs) were included. Compared to LR-5, combined LR-4/5 showed significantly higher pooled sensitivity (83.0% (95% CI [80.3-85.8%]) vs 65.7% (95% CI [62.4-69.1%]); p < 0.001), lower pooled specificity (75.0% (95% CI [70.5-79.6%]) vs 91.7% (95% CI [90.2-93.1%]); p < 0.001), lower pooled positive likelihood ratio (3.60 (95% CI [3.06-4.23]) vs 6.18 (95% CI [5.35-7.14]); p < 0.001), and lower pooled negative likelihood ratio (0.22 (95% CI [0.19-0.25]) vs 0.38 (95% CI [0.35-0.41]) vs; p < 0.001). Similar results were seen in all subgroups. Our meta-analysis showed that combining LR-4 and LR-5 would increase sensitivity but decrease specificity, positive likelihood ratio, and negative likelihood ratio. These findings may inform management guidelines and individualized management. This meta-analysis estimated the magnitude of changes in the sensitivity and specificity of imaging criteria when LI-RADS categories 4 and 5 were combined; these findings can inform management guidelines and individualized management. There is no single worldwide reporting system for liver imaging, partly due to regional needs.

38809123,Applications of Artificial Intelligence for Pediatric Cancer Imaging.,AJR. American journal of roentgenology,2024,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming the medical imaging of adult patients. However, its utilization in pediatric oncology imaging remains constrained, in part due to the inherent scarcity of data associated with childhood cancers. Pediatric cancers are rare, and imaging technologies are evolving rapidly, leading to insufficient data of a particular type to effectively train these algorithms. The small market size of pediatric patients compared with adult patients could also contribute to this challenge, as market size is a driver of commercialization. This review provides an overview of the current state of AI applications for pediatric cancer imaging, including applications for medical image acquisition, processing, reconstruction, segmentation, diagnosis, staging, and treatment response monitoring. Although current developments are promising, impediments due to the diverse anatomies of growing children and nonstandardized imaging protocols have led to limited clinical translation thus far. Opportunities include leveraging reconstruction algorithms to achieve accelerated low-dose imaging and automating the generation of metric-based staging and treatment monitoring scores. Transfer learning of adult-based AI models to pediatric cancers, multiinstitutional data sharing, and ethical data privacy practices for pediatric patients with rare cancers will be keys to unlocking the full potential of AI for clinical translation and improving outcomes for these young patients.",1500

38806802,Imaging classification of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma with histological large duct pattern.,European radiology,2024,"To investigate the imaging features of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) with histological large duct pattern. Our study included 37 patients (mean age, 66.5 years; 22 women) with surgically proven PDAC with histological large duct pattern, whose imaging features were classified into four types: Type I, solid mass; Type II, predominantly cystic mass with intracystic solid components; Type III, predominantly solid mass with intratumoral cysts; and Type IV, solid mass with peritumoral retention cysts or pseudocysts. Two radiologists independently analyzed both CT and MRI images for the morphological type, presence of abrupt main pancreatic duct (MPD) cutoff, adjacent vascular invasion, diffusion restriction, and reached consensus. On CT, 26 patients (70.3%) had Type I tumors, five (13.5%) had Type II, three (8.1%) had Type III, and three (8.1%) had Type IV. Among the 26 patients with Type I tumors on CT, 16 had tumors with multiple intratumoral cysts within the solid mass on MRI and were subsequently classified as Type III. Accordingly, 10 patients (27.0%) were classified as Type I, five (13.5%) as Type II, 19 (51.7%) as Type III, and three (8.1%) as Type IV on MRI. Of the 37 patients, 27 (73.0%) had an abrupt MPD cutoff, 15 (40.5%) had adjacent vascular invasion, and 25 (67.6%) had diffusion restriction on MRI. Predominantly solid pancreatic masses with small intratumoral cysts visualized on MRI may be a characteristic imaging finding of PDAC with histological large duct pattern, and differentiate it from conventional PDAC or other cystic pancreatic tumors. Radiologists should be familiar with the various imaging features of PDAC with histological large duct pattern and should be aware that it may mimic other solid or cystic tumors of the pancreas. Imaging features of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma with histological large duct pattern can be classified into four types. This pathology more frequently appears as a predominantly solid mass with intratumoral cysts on MRI than on CT. Adding MRI to CT may help identify pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma with histological large duct pattern.",2126

LI-RADS encompasses HCC surveillance with US; HCC diagnosis with CT, MRI, or contrast-enhanced US (CEUS); and treatment response assessment (TRA) with CT or MRI. LI-RADS was recently expanded to include CEUS TRA after nonradiation locoregional therapy or surgical resection. This report provides an overview of LI-RADS CEUS Nonradiation TRA v2024, including a lexicon of imaging findings, techniques, and imaging criteria for posttreatment tumor viability assessment. LI-RADS CEUS Nonradiation TRA v2024 takes into consideration differences in the CEUS appearance of viable tumor and posttreatment changes within and in close proximity to a treated lesion. Due to the high sensitivity of CEUS to vascular flow, posttreatment reactive changes commonly manifest as areas of abnormal perilesional enhancement without washout, especially in the first 3 months after treatment. To improve the accuracy of CEUS for nonradiation TRA, different diagnostic criteria are used to evaluate tumor viability within and outside of the treated lesion margin. Broader criteria for intralesional enhancement increase sensitivity for tumor viability detection. Stricter criteria for perilesional enhancement limit miscategorization of posttreatment reactive changes as viable tumor. Finally, the TRA algorithm reconciles intralesional and perilesional tumor viability assessment and assigns a single LI-RADS treatment response (LR-TR) category: LR-TR nonviable, LR-TR equivocal, or LR-TR viable.",1719
38787429,A predictive model using MRI and clinicopathologic features for breast cancer recurrence in young women treated with upfront surgery.,European radiology,2024,"To identify preoperative breast MR imaging and clinicopathological variables related to recurrence and develop a risk prediction model for recurrence in young women with breast cancer treated with upfront surgery. This retrospective study analyzed 438 consecutive women with breast cancer aged 35 years or younger between January 2007 and December 2016. Breast MR images before surgery were independently reviewed by breast radiologists blinded to patient outcomes. The clinicopathological data including patient demographics, clinical features, and tumor characteristics were reviewed. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to identify the independent factors associated with recurrence. The risk prediction model for recurrence was developed, and the discrimination and calibration abilities were assessed. Of 438 patients, 95 (21.7%) developed recurrence after a median follow-up of 65 months. Tumor size at MR imaging (HR = 1.158, p = 0.006), multifocal or multicentric disease (HR = 1.676, p = 0.017), and peritumoral edema on T2WI (HR = 2.166, p = 0.001) were identified as independent predictors of recurrence, while adjuvant endocrine therapy (HR = 0.624, p = 0.035) was inversely associated with recurrence. The prediction model showed good discrimination ability in predicting 5-year recurrence (C index, 0.707 in the development cohort; 0.686 in the validation cohort) and overall recurrence (C index, 0.699 in the development cohort; 0.678 in the validation cohort). The calibration plot demonstrated an excellent correlation (concordance correlation coefficient, 0.903). A prediction model based on breast MR imaging and clinicopathological features showed good discrimination to predict recurrence in young women with breast cancer treated with upfront surgery, which could contribute to individualized risk stratification. Our prediction model, incorporating preoperative breast MR imaging and clinicopathological features, predicts recurrence in young women with breast cancer undergoing upfront surgery, facilitating personalized risk stratification and informing tailored management strategies. Younger women with breast cancer have worse outcomes than those diagnosed at more typical ages. The described prediction model showed good discrimination performance in predicting 5-year and overall recurrence. Incorporating better risk stratification tools in this population may help improve outcomes.",2445
38787428,PI-QUAL version 2: an update of a standardised scoring system for the assessment of image quality of prostate MRI.,European radiology,2024,"Multiparametric MRI is the optimal primary investigation when prostate cancer is suspected, and its ability to rule in and rule out clinically significant disease relies on high-quality anatomical and functional images. Avenues for achieving consistent high-quality acquisitions include meticulous patient preparation, scanner setup, optimised pulse sequences, personnel training, and artificial intelligence systems. The impact of these interventions on the final images needs to be quantified. The prostate imaging quality (PI-QUAL) scoring system was the first standardised quantification method that demonstrated the potential for clinical benefit by relating image quality to cancer detection ability by MRI. We present the updated version of PI-QUAL (PI-QUAL v2) which applies to prostate MRI performed with or without intravenous contrast medium using a simplified 3-point scale focused on critical technical and qualitative image parameters. CLINICAL RELEVANCE STATEMENT: High image quality is crucial for prostate MRI, and the updated version of the PI-QUAL score (PI-QUAL v2) aims to address the limitations of version 1. It is now applicable to both multiparametric MRI and MRI without intravenous contrast medium. KEY POINTS: High-quality images are essential for prostate cancer diagnosis and management using MRI. PI-QUAL v2 simplifies image assessment and expands its applicability to prostate MRI without contrast medium. PI-QUAL v2 focuses on critical technical and qualitative image parameters and emphasises T2-WI and DWI.",1541
38780766,Performance of an ultra-fast deep-learning accelerated MRI screening protocol for prostate cancer compared to a standard multiparametric protocol.,European radiology,2024,"To establish and evaluate an ultra-fast MRI screening protocol for prostate cancer (PCa) in comparison to the standard multiparametric (mp) protocol, reducing scan time and maintaining adequate diagnostic performance. This prospective single-center study included consecutive biopsy-naïve patients with suspected PCa between December 2022 and March 2023. A PI-RADSv2.1 conform mpMRI protocol was acquired in a 3 T scanner (scan time: 25 min 45 sec). In addition, two deep-learning (DL) accelerated sequences (T2- and diffusion-weighted) were acquired, serving as a screening protocol (scan time: 3 min 28 sec). Two readers evaluated image quality and the probability of PCa regarding PI-RADSv2.1 scores in two sessions. The diagnostic performance of the screening protocol with mpMRI serving as the reference standard was derived. Inter- and intra-reader agreements were evaluated using weighted kappa statistics. We included 77 patients with 97 lesions (mean age: 66 years; SD: 7.7). Diagnostic performance of the screening protocol was excellent with a sensitivity and specificity of 100%/100% and 89%/98% (cut-off ≥ PI-RADS 4) for reader 1 (R1) and reader 2 (R2), respectively. Mean image quality was 3.96 (R1) and 4.35 (R2) for the standard protocol vs. 4.74 and 4.57 for the screening protocol (p < 0.05). Inter-reader agreement was moderate (κ: 0.55) for the screening protocol and substantial (κ: 0.61) for the multiparametric protocol. The ultra-fast screening protocol showed similar diagnostic performance and better imaging quality compared to the mpMRI in under 15% of scan time, improving efficacy and enabling the implementation of screening protocols in clinical routine. The ultra-fast protocol enables examinations without contrast administration, drastically reducing scan time to 3.5 min with similar diagnostic performance and better imaging quality. This facilitates patient-friendly, efficient examinations and addresses the conflict of increasing demand for examinations at currently exhausted capacities. Time-consuming MRI protocols are in conflict with an expected increase in examinations required for prostate cancer screening. An ultra-fast MRI protocol shows similar performance and better image quality compared to the standard protocol. Deep-learning acceleration facilitates efficient and patient-friendly examinations, thus improving prostate cancer screening capacity.",2403
38780764,ESR Essentials: using the right scoring system in prostate MRI-practice recommendations by ESUR.,European radiology,2024,"MRI has gained prominence in the diagnostic workup of prostate cancer (PCa) patients, with the Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) being widely used for cancer detection. Beyond PI-RADS, other MRI-based scoring tools have emerged to address broader aspects within the PCa domain. However, the multitude of available MRI-based grading systems has led to inconsistencies in their application within clinical workflows. The Prostate Cancer Radiological Estimation of Change in Sequential Evaluation (PRECISE) assesses the likelihood of clinically significant radiological changes of PCa during active surveillance, and the Prostate Imaging for Local Recurrence Reporting (PI-RR) scoring system evaluates the risk of local recurrence after whole-gland therapies with curative intent. Underlying any system is the requirement to assess image quality using the Prostate Imaging Quality Scoring System (PI-QUAL). This article offers practicing radiologists a comprehensive overview of currently available scoring systems with clinical evidence supporting their use for managing PCa patients to enhance consistency in interpretation and facilitate effective communication with referring clinicians. KEY POINTS: Assessing image quality is essential for all prostate MRI interpretations and the PI-QUAL score represents  the standardized tool for this purpose. Current urological clinical guidelines for prostate cancer diagnosis and localization recommend adhering to the PI-RADS recommendations. The PRECISE and PI-RR scoring systems can be used for assessing radiological changes of prostate cancer during active surveillance and the likelihood of local recurrence after radical treatments respectively.",1713
38777902,Standalone deep learning versus experts for diagnosis lung cancer on chest computed tomography: a systematic review.,European radiology,2024,"To compare the diagnostic performance of standalone deep learning (DL) algorithms and human experts in lung cancer detection on chest computed tomography (CT) scans. This study searched for studies on PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science from their inception until November 2023. We focused on adult lung cancer patients and compared the efficacy of DL algorithms and expert radiologists in disease diagnosis on CT scans. Quality assessment was performed using QUADAS-2, QUADAS-C, and CLAIM. Bivariate random-effects and subgroup analyses were performed for tasks (malignancy classification vs invasiveness classification), imaging modalities (CT vs low-dose CT [LDCT] vs high-resolution CT), study region, software used, and publication year. We included 20 studies on various aspects of lung cancer diagnosis on CT scans. Quantitatively, DL algorithms exhibited superior sensitivity (82%) and specificity (75%) compared to human experts (sensitivity 81%, specificity 69%). However, the difference in specificity was statistically significant, whereas the difference in sensitivity was not statistically significant. The DL algorithms' performance varied across different imaging modalities and tasks, demonstrating the need for tailored optimization of DL algorithms. Notably, DL algorithms matched experts in sensitivity on standard CT, surpassing them in specificity, but showed higher sensitivity with lower specificity on LDCT scans. DL algorithms demonstrated improved accuracy over human readers in malignancy and invasiveness classification on CT scans. However, their performance varies by imaging modality, underlining the importance of continued research to fully assess DL algorithms' diagnostic effectiveness in lung cancer. DL algorithms have the potential to refine lung cancer diagnosis on CT, matching human sensitivity and surpassing in specificity. These findings call for further DL optimization across imaging modalities, aiming to advance clinical diagnostics and patient outcomes. Lung cancer diagnosis by CT is challenging and can be improved with AI integration. DL shows higher accuracy in lung cancer detection on CT than human experts. Enhanced DL accuracy could lead to improved lung cancer diagnosis and outcomes.",2242
38775950,Pre-operative lung ablation prediction using deep learning.,European radiology,2024,"Microwave lung ablation (MWA) is a minimally invasive and inexpensive alternative cancer treatment for patients who are not candidates for surgery/radiotherapy. However, a major challenge for MWA is its relatively high tumor recurrence rates, due to incomplete treatment as a result of inaccurate planning. We introduce a patient-specific, deep-learning model to accurately predict post-treatment ablation zones to aid planning and enable effective treatments. Our IRB-approved retrospective study consisted of ablations with a single applicator/burn/vendor between 01/2015 and 01/2019. The input data included pre-procedure computerized tomography (CT), ablation power/time, and applicator position. The ground truth ablation zone was segmented from follow-up CT post-treatment. Novel deformable image registration optimized for ablation scans and an applicator-centric co-ordinate system for data analysis were applied. Our prediction model was based on the U-net architecture. The registrations were evaluated using target registration error (TRE) and predictions using Bland-Altman plots, Dice co-efficient, precision, and recall, compared against the applicator vendor's estimates. The data included 113 unique ablations from 72 patients (median age 57, interquartile range (IQR) (49-67); 41 women). We obtained a TRE ≤ 2 mm on 52 ablations. Our prediction had no bias from ground truth ablation volumes (p = 0.169) unlike the vendor's estimate (p < 0.001) and had smaller limits of agreement (p < 0.001). An 11% improvement was achieved in the Dice score. The ability to account for patient-specific in-vivo anatomical effects due to vessels, chest wall, heart, lung boundaries, and fissures was shown. We demonstrated a patient-specific deep-learning model to predict the ablation treatment effect prior to the procedure, with the potential for improved planning, achieving complete treatments, and reduce tumor recurrence. Our method addresses the current lack of reliable tools to estimate ablation extents, required for ensuring successful ablation treatments. The potential clinical implications include improved treatment planning, ensuring complete treatments, and reducing tumor recurrence.",2204

38771177,Patient Characteristics Impact Performance of AI Algorithm in Interpreting Negative Screening Digital Breast Tomosynthesis Studies.,Radiology,2024,"Background Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly used to manage radiologists' workloads. The impact of patient characteristics on AI performance has not been well studied. Purpose To understand the impact of patient characteristics (race and ethnicity, age, and breast density) on the performance of an AI algorithm interpreting negative screening digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) examinations. Materials and Methods This retrospective cohort study identified negative screening DBT examinations from an academic institution from January 1, 2016, to December 31, 2019. All examinations had 2 years of follow-up without a diagnosis of atypia or breast malignancy and were therefore considered true negatives. A subset of unique patients was randomly selected to provide a broad distribution of race and ethnicity. DBT studies in this final cohort were interpreted by a U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved AI algorithm, which generated case scores (malignancy certainty) and risk scores (1-year subsequent malignancy risk) for each mammogram. Positive examinations were classified based on vendor-provided thresholds for both scores. Multivariable logistic regression was used to understand relationships between the scores and patient characteristics. Results A total of 4855 patients (median age, 54 years [IQR, 46-63 years]) were included: 27% (1316 of 4855) White, 26% (1261 of 4855) Black, 28% (1351 of 4855) Asian, and 19% (927 of 4855) Hispanic patients. False-positive case scores were significantly more likely in Black patients (odds ratio [OR] = 1.5 [95% CI: 1.2, 1.8]) and less likely in Asian patients (OR = 0.7 [95% CI: 0.5, 0.9]) compared with White patients, and more likely in older patients (71-80 years; OR = 1.9 [95% CI: 1.5, 2.5]) and less likely in younger patients (41-50 years; OR = 0.6 [95% CI: 0.5, 0.7]) compared with patients aged 51-60 years. False-positive risk scores were more likely in Black patients (OR = 1.5 [95% CI: 1.0, 2.0]), patients aged 61-70 years (OR = 3.5 [95% CI: 2.4, 5.1]), and patients with extremely dense breasts (OR = 2.8 [95% CI: 1.3, 5.8]) compared with White patients, patients aged 51-60 years, and patients with fatty density breasts, respectively.

This retrospective study included 151 patients (mean age: 59.2 years; 126 men) with a single large HCC who underwent gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI and surgical resection between 2008 and 2020. Clinical variables, including tumor markers and MRI features (tumor size, tumor margin, and the proportion of hypovascular component on hepatic arterial phase (AP) (≥ 50% vs. < 50% tumor volume) were evaluated. Cox proportional hazards model analyzed overall survival (OS), recurrence-free survival (RFS), and associated factors. Among 151 HCCs, 37.8% and 62.2% HCCs were classified as ≥ 50% and < 50% AP hypovascular groups, respectively. The 5- and 10-year OS and RFS rates in all patients were 62.0%, 52.6% and 41.4%, 38.5%, respectively. Multivariable analysis revealed that ≥ 50% AP hypovascular group (hazard ratio [HR] 1.7, p = 0.048), tumor size (HR 1.1, p = 0.006), and alpha-fetoprotein ≥ 400 ng/mL (HR 2.6, p = 0.001) correlated with poorer OS. ≥ 50% AP hypovascular group (HR 1.9, p = 0.003), tumor size (HR 1.1, p = 0.023), and non-smooth tumor margin (HR 2.1, p = 0.009) were linked to poorer RFS. One-year RFS rates were lower in the ≥ 50% AP hypovascular group than in the < 50% AP hypovascular group (47.4% vs 66.9%, p = 0.019). MRI with ≥ 50% AP hypovascular component and larger tumor size were significant factors associated with poorer OS and RFS after resection of single large HCC (≥ 8 cm). These patients require careful multidisciplinary management to determine optimal treatment strategies. Preoperative MRI showing a ≥ 50% arterial phase hypovascular component and larger tumor size can predict worse outcomes after resection of single large hepatocellular carcinomas (≥ 8 cm), underscoring the need for tailored, multidisciplinary treatment strategies. MRI features offer insights into the postoperative prognosis for large hepatocellular carcinoma. Hypovascular component on arterial phase ≥ 50% and tumor size predicted poorer overall survival and recurrence-free survival. These findings can assist in prioritizing aggressive and multidisciplinary approaches for patients at risk for poor outcomes.",2276
38767658,Apparent diffusion coefficient and tissue stiffness are associated with different tumor microenvironment features of hepatocellular carcinoma.,European radiology,2024,"To investigate associations between tissue diffusion, stiffness, and different tumor microenvironment features in resected hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Seventy-two patients were prospectively included for preoperative magnetic resonance (MR) diffusion-weighted imaging and MR elastography examination. The mean apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and stiffness value were measured on the central three slices of the tumor and peri-tumor area. Cell density, tumor-stroma ratio (TSR), lymphocyte-rich HCC (LR-HCC), and CD8 + T cell infiltration were estimated in resected tumors. The interobserver agreement of MRI measurements and subjective pathological evaluation was assessed. Variables influencing ADC and stiffness were screened with univariate analyses, and then identified with multivariable linear regression. The potential relationship between explored imaging biomarkers and histopathological features was assessed with linear regression after adjustment for other influencing factors. Seventy-two patients (male/female: 59/13, mean age: 56 ± 10.2 years) were included for analysis. Inter-reader agreement was good or excellent regarding MRI measurements and histopathological evaluation. No correlation between tumor ADC and tumor stiffness was found. Multivariable linear regression confirmed that cell density was the only factor associated with tumor ADC (Estimate = -0.03, p = 0.006), and tumor-stroma ratio was the only factor associated with tumor stiffness (Estimate = -0.18, p = 0.03). After adjustment for fibrosis stage (Estimate = 0.43, p < 0.001) and age (Estimate = 0.04, p < 0.001) in the multivariate linear regression, intra-tumoral CD8 + T cell infiltration remained a significant factor associated with peri-tumor stiffness (Estimate = 0.63, p = 0.02). Tumor ADC surpasses tumor stiffness as a biomarker of cellularity. Tumor stiffness is associated with tumor-stroma ratio and peri-tumor stiffness might be an imaging biomarker of intra-tumoral immune microenvironment. Tissue stiffness could potentially serve as an imaging biomarker of the intra-tumoral immune microenvironment of hepatocellular carcinoma and aid in patient selection for immunotherapy. Apparent diffusion coefficient reflects cellularity of hepatocellular carcinoma. Tumor stiffness reflects tumor-stroma ratio of hepatocellular carcinoma and is associated with tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. Tumor and peri-tumor stiffness might serve as imaging biomarkers of intra-tumoral immune microenvironment.",2503
38759082,Allysine-Targeted Molecular MRI Enables Early Prediction of Chemotherapy Response in Pancreatic Cancer.,Cancer research,2024,"Neoadjuvant therapy is routinely used in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), but not all tumors respond to this treatment. Current clinical imaging techniques are not able to precisely evaluate and predict the response to neoadjuvant therapies over several weeks. A strong fibrotic reaction is a hallmark of a positive response, and during fibrogenesis, allysine residues are formed on collagen proteins by the action of lysyl oxidases. Here, we report the application of an allysine-targeted molecular MRI probe, MnL3, to provide an early, noninvasive assessment of treatment response in PDAC. Allysine increased 2- to 3-fold after one dose of neoadjuvant therapy with FOLFIRINOX in sensitive human PDAC xenografts in mice. Molecular MRI with MnL3 could specifically detect and quantify fibrogenesis in PDAC xenografts. Comparing the MnL3 signal before and 3 days after one dose of FOLFIRINOX predicted subsequent treatment response. The MnL3 tumor signal increased by 70% from day 0 to day 3 in mice that responded to subsequent doses of FOLFIRINOX, whereas no signal increase was observed in FOLFIRINOX-resistant tumors. This study indicates the promise of allysine-targeted molecular MRI as a noninvasive tool to predict chemotherapy outcomes. Significance: Allysine-targeted molecular MRI can quantify fibrogenesis in pancreatic tumors and predict response to chemotherapy, which could guide rapid clinical management decisions by differentiating responders from nonresponders after treatment initiation.",1514

Infants (≤ 1 year old) who were diagnosed with CBA or CC type I/IV from January 2010 to July 2023 were retrospectively reviewed. Imaging characteristics on MR were compared between the CBA and CC groups. Binary logistic regression and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) were analyzed for the identification of CBA. Sixty-three patients with CBA (median age, 30 days) and 172 patients with CC (median age, 60 days) were included. Gallbladder (GB) wall thickness (cutoff, 1.2 mm) showed 98.4% sensitivity and 100% specificity (AUC, 0.998). MR-triangular cord thickness (MR-TCT) (cutoff, 4.1 mm) showed 100% sensitivity and 95.9% specificity (AUC, 0.986). The bile duct loop visualization showed 96.8% sensitivity and 100% specificity (AUC, 0.984). Proximal bile duct (PBD) diameter (cutoff, 1.3 mm) showed 92.1% sensitivity and 95.3% specificity (AUC, 0.977). Cyst wall thickness (cutoff, 1 mm) showed 77.8% sensitivity and 95.3% specificity (AUC, 0.942).

This retrospective study included 277 PDAC patients who underwent multi-phase contrast-enhanced (CE) MRI and whole-slide imaging (WSI) from three centers (2015-2021). SER is defined as (SI The internal dataset comprised 159 patients, which was further divided into training, validation, and internal test datasets (n = 60, 41, and 58, respectively). Sixty-five and 53 patients were included in two external test datasets. Excluding lumen, SER demonstrated significant correlations with stroma (r = 0.29-0.74, all p < 0.001) and epithelium (r = -0.23 to -0.71, all p < 0.001) across a wide post-injection time window (range, 25-300 s). Bland-Altman analysis revealed a small bias between SER and QHA for quantifying stroma/epithelium in individual training, validation (all within ± 2%), and three test datasets (all within ± 4%). Moreover, SER-predicted low stromal proportion was independently associated with worse OS (HR = 1.84 (1.17-2.91), p = 0.009) in training and validation datasets, which remained significant across three combined test datasets (HR = 1.73 (1.25-2.41), p = 0.001). SER of multi-phase CE-MRI allows for tissue characterization and prognosis stratification in PDAC. The signal enhancement ratio of multi-phase CE-MRI can serve as a novel imaging biomarker for characterizing tissue composition and holds the potential for improving patient stratification and therapy in PDAC. Imaging biomarkers are needed to better characterize tumor tissue in pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Signal enhancement ratio (SER)-predicted stromal/epithelial proportion showed good agreement with histopathology measurements across three distinct centers. Signal enhancement ratio (SER)-predicted stromal proportion was demonstrated to be an independent prognostic factor for OS in PDAC.",1999
38742973,The Future Role of Abdominal US in Hepatocellular Carcinoma Surveillance.,Radiology,2024,"Abdominal US is currently the best-validated surveillance strategy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in at-risk patients. It is the only modality shown to have completed all five phases of validation and can achieve high sensitivity and specificity for HCC detection, especially when conducted by expert sonographers in high-volume centers. However, US also has limitations, including operator dependency and varying sensitivity in clinical practice. Further, the sensitivity of US for early-stage HCC detection is lower in patients with obesity or nonviral liver disease, increasingly common populations undergoing surveillance. Imaging-based and blood-based surveillance strategies, including abbreviated MRI and biomarker panels, may overcome some limitations of US-based surveillance. Both strategies have promising test performance in phase II and phase III biomarker studies and are undergoing prospective validation. Considering the variation in HCC risk and test performance between patients, there will likely be a shift away from a one-size-fits-all approach and toward precision screening, in which the ""best"" test is selected based on individual patient characteristics. In this upcoming era of precision HCC screening among patients with cirrhosis, US will likely continue to have an important, albeit reduced, surveillance role.",1343

38724768,Longitudinal ultrasound-based AI model predicts axillary lymph node response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer: a multicenter study.,European radiology,2024,"Developing a deep learning radiomics model from longitudinal breast ultrasound and sonographer's axillary ultrasound diagnosis for predicting axillary lymph node (ALN) response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in breast cancer. Breast cancer patients undergoing NAC followed by surgery were recruited from three centers between November 2016 and December 2022. We collected ultrasound images for extracting tumor-derived radiomics and deep learning features, selecting quantitative features through various methods. Two machine learning models based on random forest were developed using pre-NAC and post-NAC features. A support vector machine integrated these data into a fusion model, evaluated via the area under the curve (AUC), decision curve analysis, and calibration curves. We compared the fusion model's performance against sonographer's diagnosis from pre-NAC and post-NAC axillary ultrasonography, referencing histological outcomes from sentinel lymph node biopsy or axillary lymph node dissection. In the validation cohort, the fusion model outperformed both pre-NAC (AUC: 0.899 vs. 0.786, p < 0.001) and post-NAC models (AUC: 0.899 vs. 0.853, p = 0.014), as well as the sonographer's diagnosis of ALN status on pre-NAC and post-NAC axillary ultrasonography (AUC: 0.899 vs. 0.719, p < 0.001). Decision curve analysis revealed patient benefits from the fusion model across threshold probabilities from 0.02 to 0.98. The model also enhanced sonographer's diagnostic ability, increasing accuracy from 71.9% to 79.2%. The deep learning radiomics model accurately predicted the ALN response to NAC in breast cancer. Furthermore, the model will assist sonographers to improve their diagnostic ability on ALN status before surgery. Our AI model based on pre- and post-neoadjuvant chemotherapy ultrasound can accurately predict axillary lymph node metastasis and assist sonographer's axillary diagnosis. Axillary lymph node metastasis status affects the choice of surgical treatment, and currently relies on subjective ultrasound. Our AI model outperformed sonographer's visual diagnosis on axillary ultrasound. Our deep learning radiomics model can improve sonographers' diagnosis and might assist in surgical decision-making.",2232
38724765,Assessing deep learning reconstruction for faster prostate MRI: visual vs. diagnostic performance metrics.,European radiology,2024,"Deep learning (DL) MRI reconstruction enables fast scan acquisition with good visual quality, but the diagnostic impact is often not assessed because of large reader study requirements. This study used existing diagnostic DL to assess the diagnostic quality of reconstructed images. A retrospective multisite study of 1535 patients assessed biparametric prostate MRI between 2016 and 2020. Likely clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa) lesions (PI-RADS  DLRecon improved visual quality at 4- and 8-fold (R4, R8) subsampling rates, with SSIM (range: -1 to 1) improved to 0.78 ± 0.02 (p < 0.001) and 0.67 ± 0.03 (p < 0.001) from 0.68 ± 0.03 and 0.51 ± 0.03, respectively. However, diagnostic performance at R4 showed a pAUC FROC of 1.33 (CI 1.28-1.39) for DL and 1.29 (CI 1.23-1.35) for naive reconstructions, both significantly lower than fully sampled pAUC of 1.58 (DL: p = 0.024, naïve: p = 0.02). Similar trends were noted for R8. DL reconstruction produces visually appealing images but may reduce diagnostic accuracy. Incorporating diagnostic AI into the assessment framework offers a clinically relevant metric essential for adopting reconstruction models into clinical practice. In clinical settings, caution is warranted when using DL reconstruction for MRI scans. While it recovered visual quality, it failed to match the prostate cancer detection rates observed in scans not subjected to acceleration and DL reconstruction.",1440

38713025,MRI Scoring Systems for Predicting Isocitrate Dehydrogenase Mutation and Chromosome 1p/19q Codeletion in Adult-type Diffuse Glioma Lacking Contrast Enhancement.,Radiology,2024,"Background According to 2021 World Health Organization criteria, adult-type diffuse gliomas include glioblastoma, isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)-wildtype; oligodendroglioma, IDH-mutant and 1p/19q-codeleted; and astrocytoma, IDH-mutant, even when contrast enhancement is lacking. Purpose To develop and validate simple scoring systems for predicting IDH and subsequent 1p/19q codeletion status in gliomas without contrast enhancement using standard clinical MRI sequences. Materials and Methods This retrospective study included adult-type diffuse gliomas lacking contrast at contrast-enhanced MRI from two tertiary referral hospitals between January 2012 and April 2022 with diagnoses confirmed at pathology. IDH status was predicted primarily by using T2-fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) mismatch sign, followed by 1p/19q codeletion prediction. A visual rating of MRI features, apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) ratio, and relative cerebral blood volume was measured. Scoring systems were developed through univariable and multivariable logistic regressions and underwent calibration and discrimination, including internal and external validation. Results For the internal validation cohort, 237 patients were included (mean age, 44.4 years ± 14.4 [SD]; 136 male patients; 193 patients in IDH prediction and 163 patients in 1p/19q prediction). For the external validation cohort, 35 patients were included (46.1 years ± 15.3; 20 male patients; 28 patients in IDH prediction and 24 patients in 1p/19q prediction). The T2-FLAIR mismatch sign demonstrated 100% specificity and 100% positive predictive value for IDH mutation. IDH status prediction scoring system for tumors without mismatch sign included age, ADC ratio, and morphologic characteristics, whereas 1p/19q codeletion prediction for IDH-mutant gliomas included ADC ratio, cortical involvement, and mismatch sign. For IDH status and 1p/19q codeletion prediction, bootstrap-corrected areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve were 0.86 (95% CI: 0.81, 0.90) and 0.73 (95% CI: 0.65, 0.81), respectively, whereas at external validation they were 0.99 (95% CI: 0.98, 1.0) and 0.88 (95% CI: 0.63, 1.0). Conclusion The T2-FLAIR mismatch sign and scoring systems using standard clinical MRI predicted IDH and 1p/19q codeletion status in gliomas lacking contrast enhancement. © RSNA, 2024 ",2367
38713024,Evaluation of a Cascaded Deep Learning-based Algorithm for Prostate Lesion Detection at Biparametric MRI.,Radiology,2024,"Background Multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) improves prostate cancer (PCa) detection compared with systematic biopsy, but its interpretation is prone to interreader variation, which results in performance inconsistency. Artificial intelligence (AI) models can assist in mpMRI interpretation, but large training data sets and extensive model testing are required. Purpose To evaluate a biparametric MRI AI algorithm for intraprostatic lesion detection and segmentation and to compare its performance with radiologist readings and biopsy results. Materials and Methods This secondary analysis of a prospective registry included consecutive patients with suspected or known PCa who underwent mpMRI, US-guided systematic biopsy, or combined systematic and MRI/US fusion-guided biopsy between April 2019 and September 2022. All lesions were prospectively evaluated using Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System version 2.1.

We now report the results of the second question in the same study addressing the impact of adding neck ultrasound to physical examination during follow-up on outcomes. Patients with lateralized T1/T2 oral squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) were randomized to END or TND and to follow-up with physical-examination plus neck ultrasound (PE+US) versus physical-examination (PE). The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS). Between January 2004 and June 2014, 596 patients were enrolled. This is an intention to treat analysis of 592 analysable patients, of whom 295 were allocated to PE+US and 297 to PE with a median follow-up of 77.47 months (interquartile range (IQR) 54.51-126.48). There was no significant difference (unadjusted hazard ratio [HR], 0.92, 95% CI, 0.71-1.20, p = 0.54) in 5-year OS between PE+US (70.8%, 95% CI, 65.51-76.09) and PE (67.3%, 95% CI, 61.81-72.79). Among 131 patients with neck node relapse as the first event, the median time to relapse detection was 4.85 (IQR 2.33-9.60) and 7.62 (IQR 3.22-9.86) months in PE+US and PE arms, respectively. The N stage in the PE+US arm was N1 33.8%, N2a 7.4%, N2b/c 44.1% and N3 14.7% while in PE was N1 28.6%, N2a 9.5%, N2b/c 39.7%, N3 20.6% and unknown 1.6%.

The ongoing prospective Tomosynthesis or Contrast-Enhanced Mammography, or TOCEM, trial includes three annual screenings with both DBT and contrast-enhanced mammography (CEM). Purpose To perform interim assessment of cancer yield, stage, and recall rate when CEM is added to DBT in women with PHBC. Materials and Methods From October 2019 to December 2022, two radiologists interpreted both examinations: Observer 1 reviewed DBT first and then CEM, and observer 2 reviewed CEM first and then DBT. Effects of adding CEM to DBT on incremental cancer detection rate (ICDR), cancer type and node status, recall rate, and other performance characteristics of the primary radiologist decisions were assessed.

Purpose To evaluate the agreement between human readers and LLMs for Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) categories assigned based on breast imaging reports written in three languages and to assess the impact of discordant category assignments on clinical management. Materials and Methods This retrospective study included reports for women who underwent MRI, mammography, and/or US for breast cancer screening or diagnostic purposes at three referral centers. Reports with findings categorized as BI-RADS 1-5 and written in Italian, English, or Dutch were collected between January 2000 and October 2023. Board-certified breast radiologists and the LLMs GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 (OpenAI) and Bard, now called Gemini (Google), assigned BI-RADS categories using only the findings described by the original radiologists. Agreement between human readers and LLMs for BI-RADS categories was assessed using the Gwet agreement coefficient (AC1 value). Frequencies were calculated for changes in BI-RADS category assignments that would affect clinical management (ie, BI-RADS 0 vs BI-RADS 1 or 2 vs BI-RADS 3 vs BI-RADS 4 or 5) and compared using the McNemar test. Results Across 2400 reports, agreement between the original and reviewing radiologists was almost perfect (AC1 = 0.91), while agreement between the original radiologists and GPT-4, GPT-3.5, and Bard was moderate (AC1 = 0.52, 0.48, and 0.42, respectively). Across human readers and LLMs, differences were observed in the frequency of BI-RADS category upgrades or downgrades that would result in changed clinical management (118 of 2400 [4.9%] for human readers, 611 of 2400 [25.5%] for Bard, 573 of 2400 [23.9%] for GPT-3.5, and 435 of 2400 [18.1%] for GPT-4; ",1848
38683385,Quantitative assessment of background parenchymal enhancement is associated with lifetime breast cancer risk in screening MRI.,European radiology,2024,"To compare the quantitative background parenchymal enhancement (BPE) in women with different lifetime risks and BRCA mutation status of breast cancer using screening MRI. This study included screening MRI of 535 women divided into three groups based on lifetime risk: nonhigh-risk women, high-risk women without BRCA mutation, and BRCA1/2 mutation carriers. Six quantitative BPE measurements, including percent enhancement (PE) and signal enhancement ratio (SER), were calculated on DCE-MRI after segmentation of the whole breast and fibroglandular tissue (FGT). The associations between lifetime risk factors and BPE were analyzed via linear regression analysis. We adjusted for risk factors influencing BPE using propensity score matching (PSM) and compared the BPE between different groups. A two-sided Mann-Whitney U-test was used to compare the BPE with a threshold of 0.1 for multiple testing issue-adjusted p values. Age, BMI, menopausal status, and FGT level were significantly correlated with quantitative BPE based on the univariate and multivariable linear regression analyses. After adjusting for age, BMI, menopausal status, hormonal treatment history, and FGT level using PSM, significant differences were observed between high-risk non-BRCA and BRCA groups in PE Quantitative BPE varies in women with different lifetime breast cancer risks and BRCA mutation status. These differences may be due to the influence of multiple lifetime risk factors. Quantitative BPE differences remained between groups with and without BRCA mutations after adjusting for known risk factors associated with BPE. BRCA germline mutations may be associated with quantitative background parenchymal enhancement, excluding the effects of known confounding factors. This finding can provide potential insights into the cancer pathophysiological mechanisms behind lifetime risk models. Expanding understanding of breast cancer pathophysiology allows for improved risk stratification and optimized screening protocols. Quantitative BPE is significantly associated with lifetime risk factors and differs between BRCA mutation carriers and noncarriers. This research offers a possible understanding of the physiological mechanisms underlying quantitative BPE and BRCA germline mutations.",2272
38662100,Development and evaluation of two open-source nnU-Net models for automatic segmentation of lung tumors on PET and CT images with and without respiratory motion compensation.,European radiology,2024,"In lung cancer, one of the main limitations for the optimal integration of the biological and anatomical information derived from Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and Computed Tomography (CT) is the time and expertise required for the evaluation of the different respiratory phases. In this study, we present two open-source models able to automatically segment lung tumors on PET and CT, with and without motion compensation. This study involved time-bin gated (4D) and non-gated (3D) PET/CT images from two prospective lung cancer cohorts (Trials 108237 and 108472) and one retrospective. For model construction, the ground truth (GT) was defined by consensus of two experts, and the nnU-Net with 5-fold cross-validation was applied to 560 4D-images for PET and 100 3D-images for CT. The test sets included 270 4D- images and 19 3D-images for PET and 80 4D-images and 27 3D-images for CT, recruited at 10 different centres. In the performance evaluation with the multicentre test sets, the Dice Similarity Coefficients (DSC) obtained for our PET model were DSC(4D-PET) = 0.74 ± 0.06, improving 19% relative to the DSC between experts and DSC(3D-PET) = 0.82 ± 0.11. The performance for CT was DSC(4D-CT) = 0.61 ± 0.28 and DSC(3D-CT) = 0.63 ± 0.34, improving 4% and 15% relative to DSC between experts. Performance evaluation demonstrated that the automatic segmentation models have the potential to achieve accuracy comparable to manual segmentation and thus hold promise for clinical application. The resulting models can be freely downloaded and employed to support the integration of 3D- or 4D- PET/CT and to facilitate the evaluation of its impact on lung cancer clinical practice. We provide two open-source nnU-Net models for the automatic segmentation of lung tumors on PET/CT to facilitate the optimal integration of biological and anatomical information in clinical practice. The models have superior performance compared to the variability observed in manual segmentations by the different experts for images with and without motion compensation, allowing to take advantage in the clinical practice of the more accurate and robust 4D-quantification. Lung tumor segmentation on PET/CT imaging is limited by respiratory motion and manual delineation is time consuming and suffer from inter- and intra-variability. Our segmentation models had superior performance compared to the manual segmentations by different experts. Automating PET image segmentation allows for easier clinical implementation of biological information.",2535
38656711,ESR Essentials: screening for breast cancer - general recommendations by EUSOBI.,European radiology,2024,"Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer in women accounting for about 30% of all new cancer cases and the incidence is constantly increasing. Implementation of mammographic screening has contributed to a reduction in breast cancer mortality of at least 20% over the last 30 years. Screening programs usually include all women irrespective of their risk of developing breast cancer and with age being the only determining factor. This approach has some recognized limitations, including underdiagnosis, false positive cases, and overdiagnosis. Indeed, breast cancer remains a major cause of cancer-related deaths in women undergoing cancer screening. Supplemental imaging modalities, including digital breast tomosynthesis, ultrasound, breast MRI, and, more recently, contrast-enhanced mammography, are available and have already shown potential to further increase the diagnostic performances. Use of breast MRI is recommended in high-risk women and women with extremely dense breasts. Artificial intelligence has also shown promising results to support risk categorization and interval cancer reduction. The implementation of a risk-stratified approach instead of a ""one-size-fits-all"" approach may help to improve the benefit-to-harm ratio as well as the cost-effectiveness of breast cancer screening. KEY POINTS: Regular mammography should still be considered the mainstay of the breast cancer screening. High-risk women and women with extremely dense breast tissue should use MRI for supplemental screening or US if MRI is not available. Women need to participate actively in the decision to undergo personalized screening. KEY RECOMMENDATIONS: Mammography is an effective imaging tool to diagnose breast cancer in an early stage and to reduce breast cancer mortality (evidence level I). Until more evidence is available to move to a personalized approach, regular mammography should be considered the mainstay of the breast cancer screening. High-risk women should start screening earlier; first with yearly breast MRI which can be supplemented by yearly or biennial mammography starting at 35-40 years old (evidence level I). Breast MRI screening should be also offered to women with extremely dense breasts (evidence level I). If MRI is not available, ultrasound can be performed as an alternative, although the added value of supplemental ultrasound regarding cancer detection remains limited. Individual screening recommendations should be made through a shared decision-making process between women and physicians.",2538
38656709,Biparametric MRI in prostate cancer during active surveillance: is it safe?,European radiology,2024,"Active surveillance (AS) is the preferred option for patients presenting with low-intermediate-risk prostate cancer. MRI now plays a crucial role for baseline assessment and ongoing monitoring of AS. The Prostate Cancer Radiological Estimation of Change in Sequential Evaluation (PRECISE) recommendations aid radiological assessment of progression; however, current guidelines do not advise on MRI protocols nor on frequency. Biparametric (bp) imaging without contrast administration offers advantages such as reduced costs and increased throughput, with similar outcomes to multiparametric (mp) MRI shown in the biopsy naïve setting. In AS follow-up, the paradigm shifts from MRI lesion detection to assessment of progression, and patients have the further safety net of continuing clinical surveillance. As such, bpMRI may be appropriate in clinically stable patients on routine AS follow-up pathways; however, there is currently limited published evidence for this approach. It should be noted that mpMRI may be mandated in certain patients and potentially offers additional advantages, including improving image quality, new lesion detection, and staging accuracy. Recently developed AI solutions have enabled higher quality and faster scanning protocols, which may help mitigate against disadvantages of bpMRI. In this article, we explore the current role of MRI in AS and address the need for contrast-enhanced sequences. CLINICAL RELEVANCE STATEMENT: Active surveillance is the preferred plan for patients with lower-risk prostate cancer, and MRI plays a crucial role in patient selection and monitoring; however, current guidelines do not currently recommend how or when to perform MRI in follow-up. KEY POINTS: Noncontrast biparametric MRI has reduced costs and increased throughput and may be appropriate for monitoring stable patients. Multiparametric MRI may be mandated in certain patients, and contrast potentially offers additional advantages. AI solutions enable higher quality, faster scanning protocols, and could mitigate the disadvantages of biparametric imaging.",2083
38639912,Re-attendance in supplemental breast MRI screening rounds of the DENSE trial for women with extremely dense breasts.,European radiology,2024,"Supplemental MRI screening improves early breast cancer detection and reduces interval cancers in women with extremely dense breasts in a cost-effective way. Recently, the European Society of Breast Imaging recommended offering MRI screening to women with extremely dense breasts, but the debate on whether to implement it in breast cancer screening programs is ongoing. Insight into the participant experience and willingness to re-attend is important for this discussion. We calculated the re-attendance rates of the second and third MRI screening rounds of the DENSE trial. Moreover, we calculated age-adjusted odds ratios (ORs) to study the association between characteristics and re-attendance. Women who discontinued MRI screening were asked to provide one or more reasons for this. The re-attendance rates were 81.3% (3458/4252) and 85.2% (2693/3160) in the second and third MRI screening round, respectively. A high age (> 65 years), a very low BMI, lower education, not being employed, smoking, and no alcohol consumption were correlated with lower re-attendance rates. Moderate or high levels of pain, discomfort, or anxiety experienced during the previous MRI screening round were correlated with lower re-attendance rates. Finally, a plurality of women mentioned an examination-related inconvenience as a reason to discontinue screening (39.1% and 34.8% in the second and third screening round, respectively). The willingness of women with dense breasts to re-attend an ongoing MRI screening study is high. However, emphasis should be placed on improving the MRI experience to increase the re-attendance rate if widespread supplemental MRI screening is implemented. For many women, MRI is an acceptable screening method, as re-attendance rates were high - even for screening in a clinical trial setting. To further enhance the (re-)attendance rate, one possible approach could be improving the overall MRI experience. • The willingness to re-attend in an ongoing MRI screening study is high. • Pain, discomfort, and anxiety in the previous MRI screening round were related to lower re-attendance rates. • Emphasis should be placed on improving MRI experience to increase the re-attendance rate in supplemental MRI screening.",2236

A literature search was conducted using PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and Web of Science through August 2023. Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2 (QUADAS-2) was used to evaluate the risk of bias and applicability of the studies. The pooled sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio, negative likelihood ratio, and diagnostic odds ratio were calculated using the DerSimonian-Laird method. Univariate meta-regression analysis was used to identify the potential factors of heterogeneity. Twenty-four studies were included in this meta-analysis. The two main types of IPM, mass-forming pancreatitis (MFP) and autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP), differ in their apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values. Compared with PC, the ADC value was higher in MFP but lower in AIP. The pooled sensitivity/specificity of ADC were 0.80/0.85 for distinguishing MFP from PC and 0.82/0.84 for distinguishing AIP from PC. The pooled sensitivity/specificity for the maximal diameter of the upstream main pancreatic duct (dMPD) was 0.86/0.74, with a cutoff of dMPD ≤ 4 mm, and 0.97/0.52, with a cutoff of dMPD ≤ 5 mm. The pooled sensitivity/specificity for perfusion fraction (f) was 0.82/0.68, and 0.82/0.77 for mass stiffness values. Quantitative MR imaging biomarkers are useful in distinguishing between IPM and PC. ADC values differ between MFP and AIP, and they should be separated for consideration in future studies. Quantitative MR parameters could serve as non-invasive imaging biomarkers for differentiating malignant pancreatic neoplasms from inflammatory masses of the pancreas, and hence help to avoid unnecessary surgery. • Several quantitative MR imaging biomarkers performed well in differential diagnosis between inflammatory pancreatic mass and pancreatic cancer. • The ADC value could discern pancreatic cancer from mass-forming pancreatitis or autoimmune pancreatitis, if the two inflammatory mass types are not combined. • The diameter of main pancreatic duct had the highest specificity for differentiating autoimmune pancreatitis from pancreatic cancer.",2275

We aimed to develop a radiomic signature to reveal tumor immune heterogeneity and predict survival in locally recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma. This multicenter, retrospective study included 921 patients with locally recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma. A machine learning signature and nomogram based on pretreatment magnetic resonance imaging features were developed for predicting overall survival in a training cohort and validated in 2 independent cohorts. A clinical nomogram and an integrated nomogram were constructed for comparison. Nomogram performance was evaluated by concordance index and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. Accordingly, patients were classified into risk groups. The biological characteristics and immune infiltration of the signature were explored by RNA-sequencing analysis. The machine learning signature and nomogram demonstrated comparable prognostic ability to a clinical nomogram, achieving concordance indexes of 0.729, 0.718, and 0.731 in the training, internal, and external validation cohorts, respectively. Integration of the signature and clinical variables statistically improved the predictive performance. The proposed signature effectively distinguished patients between risk groups with statistically distinct overall survival rates. Subgroup analysis indicated the recommendation of local salvage treatments for low-risk patients. Exploratory RNA-sequencing analysis revealed differences in interferon response and lymphocyte infiltration between risk groups. A magnetic resonance imaging-based radiomic signature predicted overall survival more accurately. The proposed signature associated with tumor immune heterogeneity may serve as a valuable tool to facilitate prognostic stratification and guide individualized management for locally recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients.",2028

This was a retrospective cohort study of myxoid liposarcoma patients who underwent at least one WBMRI at our institution between October 2006 and December 2020. The effect of WBMRI on clinical management, namely treatment modification or additional diagnostic investigations was studied. A standardised WBMRI surveillance protocol was instituted in 2015. We compared patient outcomes for the metastatic patients who had and had not received regular WBMRI surveillance and performed survival analysis for both subgroups. Of the 56 patients (60.7% male, median age: 48.1 years) who underwent 345 WBMRI, 17 (30.3%) had metastases, and 168 WBMRI were performed in this group. The median imaging follow-up for the entire cohort was 35 months; the metastatic group had a median follow-up of 42 months. WBMRI changed the clinical management in 13 (76.5%) metastatic patients, with 33 instances of treatment modification. Thirty-five lesions were labelled 'indeterminate,' 16 (45.7%) had additional investigations/interventions, and 4 (11.4%) were confirmed to be metastatic. Twenty-one metastatic lesions were missed initially on WBMRI and confirmed on subsequent WBMRI, of which 5 (23.8%) were clinically significant. The 5-year survival since the detection of metastasis was better in the regular surveillance subgroup (85.7% vs. 45%), but this was not statistically significant (p = 0.068). Five patients (8.9%) developed their first metastasis more than 5 years after diagnosing the primary lesion. Regular WBMRI surveillance of myxoid liposarcoma patients considerably impacts clinical management by frequently influencing treatment decisions. WBMRI has been recently recommended as an imaging option for the staging and surveillance of myxoid liposarcoma patients. Our study highlights the impact of regular WBMRI surveillance on the clinical management of these patients and how it affects their survival.",2037
38635885,Deuterium Metabolic Imaging Differentiates Glioblastoma Metabolic Subtypes and Detects Early Response to Chemoradiotherapy.,Cancer research,2024,"Metabolic subtypes of glioblastoma (GBM) have different prognoses and responses to treatment. Deuterium metabolic imaging with 2H-labeled substrates is a potential approach to stratify patients into metabolic subtypes for targeted treatment. In this study, we used 2H magnetic resonance spectroscopy and magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) measurements of [6,6'-2H2]glucose metabolism to identify metabolic subtypes and their responses to chemoradiotherapy in patient-derived GBM xenografts in vivo. The metabolism of patient-derived cells was first characterized in vitro by measuring the oxygen consumption rate, a marker of mitochondrial tricarboxylic acid cycle activity, as well as the extracellular acidification rate and 2H-labeled lactate production from [6,6'-2H2]glucose, which are markers of glycolytic activity. Two cell lines representative of a glycolytic subtype and two representative of a mitochondrial subtype were identified. 2H magnetic resonance spectroscopy and MRSI measurements showed similar concentrations of 2H-labeled glucose from [6,6'-2H2]glucose in all four tumor models when implanted orthotopically in mice. The glycolytic subtypes showed higher concentrations of 2H-labeled lactate than the mitochondrial subtypes and normal-appearing brain tissue, whereas the mitochondrial subtypes showed more glutamate/glutamine labeling, a surrogate for tricarboxylic acid cycle activity, than the glycolytic subtypes and normal-appearing brain tissue. The response of the tumors to chemoradiation could be detected within 24 hours of treatment completion, with the mitochondrial subtypes showing a decrease in both 2H-labeled glutamate/glutamine and lactate concentrations and glycolytic tumors showing a decrease in 2H-labeled lactate concentration. This technique has the potential to be used clinically for treatment selection and early detection of treatment response. Deuterium magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging of glucose metabolism has the potential to differentiate between glycolytic and mitochondrial metabolic subtypes in glioblastoma and to evaluate early treatment responses, which could guide patient treatment.",2167
38634876,Radiomics and machine learning for renal tumor subtype assessment using multiphase computed tomography in a multicenter setting.,European radiology,2024,"To distinguish histological subtypes of renal tumors using radiomic features and machine learning (ML) based on multiphase computed tomography (CT). Patients who underwent surgical treatment for renal tumors at two tertiary centers from 2012 to 2022 were included retrospectively. Preoperative arterial (corticomedullary) and venous (nephrogenic) phase CT scans from these centers, as well as from external imaging facilities, were manually segmented, and standardized radiomic features were extracted. Following preprocessing and addressing the class imbalance, a ML algorithm based on extreme gradient boosting trees (XGB) was employed to predict renal tumor subtypes using 10-fold cross-validation. The evaluation was conducted using the multiclass area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Algorithms were trained on data from one center and independently tested on data from the other center. The training cohort comprised n = 297 patients (64.3% clear cell renal cell cancer [RCC], 13.5% papillary renal cell carcinoma (pRCC), 7.4% chromophobe RCC, 9.4% oncocytomas, and 5.4% angiomyolipomas (AML)), and the testing cohort n = 121 patients (56.2%/16.5%/3.3%/21.5%/2.5%). The XGB algorithm demonstrated a diagnostic performance of AUC = 0.81/0.64/0.8 for venous/arterial/combined contrast phase CT in the training cohort, and AUC = 0.75/0.67/0.75 in the independent testing cohort. In pairwise comparisons, the lowest diagnostic accuracy was evident for the identification of oncocytomas (AUC = 0.57-0.69), and the highest for the identification of AMLs (AUC = 0.9-0.94) CONCLUSION: Radiomic feature analyses can distinguish renal tumor subtypes on routinely acquired CTs, with oncocytomas being the hardest subtype to identify. Radiomic feature analyses yield robust results for renal tumor assessment on routine CTs. Although radiologists routinely rely on arterial phase CT for renal tumor assessment and operative planning, radiomic features derived from arterial phase did not improve the accuracy of renal tumor subtype identification in our cohort.",2080

38627290,Medical image foundation models in assisting diagnosis of brain tumors: a pilot study.,European radiology,2024,"To build self-supervised foundation models for multicontrast MRI of the whole brain and evaluate their efficacy in assisting diagnosis of brain tumors. In this retrospective study, foundation models were developed using 57,621 enhanced head MRI scans through self-supervised learning with a pretext task of cross-contrast context restoration with two different content dropout schemes. Downstream classifiers were constructed based on the pretrained foundation models and fine-tuned for brain tumor detection, discrimination, and molecular status prediction. Metrics including accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the ROC curve (AUC) were used to evaluate the performance. Convolutional neural networks trained exclusively on downstream task data were employed for comparative analysis. The pretrained foundation models demonstrated their ability to extract effective representations from multicontrast whole-brain volumes. The best classifiers, endowed with pretrained weights, showed remarkable performance with accuracies of 94.9, 92.3, and 80.4%, and corresponding AUC values of 0.981, 0.972, and 0.852 on independent test datasets in brain tumor detection, discrimination, and molecular status prediction, respectively. The classifiers with pretrained weights outperformed the convolutional classifiers trained from scratch by approximately 10% in terms of accuracy and AUC across all tasks. The saliency regions in the correctly predicted cases are mainly clustered around the tumors. Classifiers derived from the two dropout schemes differed significantly only in the detection of brain tumors. Foundation models obtained from self-supervised learning have demonstrated encouraging potential for scalability and interpretability in downstream brain tumor-related tasks and hold promise for extension to neurological diseases with diffusely distributed lesions. The application of our proposed method to the prediction of key molecular status in gliomas is expected to improve treatment planning and patient outcomes. Additionally, the foundation model we developed could serve as a cornerstone for advancing AI applications in the diagnosis of brain-related diseases.",2188

Radiomics, a promising field, aims to provide novel imaging biomarkers to improve outcomes. However, clinical translation faces reproducibility challenges, despite efforts to address them with quality scoring tools. This study had two objectives: 1) identify radiomics biomarkers in post-radiotherapy stage III/IV nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients, 2) evaluate research quality using the CLEAR (CheckList_for_EvaluAtion_of_Radiomics_research), RQS (Radiomics_Quality_Score) frameworks, and formulate an amalgamated CLEAR-RQS tool to enhance scientific rigor. A systematic literature review (Jun-Aug 2023, MEDLINE/PubMed/SCOPUS) was conducted concerning stage III/IV NSCLC, radiotherapy, and radiomic features (RF). Extracted data included study design particulars, such as sample size, radiotherapy/CT technique, selected RFs, and endpoints. CLEAR and RQS were merged into a CLEAR-RQS checklist. Three readers appraised articles utilizing CLEAR, RQS, and CLEAR-RQS metrics. Out of 871 articles, 11 met the inclusion/exclusion criteria. The Median cohort size was 91 (range: 10-337) with 9 studies being single-center. No common RF were identified. The merged CLEAR-RQS checklist comprised 61 items. Most unreported items were within CLEAR's ""methods"" and ""open-source,"" and within RQS's ""phantom-calibration,"" ""registry-enrolled prospective-trial-design,"" and ""cost-effective-analysis"" sections. No study scored above 50% on RQS. Median CLEAR scores were 55.74% (32.33/58 points), and for RQS, 17.59% (6.3/36 points). CLEAR-RQS article ranking fell between CLEAR and RQS and aligned with CLEAR. Radiomics research in post-radiotherapy stage III/IV NSCLC exhibits variability and frequently low-quality reporting. The formulated CLEAR-RQS checklist may facilitate education and holds promise for enhancing radiomics research quality. Current radiomics research in the field of stage III/IV postradiotherapy NSCLC is heterogenous, lacking reproducibility, with no identified imaging biomarker. Radiomics research quality assessment tools may enhance scientific rigor and thereby facilitate radiomics translation into clinical practice. There is heterogenous and low radiomics research quality in postradiotherapy stage III/IV nonsmall cell lung cancer. Barriers to reproducibility are small cohort size, nonvalidated studies, missing technical parameters, and lack of data, code, and model sharing.

Purpose To develop and validate a deep learning (DL) prognostic model using preoperative CT scans and clinical and radiologic information for risk stratification in patients with clinical stage IA NSCLC undergoing segmentectomy. Materials and Methods In this single-center retrospective study, transfer learning of a pretrained model was performed for survival prediction in patients with clinical stage IA NSCLC who underwent lobectomy from January 2008 to March 2017. The internal set was divided into training, validation, and testing sets based on the assignments from the pretraining set. The model was tested on an independent test set of patients with clinical stage IA NSCLC who underwent segmentectomy from January 2010 to December 2017. Its prognostic performance was analyzed using the time-dependent area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity for freedom from recurrence (FFR) at 2 and 4 years and lung cancer-specific survival and overall survival at 4 and 6 years. The model sensitivity and specificity were compared with those of the Japan Clinical Oncology Group (JCOG) eligibility criteria for sublobar resection. Results The pretraining set included 1756 patients. Transfer learning was performed in an internal set of 730 patients (median age, 63 years [IQR, 56-70 years]; 366 male), and the segmentectomy test set included 222 patients (median age, 65 years [IQR, 58-71 years]; 114 male).

Deep learning (DL) may improve ternary classification. Purpose To determine whether a strategy that includes an adjudication approach can enhance the performance of DL ternary classification models in predicting the invasiveness of adenocarcinoma at chest CT and maintain performance in classifying pGGNs. Materials and Methods In this retrospective study, six ternary models for classifying preinvasive, minimally invasive, and invasive adenocarcinoma were developed using a multicenter data set of lung nodules. The DL-based models were progressively modified through framework optimization, joint learning, and an adjudication strategy (simulating a multireader approach to resolving discordant nodule classifications), integrating two binary classification models with a ternary classification model to resolve discordant classifications sequentially.

Purpose To assess whether AISmartDensity-an AI-based score integrating cancer signs, masking, and risk-surpasses measurements of mammographic density in identifying patients for supplemental breast imaging after a negative screening mammogram. Materials and Methods This retrospective study included randomly selected individuals who underwent screening mammography at Karolinska University Hospital between January 2008 and December 2015. The models in AISmartDensity were trained and validated using nonoverlapping data. The ability of AISmartDensity to identify future cancer in patients with a negative screening mammogram was evaluated and compared with that of mammographic density models. Sensitivity and positive predictive value (PPV) were calculated for the top 8% of scores, mimicking the proportion of patients in the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System ""extremely dense"" category. Model performance was evaluated using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and was compared using the DeLong test.

Oncology,2024,"Patients with stage II-III HER2-positive breast cancer have good outcomes with the combination of neoadjuvant chemotherapy and HER2-targeted agents. Although increasing the number of chemotherapy cycles improves pathological complete response rates, early complete responses are common. We investigated whether the duration of chemotherapy could be tailored on the basis of radiological response. TRAIN-3 is a single-arm, phase 2 study in 43 hospitals in the Netherlands. Patients with stage II-III HER2-positive breast cancer aged 18 years or older and a WHO performance status of 0 or 1 were enrolled. Patients received neoadjuvant chemotherapy consisting of paclitaxel (80 mg/m Between April 1, 2019, and May 12, 2021, 235 patients with hormone receptor-negative cancer and 232 with hormone receptor-positive cancer were enrolled. Median follow-up was 26·4 months (IQR 22·9-32·9) for patients who were hormone receptor-negative and 31·6 months (25·6-35·7) for patients who were hormone receptor-positive. Overall, the median age was 51 years (IQR 43-59). In 233 patients with hormone receptor-negative tumours, radiological complete response was seen in 84 (36%; 95% CI 30-43) patients after one to three cycles, 140 (60%; 53-66) patients after one to six cycles, and 169 (73%; 66-78) patients after one to nine cycles. In 232 patients with hormone receptor-positive tumours, radiological complete response was seen in 68 (29%; 24-36) patients after one to three cycles, 118 (51%; 44-57) patients after one to six cycles, and 138 (59%; 53-66) patients after one to nine cycles. Among patients with a radiological complete response after one to nine cycles, a pathological complete response was seen in 147 (87%; 95% CI 81-92) of 169 patients with hormone receptor-negative tumours and was seen in 73 (53%; 44-61) of 138 patients with hormone receptor-positive tumours. The most common grade 3-4 adverse events were neutropenia (175 [37%] of 467), anaemia (75 [16%]), and diarrhoea (57 [12%]). No treatment-related deaths were reported. In our study, a third of patients with stage II-III hormone receptor-negative and HER2-positive breast cancer had a complete pathological response after only three cycles of neoadjuvant systemic therapy. A complete response on breast MRI could help identify early complete responders in patients who had hormone receptor negative tumours. An imaging-based strategy might limit the duration of chemotherapy in these patients, reduce side-effects, and maintain quality of life if confirmed by the analysis of the 3-year event-free survival primary endpoint.

38581609,An update on susceptibility-weighted imaging in brain gliomas.,European radiology,2024,"Susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) has become a standard component of most brain MRI protocols. While traditionally used for detecting and characterising brain hemorrhages typically associated with stroke or trauma, SWI has also shown promising results in glioma assessment. Numerous studies have highlighted SWI's role in differentiating gliomas from other brain lesions, such as primary central nervous system lymphomas or metastases. Additionally, SWI aids radiologists in non-invasively grading gliomas and predicting their phenotypic profiles. Various researchers have suggested incorporating SWI as an adjunct sequence for predicting treatment response and for post-treatment monitoring. A significant focus of these studies is on the detection of intratumoural susceptibility signals (ITSSs) in gliomas, which are indicative of microhemorrhages and vessels within the tumour. The quantity, distribution, and characteristics of these ITSSs can provide radiologists with more precise information for evaluating and characterising gliomas. Furthermore, the potential benefits and added value of performing SWI after the administration of gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) have been explored. This review offers a comprehensive, educational, and practical overview of the potential applications and future directions of SWI in the context of glioma assessment. CLINICAL RELEVANCE STATEMENT: SWI has proven effective in evaluating gliomas, especially through assessing intratumoural susceptibility signal changes, and is becoming a promising, easily integrated tool in MRI protocols for both pre- and post-treatment assessments. KEY POINTS: • Susceptibility-weighted imaging is the most sensitive sequence for detecting blood and calcium inside brain lesions. • This sequence, acquired with and without gadolinium, helps with glioma diagnosis, characterisation, and grading through the detection of intratumoural susceptibility signals. • There are ongoing challenges that must be faced to clarify the role of susceptibility-weighted imaging for glioma assessment.",2076
38576242,Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Prostate Cancer Screening: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,JAMA oncology,2024,"Prostate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is increasingly integrated within the prostate cancer (PCa) early detection pathway. To systematically evaluate the existing evidence regarding screening pathways incorporating MRI with targeted biopsy and assess their diagnostic value compared with prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-based screening with systematic biopsy strategies. PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane/Central, Scopus, and Web of Science (through May 2023). Randomized clinical trials and prospective cohort studies were eligible if they reported data on the diagnostic utility of prostate MRI in the setting of PCa screening. Number of screened individuals, biopsy indications, biopsies performed, clinically significant PCa (csPCa) defined as International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) grade 2 or higher, and insignificant (ISUP1) PCas detected were extracted. The primary outcome was csPCa detection rate. Secondary outcomes included clinical insignificant PCa detection rate, biopsy indication rates, and the positive predictive value for the detection of csPCa. The generalized mixed-effect approach with pooled odds ratios (ORs) and random-effect models was used to compare the MRI-based and PSA-only screening strategies. Separate analyses were performed based on the timing of MRI (primary/sequential after a PSA test) and cutoff (Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System [PI-RADS] score ≥3 or ≥4) for biopsy indication. Data were synthesized from 80 114 men from 12 studies. Compared with standard PSA-based screening, the MRI pathway (sequential screening, PI-RADS score ≥3 cutoff for biopsy) was associated with higher odds of csPCa when tests results were positive (OR, 4.15; 95% CI, 2.93-5.88; P ≤ .001), decreased odds of biopsies (OR, 0.28; 95% CI, 0.22-0.36; P ≤ .001), and insignificant cancers detected (OR, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.23-0.49; P = .002) without significant differences in the detection of csPCa (OR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.75-1.37; P = .86). Implementing a PI-RADS score of 4 or greater threshold for biopsy selection was associated with a further reduction in the odds of detecting insignificant PCa (OR, 0.23; 95% CI, 0.05-0.97; P = .048) and biopsies performed (OR, 0.19; 95% CI, 0.09-0.38; P = .01) without differences in csPCa detection (OR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.49-1.45; P = .22). The results of this systematic review and meta-analysis suggest that integrating MRI in PCa screening pathways is associated with a reduced number of unnecessary biopsies and overdiagnosis of insignificant PCa while maintaining csPCa detection as compared with PSA-only screening.",2597

A retrospective analysis was performed on 1109 breasts that underwent both mammography and US-guided breast biopsy. The AI software processed mammograms and provided an AI score ranging from 0 to 100 for each breast, indicating the likelihood of malignancy. The performance of the AI score in differentiating mammograms with benign outcomes from those revealing cancers following US-guided breast biopsy was evaluated. In addition, prediction models for benign outcomes were constructed based on clinical and imaging characteristics with and without AI scores, using logistic regression analysis. The AI software had an area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUROC) of 0.79 (95% CI, 0.79-0.82) in differentiating between benign and cancer cases. The prediction models that did not include AI scores (non-AI model), only used AI scores (AI-only model), and included AI scores (integrated model) had AUROCs of 0.79 (95% CI, 0.75-0.83), 0.78 (95% CI, 0.74-0.82), and 0.85 (95% CI, 0.81-0.88) in the development cohort, and 0.75 (95% CI, 0.68-0.81), 0.82 (95% CI, 0.76-0.88), and 0.84 (95% CI, 0.79-0.90) in the validation cohort, respectively.

This study aims to develop and validate an ultrasound-based ensemble machine learning (USEML) model, employing nonradiative and noninvasive features to differentiate PMA from WT. A total of 203 patients with histologically confirmed PMA or WT who underwent parotidectomy from two centers were enrolled. Clinical factors, ultrasound (US) features, and radiomic features were extracted to develop three types of machine learning model: clinical models, US models, and USEML models. The diagnostic performance of the USEML model, as well as that of physicians based on experience, was evaluated and validated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves in internal and external validation cohorts. DeLong's test was used for comparisons of AUCs. SHAP values were also utilized to explain the classification model. The USEML model achieved the highest AUC of 0.891 (95% CI, 0.774-0.961), surpassing the AUCs of both the US (0.847; 95% CI, 0.720-0.932) and clinical (0.814; 95% CI, 0.682-0.908) models. The USEML model also outperformed physicians in both internal and external validation datasets (both p < 0.05). The sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value, and positive predictive value of the USEML model and physician experience were 89.3%/75.0%, 87.5%/54.2%, 87.5%/65.6%, and 89.3%/65.0%, respectively. The USEML model, incorporating clinical factors, ultrasound factors, and radiomic features, demonstrated efficient performance in distinguishing PMA from WT in the parotid gland. This study developed a machine learning model for preoperative diagnosis of pleomorphic adenoma and Warthin tumor in the parotid gland based on clinical, ultrasound, and radiomic features. Furthermore, it outperformed physicians in an external validation dataset, indicating its potential for clinical application. • Differentiating pleomorphic adenoma (PMA) and Warthin tumor (WT) affects management decisions and is currently done by invasive biopsy. • Integration of US-radiomic, clinical, and ultrasound findings in a machine learning model results in improved diagnostic accuracy. • The ultrasound-based ensemble machine learning (USEML) model consistently outperforms physicians, suggesting its potential applicability in clinical settings.",2420

American journal of roentgenology,2025,"Multiparametric MRI (mpMRI), interpreted using PI-RADS, improves the initial detection of clinically significant prostate cancer. Prostate MR image quality has increasingly recognized relevance to the use of mpMRI for prostate cancer diagnosis. Additionally, mpMRI is increasingly used in scenarios beyond initial detection, including active surveillance and assessment for local recurrence after prostatectomy, radiation therapy, or focal therapy. In acknowledgment of these evolving demands, specialized prostate MRI scoring systems beyond PI-RADS have emerged to address distinct scenarios and unmet needs. Examples include Prostate Imaging Quality (PIQUAL) for assessment of image quality of mpMRI, Prostate Cancer Radiological Estimation of Change in Sequential Evaluation (PRECISE) recommendations for evaluation of serial mpMRI examinations during active surveillance, Prostate Imaging for Recurrence Reporting (PI-RR) system for assessment for local recurrence after prostatectomy or radiation therapy, and Prostate Imaging after Focal Ablation (PI-FAB) for assessment for local recurrence after focal therapy.

Purpose To compare the diagnostic performance of four different international HCC diagnosis guidelines and readers' judgment in diagnosing HCC using gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI in patients at high risk for HCC. Materials and Methods This retrospective study included patients who had not undergone treatment, were at risk for HCC, and who underwent gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI from January 2015 to June 2018 from 11 tertiary hospitals in South Korea. Four radiologists independently reviewed focal liver lesions (FLLs) according to four guidelines: American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD)/Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System (LI-RADS), Korean Liver Cancer Association-National Cancer Center (KLCA-NCC), European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL), and Asian Pacific Association for the Study of the Liver (APASL).

The mean age of the 87 patients was 45.69 ± 14.21 years (range 18-76 years), and the ratio of men to women was 1:4.8. The mean volumes were much decreased at the 12th month after ablation compared to the initial volumes (p < .001). The mean VRR was 76.09% at the 12th month. The technique efficacy (VRR > 50%) was 90.80% at the 12th month. A multivariate analysis revealed that VRR was related to the initial volume (p = .015), annular flow (p = .010), and nodule composition (p = .024). The mean symptomatic score decreased from 4.40 ± 0.28 to 0.26 ± 0.06 at the 12th month (p < .001). At the same time, the mean cosmetic score decreased from 3.22 ± 0.10 to 1.31 ± 0.08 (p < .001). MWA could serve as a safe and effective therapy for large BTNs, significantly reducing the volume of BTNs and significantly improving compressive symptoms and appearance problems. Microwave ablation could serve as a safe and effective therapy for large benign thyroid nodules, leading to significant volume reduction and satisfied symptom and cosmetic alleviation period. • This multicenter study investigated the feasibility and safety of microwave ablation for large benign thyroid nodules. • After ablation, the nodule volume was significantly reduced, and patients' symptoms and appearance problems were significantly improved. • Microwave ablation is feasible for large benign thyroid nodules and has been a supplement treatment.",2002
38546790,Optimized signal of calcifications in wide-angle digital breast tomosynthesis: a virtual imaging trial.,European radiology,2024,"Evaluate microcalcification detectability in digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) and synthetic 2D mammography (SM) for different acquisition setups using a virtual imaging trial (VIT) approach. Medio-lateral oblique (MLO) DBT acquisitions on eight patients were performed at twice the automatic exposure controlled (AEC) dose. The noise was added to the projections to simulate a given dose trajectory. Virtual microcalcification models were added to a given projection set using an in-house VIT framework. Three setups were evaluated: (1) standard acquisition with 25 projections at AEC dose, (2) 25 projections with a convex dose distribution, and (3) sparse setup with 13 projections, every second one over the angular range. The total scan dose and angular range remained constant. DBT volume reconstruction and synthetic mammography image generation were performed using a Siemens prototype algorithm. Lesion detectability was assessed through a Jackknife-alternative free-response receiver operating characteristic (JAFROC) study with six observers. For DBT, the area under the curve (AUC) was 0.97 ± 0.01 for the standard, 0.95 ± 0.02 for the convex, and 0.89 ± 0.03 for the sparse setup. There was no significant difference between standard and convex dose distributions (p = 0.309). Sparse projections significantly reduced detectability (p = 0.001). Synthetic images had a higher AUC with the convex setup, though not significantly (p = 0.435). DBT required four times more reading time than synthetic mammography. A convex setup did not significantly improve detectability in DBT compared to the standard setup. Synthetic images exhibited a non-significant increase in detectability with the convex setup. Sparse setup significantly reduced detectability in both DBT and synthetic mammography. This virtual imaging trial study allowed the design and efficient testing of different dose distribution trajectories with real mammography images, using a dose-neutral protocol. • In DBT, a convex dose distribution did not increase the detectability of microcalcifications compared to the current standard setup but increased detectability for the SM images. • A sparse setup decreased microcalcification detectability in both DBT and SM images compared to the convex and current clinical setups. • Optimal microcalcification cluster detection in the system studied was achieved using either the standard or convex dose setting, with the default number of projections.",2473
38538841,Reduction of false positives using zone-specific prostate-specific antigen density for prostate MRI-based biopsy decision strategies.,European radiology,2024,"To develop and test zone-specific prostate-specific antigen density (sPSAD) combined with PI-RADS to guide prostate biopsy decision strategies (BDS). This retrospective study included consecutive patients, who underwent prostate MRI and biopsy (01/2012-10/2018). The whole gland and transition zone (TZ) were segmented at MRI using a retrained deep learning system (DLS; nnU-Net) to calculate PSAD and sPSAD, respectively. Additionally, sPSAD and PI-RADS were combined in a BDS, and diagnostic performances to detect Grade Group ≥ 2 (GG ≥ 2) prostate cancer were compared. Patient-based cancer detection using sPSAD was assessed by bootstrapping with 1000 repetitions and reported as area under the curve (AUC). Clinical utility of the BDS was tested in the hold-out test set using decision curve analysis. Statistics included nonparametric DeLong test for AUCs and Fisher-Yates test for remaining performance metrics. A total of 1604 patients aged 67 (interquartile range, 61-73) with 48% GG ≥ 2 prevalence (774/1604) were evaluated. By employing DLS-based prostate and TZ volumes (DICE coefficients of 0.89 (95% confidence interval, 0.80-0.97) and 0.84 (0.70-0.99)), GG ≥ 2 detection using PSAD was inferior to sPSAD (AUC, 0.71 (0.68-0.74)/0.73 (0.70-0.76); p < 0.001). Combining PI-RADS with sPSAD, GG ≥ 2 detection specificity doubled from 18% (10-20%) to 43% (30-44%; p < 0.001) with similar sensitivity (93% (89-96%)/97% (94-99%); p = 0.052), when biopsies were taken in PI-RADS 4-5 and 3 only if sPSAD was ≥ 0.42 ng/mL/cc as compared to all PI-RADS 3-5 cases. Additionally, using the sPSAD-based BDS, false positives were reduced by 25% (123 (104-142)/165 (146-185); p < 0.001). Using sPSAD to guide biopsy decisions in PI-RADS 3 lesions can reduce false positives at MRI while maintaining high sensitivity for GG ≥ 2 cancers. Transition zone-specific prostate-specific antigen density can improve the accuracy of prostate cancer detection compared to MRI assessments alone, by lowering false-positive cases without significantly missing men with ISUP GG ≥ 2 cancers. • Prostate biopsy decision strategies using PI-RADS at MRI are limited by a substantial proportion of false positives, not yielding grade group ≥ 2 prostate cancer. • PI-RADS combined with transition zone (TZ)-specific prostate-specific antigen density (PSAD) decreased the number of unproductive biopsies by 25% compared to PI-RADS only. • TZ-specific PSAD also improved the specificity of MRI-directed biopsies by 9% compared to the whole gland PSAD, while showing identical sensitivity.",2564
38536464,Automated graded prognostic assessment for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma using machine learning.,European radiology,2024,"Accurate mortality risk quantification is crucial for the management of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC); however, most scoring systems are subjective. To develop and independently validate a machine learning mortality risk quantification method for HCC patients using standard-of-care clinical data and liver radiomics on baseline magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This retrospective study included all patients with multiphasic contrast-enhanced MRI at the time of diagnosis treated at our institution. Patients were censored at their last date of follow-up, end-of-observation, or liver transplantation date. The data were randomly sampled into independent cohorts, with 85% for development and 15% for independent validation. An automated liver segmentation framework was adopted for radiomic feature extraction. A random survival forest combined clinical and radiomic variables to predict overall survival (OS), and performance was evaluated using Harrell's C-index. A total of 555 treatment-naïve HCC patients (mean age, 63.8 years ± 8.9 [standard deviation]; 118 females) with MRI at the time of diagnosis were included, of which 287 (51.7%) died after a median time of 14.40 (interquartile range, 22.23) months, and had median followed up of 32.47 (interquartile range, 61.5) months. The developed risk prediction framework required 1.11 min on average and yielded C-indices of 0.8503 and 0.8234 in the development and independent validation cohorts, respectively, outperforming conventional clinical staging systems. Predicted risk scores were significantly associated with OS (p < .00001 in both cohorts). Machine learning reliably, rapidly, and reproducibly predicts mortality risk in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma from data routinely acquired in clinical practice. Precision mortality risk prediction using routinely available standard-of-care clinical data and automated MRI radiomic features could enable personalized follow-up strategies, guide management decisions, and improve clinical workflow efficiency in tumor boards. • Machine learning enables hepatocellular carcinoma mortality risk prediction using standard-of-care clinical data and automated radiomic features from multiphasic contrast-enhanced MRI. • Automated mortality risk prediction achieved state-of-the-art performances for mortality risk quantification and outperformed conventional clinical staging systems. • Patients were stratified into low, intermediate, and high-risk groups with significantly different survival times, generalizable to an independent evaluation cohort.",2568
38536463,Enhancing a deep learning model for pulmonary nodule malignancy risk estimation in chest CT with uncertainty estimation.,European radiology,2024,"To investigate the effect of uncertainty estimation on the performance of a Deep Learning (DL) algorithm for estimating malignancy risk of pulmonary nodules. In this retrospective study, we integrated an uncertainty estimation method into a previously developed DL algorithm for nodule malignancy risk estimation. Uncertainty thresholds were developed using CT data from the Danish Lung Cancer Screening Trial (DLCST), containing 883 nodules (65 malignant) collected between 2004 and 2010. We used thresholds on the 90th and 95th percentiles of the uncertainty score distribution to categorize nodules into certain and uncertain groups. External validation was performed on clinical CT data from a tertiary academic center containing 374 nodules (207 malignant) collected between 2004 and 2012. DL performance was measured using area under the ROC curve (AUC) for the full set of nodules, for the certain cases and for the uncertain cases. Additionally, nodule characteristics were compared to identify trends for inducing uncertainty. The DL algorithm performed significantly worse in the uncertain group compared to the certain group of DLCST (AUC 0.62 (95% CI: 0.49, 0.76) vs 0.93 (95% CI: 0.88, 0.97); p < .001) and the clinical dataset (AUC 0.62 (95% CI: 0.50, 0.73) vs 0.90 (95% CI: 0.86, 0.94); p < .001). The uncertain group included larger benign nodules as well as more part-solid and non-solid nodules than the certain group. The integrated uncertainty estimation showed excellent performance for identifying uncertain cases in which the DL-based nodule malignancy risk estimation algorithm had significantly worse performance. Deep Learning algorithms often lack the ability to gauge and communicate uncertainty. For safe clinical implementation, uncertainty estimation is of pivotal importance to identify cases where the deep learning algorithm harbors doubt in its prediction. • Deep learning (DL) algorithms often lack uncertainty estimation, which potentially reduce the risk of errors and improve safety during clinical adoption of the DL algorithm. • Uncertainty estimation identifies pulmonary nodules in which the discriminative performance of the DL algorithm is significantly worse. • Uncertainty estimation can further enhance the benefits of the DL algorithm and improve its safety and trustworthiness.",2327
38536460,Prediction of tumor recurrence after surgical resection of ampullary adenocarcinoma using magnetic resonance imaging.,European radiology,2024,"To predict tumor recurrence in patients who underwent surgical resection of ampullary adenocarcinoma using preoperative magnetic resonance (MR) imaging findings combined with clinical findings. In this multicenter study, a total of 113 patients (mean age, 62.9 ± 9.8 years; 58 men and 55 women) with ampullary adenocarcinoma who underwent preoperative MR imaging and surgery with margin-negative resection between 2006 and 2017 were retrospectively included. The MR imaging findings were evaluated by two radiologists. Preoperative clinical findings were obtained. Cox proportional regression analyses were used to identify the independent prognostic factors for recurrence-free survival (RFS). A nomogram was created based on the multivariable analysis and was internally validated. Multivariable analysis revealed that presence of infiltrative tumor margin (hazard ratio [HR]: 2.18, p = 0.019), adjacent organ invasion (HR: 3.31, p = 0.006), adjacent vessel invasion (HR: 5.42, p = 0.041), peripancreatic lymph node enlargement (HR: 2.1, p = 0.019), and jaundice (HR: 1.93, p = 0.043) were significantly associated with worse RFS of ampullary adenocarcinoma after surgical resection. These MR imaging and clinical findings were used to construct a nomogram. On internal validation, the calibration plots showed excellent agreement between the predicted probabilities and the actual rates of tumor recurrence, with Harrell's c-index of 0.746. Combination of preoperative MR imaging and clinical findings can be useful for predicting tumor recurrence after surgical resection of ampullary adenocarcinoma. Identifying these features before surgery may aid in better treatment planning and management of these patients. A predictive nomogram using preoperative MR imaging and clinical findings can be useful in estimating the recurrence-free survival after surgical resection of ampullary adenocarcinoma. • Presently, tumor size on imaging is the only non-invasive factor that correlates with recurrence-free survival from ampullary adenocarcinoma; other factors are obtained postoperatively. • Infiltrative tumor margin, adjacent organ invasion, adjacent vessel invasion, peripancreatic lymph node enlargement on MRI, and jaundice are significant predictors for recurrence. • A nomogram incorporating significant MR imaging and clinical findings showed good performance in predicting recurrence-free survival, which can help in treatment planning.",2446

38528136,"AI performance by mammographic density in a retrospective cohort study of 99,489 participants in BreastScreen Norway.",European radiology,2024,"To explore the ability of artificial intelligence (AI) to classify breast cancer by mammographic density in an organized screening program. We included information about 99,489 examinations from 74,941 women who participated in BreastScreen Norway, 2013-2019. All examinations were analyzed with an AI system that assigned a malignancy risk score (AI score) from 1 (lowest) to 10 (highest) for each examination. Mammographic density was classified into Volpara density grade (VDG), VDG1-4; VDG1 indicated fatty and VDG4 extremely dense breasts. Screen-detected and interval cancers with an AI score of 1-10 were stratified by VDG. We found 10,406 (10.5% of the total) examinations to have an AI risk score of 10, of which 6.7% (704/10,406) was breast cancer. The cancers represented 89.7% (617/688) of the screen-detected and 44.6% (87/195) of the interval cancers. 20.3% (20,178/99,489) of the examinations were classified as VDG1 and 6.1% (6047/99,489) as VDG4. For screen-detected cancers, 84.0% (68/81, 95% CI, 74.1-91.2) had an AI score of 10 for VDG1, 88.9% (328/369, 95% CI, 85.2-91.9) for VDG2, 92.5% (185/200, 95% CI, 87.9-95.7) for VDG3, and 94.7% (36/38, 95% CI, 82.3-99.4) for VDG4. For interval cancers, the percentages with an AI score of 10 were 33.3% (3/9, 95% CI, 7.5-70.1) for VDG1 and 48.0% (12/25, 95% CI, 27.8-68.7) for VDG4. The tested AI system performed well according to cancer detection across all density categories, especially for extremely dense breasts. The highest proportion of screen-detected cancers with an AI score of 10 was observed for women classified as VDG4. Our study demonstrates that AI can correctly classify the majority of screen-detected and about half of the interval breast cancers, regardless of breast density. • Mammographic density is important to consider in the evaluation of artificial intelligence in mammographic screening. • Given a threshold representing about 10% of those with the highest malignancy risk score by an AI system, we found an increasing percentage of cancers with increasing mammographic density. • Artificial intelligence risk score and mammographic density combined may help triage examinations to reduce workload for radiologists.",2210

This prospective study enrolled 70 patients with adult-type diffuse gliomas who underwent multiple b-value DWI. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values including ADC All ADCs were significantly higher in IDH mutant gliomas than in IDH wild-type gliomas (p < 0.01 for all); ADC Ultra-high b-value DWI can reliably separate IDH genotypes and tumor subtypes of adult-type diffuse gliomas using WHO CNS5 criteria. Ultra-high b-value diffusion-weighted imaging can accurately distinguish isocitrate dehydrogenase genotypes and tumor subtypes of adult-type diffuse gliomas, which may facilitate personalized treatment and prognostic assessment for patients with glioma. • Ultra-high b-value diffusion-weighted imaging can accurately distinguish subtle differences in water diffusion among biological tissues. • Ultra-high b-value diffusion-weighted imaging can reliably separate isocitrate dehydrogenase genotypes and tumor subtypes of adult-type diffuse gliomas. • Compared with standard b-value diffusion-weighted imaging, high and ultra-high b-value diffusion-weighted imaging demonstrate better diagnostic performances.",1432
38526750,Multicentre validation of CT grey-level co-occurrence matrix features for overall survival in primary oesophageal adenocarcinoma.,European radiology,2024,"Personalising management of primary oesophageal adenocarcinoma requires better risk stratification. Lack of independent validation of proposed imaging biomarkers has hampered clinical translation. We aimed to prospectively validate previously identified prognostic grey-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) CT features for 3-year overall survival. Following ethical approval, clinical and contrast-enhanced CT data were acquired from participants from five institutions. Data from three institutions were used for training and two for testing. Survival classifiers were modelled on prespecified variables ('Clinical' model: age, clinical T-stage, clinical N-stage; 'ClinVol' model: clinical features + CT tumour volume; 'ClinRad' model: ClinVol features + GLCM_Correlation and GLCM_Contrast). To reflect current clinical practice, baseline stage was also modelled as a univariate predictor ('Stage'). Discrimination was assessed by area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) analysis; calibration by Brier scores; and clinical relevance by thresholding risk scores to achieve 90% sensitivity for 3-year mortality. A total of 162 participants were included (144 male; median 67 years [IQR 59, 72]; training, 95 participants; testing, 67 participants). Median survival was 998 days [IQR 486, 1594]. The ClinRad model yielded the greatest test discrimination (AUC, 0.68 [95% CI 0.54, 0.81]) that outperformed Stage (ΔAUC, 0.12 [95% CI 0.01, 0.23]; p = .04). The Clinical and ClinVol models yielded comparable test discrimination (AUC, 0.66 [95% CI 0.51, 0.80] vs. 0.65 [95% CI 0.50, 0.79]; p > .05). Test sensitivity of 90% was achieved by ClinRad and Stage models only. Compared to Stage, multivariable models of prespecified clinical and radiomic variables yielded improved prediction of 3-year overall survival. Previously identified radiomic features are prognostic but may not substantially improve risk stratification on their own. • Better risk stratification is needed in primary oesophageal cancer to personalise management. • Previously identified CT features-GLCM_Correlation and GLCM_Contrast-contain incremental prognostic information to age and clinical stage. • Compared to staging, multivariable clinicoradiomic models improve discrimination of 3-year overall survival.",2282
38526414,A Prospective Double-Blinded Comparison of Reflectance Confocal Microscopy with Conventional Histopathology for In Vivo Assessment in Oral Cancer.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,2024,"We investigated reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) as a possible noninvasive approach for the diagnosis of cancer and real-time assessment of surgical margins. In a phase I study on 20 patients, we established the RCM imaging morphologic features that distinguish oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) from normal tissue with a newly developed intraoral RCM probe. Our subsequent phase II prospective double-blinded study in 60 patients tested the diagnostic accuracy of RCM against histopathology. Five RCM videos from the tumor and five from normal surrounding mucosa were collected on each patient, followed by a 3-mm punch biopsy of the imaged area. An experienced RCM reader, who was blinded to biopsy location and histologic diagnosis, examined the videos from both regions and classified each as ""tumor"" or ""not tumor"" based on RCM features established in phase I. Hematoxylin and eosin slides from the biopsies were read by a pathologist who was blinded to RCM results. Using histology as the gold standard, we calculated the sensitivity and specificity of RCM. We report a high agreement between the blinded readers (95% for normal tissue and 81.7% for tumors), high specificity (98.3%) and negative predictive values (96.6%) for normal tissue identification, and high sensitivity (90%) and positive predictive values (88.2%) for tumor detection. RCM imaging is a promising technology for noninvasive in vivo diagnosis of OSCC and for real-time intraoperative evaluation of mucosal surgical margins. Its inherent constraint, however, stems from the diminished capability to evaluate structures located at more substantial depths within the tissue.",1657
38514481,Radiomics-based nomogram guides adaptive de-intensification in locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma following induction chemotherapy.,European radiology,2024,"This study aimed to construct a radiomics-based model for prognosis and benefit prediction of concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) versus intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) in locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma (LANPC) following induction chemotherapy (IC). A cohort of 718 LANPC patients treated with IC + IMRT or IC + CCRT were retrospectively enrolled and assigned to a training set (n = 503) and a validation set (n = 215). Radiomic features were extracted from pre-IC and post-IC MRI. After feature selection, a delta-radiomics signature was built with LASSO-Cox regression. A nomogram incorporating independent clinical indicators and the delta-radiomics signature was then developed and evaluated for calibration and discrimination. Risk stratification by the nomogram was evaluated with Kaplan-Meier methods. The delta-radiomics signature, which comprised 19 selected features, was independently associated with prognosis. The nomogram, composed of the delta-radiomics signature, age, T category, N category, treatment, and pre-treatment EBV DNA, showed great calibration and discrimination with an area under the receiver operator characteristic curve of 0.80 (95% CI 0.75-0.85) and 0.75 (95% CI 0.64-0.85) in the training and validation sets. Risk stratification by the nomogram, excluding the treatment factor, resulted in two groups with distinct overall survival. Significantly better outcomes were observed in the high-risk patients with IC + CCRT compared to those with IC + IMRT, while comparable outcomes between IC + IMRT and IC + CCRT were shown for low-risk patients. The radiomics-based nomogram can predict prognosis and survival benefits from concurrent chemotherapy for LANPC following IC. Low-risk patients determined by the nomogram may be potential candidates for omitting concurrent chemotherapy during IMRT. The radiomics-based nomogram was constructed for risk stratification and patient selection. It can help guide clinical decision-making for patients with locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma following induction chemotherapy, and avoid unnecessary toxicity caused by overtreatment. • The benefits from concurrent chemotherapy remained controversial for locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma following induction chemotherapy. • Radiomics-based nomogram achieved prognosis and benefits prediction of concurrent chemotherapy. • Low-risk patients defined by the nomogram were candidates for de-intensification.",2482

A comprehensive search was conducted until September 1, 2023, in Medline, Embase, and Cochrane databases. Clinical studies evaluating the diagnostic performance of UF-DCE MRI in breast lesion stratification were screened and included in the meta-analysis. Pooled summary estimates for sensitivity, specificity, diagnostic odds ratio (DOR), and hierarchic summary operating characteristics (SROC) curves were pooled under the random-effects model. Publication bias and heterogeneity between studies were calculated. A final set of 16 studies analyzing 2090 lesions met the inclusion criteria and were incorporated into the meta-analysis. Using UF-DCE MRI kinetic parameters, the pooled sensitivity, specificity, DOR, and area under the curve (AUC) for differentiating benign from malignant breast lesions were 83% (95% CI 79-88%), 77% (95% CI 72-83%), 18.9 (95% CI 13.7-26.2), and 0.876 (95% CI 0.83-0.887), respectively. We found no significant difference in diagnostic accuracy between the two main UF-DCE MRI kinetic parameters, maximum slope (MS) and time to enhancement (TTE). DOR and SROC exhibited low heterogeneity across the included studies. No evidence of publication bias was identified (p = 0.585). UF-DCE MRI as a stand-alone technique has high accuracy in discriminating benign from malignant breast lesions. UF-DCE MRI has the potential to obtain kinetic information and stratify breast lesions accurately while decreasing scan times, which may offer significant benefit to patients. • Ultrafast breast MRI is a novel technique which captures kinetic information with very high temporal resolution. • The kinetic parameters of ultrafast breast MRI demonstrate a high level of accuracy in distinguishing between benign and malignant breast lesions. • There is no significant difference in accuracy between maximum slope and time to enhancement kinetic parameters.",2024

Random-effects model was constructed to calculate pooled diagnostic odds ratios (DORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for each MRI feature for differentiating MTM-HCC from NMTM-HCC. The pooled proportions of LI-RADS category assignments in MTM-HCC and NMTM-HCC were compared using z-test. Ten studies included 1978 patients with 2031 HCCs (426 (20.9%) MTM-HCC and 1605 (79.1%) NMTM-HCC). Six MRI features showed significant association with MTM-HCC: tumor in vein (TIV) (DOR = 2.4 [95% CI, 1.6-3.5]), rim arterial phase hyperenhancement (DOR =2.6 [95% CI, 1.4-5.0]), corona enhancement (DOR = 2.6 [95% CI, 1.4-4.5]), intratumoral arteries (DOR = 2.6 [95% CI, 1.1-6.3]), peritumoral hypointensity on hepatobiliary phase (DOR = 2.2 [95% CI, 1.5-3.3]), and necrosis (DOR = 4.2 [95% CI, 2.0-8.5]).

MTM-HCC had significantly lower proportion of LR-5 and higher proportion of LR-M and LR-TIV categories. Six MRI features showed significant association with MTM-HCC. Additionally, compared to NMTM-HCC, MTM-HCC are more likely to be categorized LR-M and LR-TIV and less likely to be categorized LR-5. Several MR imaging features can suggest macrotrabecular-massive hepatocellular carcinoma subtype, which can assist in guiding treatment plans and identifying potential candidates for clinical trials of new treatment strategies. • Macrotrabecular-massive hepatocellular carcinoma is a subtype of HCC characterized by its aggressive nature and unfavorable prognosis. • Tumor in vein, rim arterial phase hyperenhancement, corona enhancement, intratumoral arteries, peritumoral hypointensity on hepatobiliary phase, and necrosis on MRI are indicative of macrotrabecular-massive hepatocellular carcinoma. • Various MRI characteristics can be utilized for the diagnosis of the macrotrabecular-massive hepatocellular carcinoma subtype.

Gradient-boosted decision tree models were separately trained using clinical features alone and in combination with radiological reporting and/or prostate radiomic features to predict pathological T, pathological N, ISUP score, and their change from preclinical assessment. Model behavior was analyzed in terms of performance, feature importance, Shapley additive explanation (SHAP) values, and mean absolute error (MAE). The best model was compared against a naïve model mimicking clinical workflow. The model including all variables was the best performing (AUC values ranging from 0.73 to 0.96 for the six endpoints). Radiomic features brought a small yet measurable boost in performance, with the SHAP values indicating that their contribution can be critical to successful prediction of endpoints for individual patients. MAEs were lower for low-risk patients, suggesting that the models find them easier to classify. The best model outperformed (p ≤ 0.0001) clinical baseline, resulting in significantly fewer false negative predictions and overall was less prone to under-staging. Our results highlight the potential benefit of integrative ML models for pathological status prediction in PCa. Additional studies regarding clinical integration of such models can provide valuable information for personalizing therapy offering a tool to improve non-invasive prediction of pathological status. The best machine learning model was less prone to under-staging of the disease. The improved accuracy of our pathological prediction models could constitute an asset to the clinical workflow by providing clinicians with accurate pathological predictions prior to treatment. • Currently, the most common strategies for pre-surgical stratification of prostate cancer (PCa) patients have shown to have suboptimal performances. • The addition of radiological features to the clinical features gave a considerable boost in model performance. Our best model outperforms the naïve model, avoiding under-staging and resulting in a critical advantage in the clinic. •Machine learning models incorporating clinical, radiological, and radiomics features significantly improved accuracy of pathological prediction in prostate cancer, possibly constituting an asset to the clinical workflow.",2678
38503918,Expect the unexpected: investigating discordant prostate MRI and biopsy results.,European radiology,2024,"To evaluate discrepant radio-pathological outcomes in biopsy-naïve patients undergoing prostate MRI and to provide insights into the underlying causes. A retrospective analysis was conducted on 2780 biopsy-naïve patients undergoing prostate MRI at a tertiary referral centre between October 2015 and June 2022. Exclusion criteria were biopsy not performed, indeterminate MRI findings (PI-RADS 3), and clinically insignificant PCa (Gleason score 3 + 3). Patients with discrepant findings between MRI and biopsy results were categorised into two groups: MRI-negative/Biopsy-positive and MRI-positive/Biopsy-negative (biopsy-positive defined as Gleason score ≥ 3 + 4). An expert uroradiologist reviewed discrepant cases, retrospectively re-assigning PI-RADS scores, identifying any missed MRI targets, and evaluating the quality of MRI scans. Potential explanations for discrepancies included MRI overcalls (including known pitfalls), benign pathology findings, and biopsy targeting errors. Patients who did not undergo biopsy (n = 1258) or who had indeterminate MRI findings (n = 204), as well as those with clinically insignificant PCa (n = 216), were excluded, with a total of 1102 patients analysed. Of these, 32/1,102 (3%) were classified as MRI-negative/biopsy-positive and 117/1102 (11%) as MRI-positive/biopsy-negative. In the MRI-negative/Biopsy-positive group, 44% of studies were considered non-diagnostic quality. Upon retrospective image review, target lesions were identified in 28% of cases. In the MRI-positive/Biopsy-negative group, 42% of cases were considered to be MRI overcalls, and 32% had an explanatory benign pathological finding, with biopsy targeting errors accounting for 11% of cases. Prostate MRI demonstrated a high diagnostic accuracy, with low occurrences of discrepant findings as defined. Common reasons for MRI-positive/Biopsy-negative cases included explanatory benign findings and MRI overcalls. This study highlights the importance of optimal prostate MRI image quality and expertise in reducing diagnostic errors, improving patient outcomes, and guiding appropriate management decisions in the prostate cancer diagnostic pathway. • Discrepancies between prostate MRI and biopsy results can occur, with higher numbers of MRI-positive/biopsy-negative relative to MRI-negative/biopsy-positive cases. • MRI-positive/biopsy-negative cases were mostly overcalls or explainable by benign biopsy findings. • In about one-third of MRI-negative/biopsy-positive cases, a target lesion was retrospectively identified.",2542
38501952,AsymMirai: Interpretable Mammography-based Deep Learning Model for 1-5-year Breast Cancer Risk Prediction.,Radiology,2024,"Background Mirai, a state-of-the-art deep learning-based algorithm for predicting short-term breast cancer risk, outperforms standard clinical risk models. However, Mirai is a black box, risking overreliance on the algorithm and incorrect diagnoses. Purpose To identify whether bilateral dissimilarity underpins Mirai's reasoning process; create a simplified, intelligible model, AsymMirai, using bilateral dissimilarity; and determine if AsymMirai may approximate Mirai's performance in 1-5-year breast cancer risk prediction. Materials and Methods This retrospective study involved mammograms obtained from patients in the EMory BrEast imaging Dataset, known as EMBED, from January 2013 to December 2020. To approximate 1-5-year breast cancer risk predictions from Mirai, another deep learning-based model, AsymMirai, was built with an interpretable module: local bilateral dissimilarity (localized differences between left and right breast tissue). Pearson correlation coefficients were computed between the risk scores of Mirai and those of AsymMirai. Subgroup analysis was performed in patients for whom AsymMirai's year-over-year reasoning was consistent. AsymMirai and Mirai risk scores were compared using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), and 95% CIs were calculated using the DeLong method.

38493804,Noninvasive Stratification of Colon Cancer by Multiplex PET Imaging.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,2024,"The current approach for molecular subtyping of colon cancer relies on gene expression profiling, which is invasive and has limited ability to reveal dynamics and spatial heterogeneity. Molecular imaging techniques, such as PET, present a noninvasive alternative for visualizing biological information from tumors. However, the factors influencing PET imaging phenotype, the suitable PET radiotracers for differentiating tumor subtypes, and the relationship between PET phenotypes and tumor genotype or gene expression-based subtyping remain unknown. In this study, we conducted 126 PET scans using four different metabolic PET tracers, [18F]fluorodeoxy-D-glucose ([18F]FDG), O-(2-[18F]fluoroethyl)-l-tyrosine ([18F]FET), 3'-deoxy-3'-[18F]fluorothymidine ([18F]FLT), and [11C]acetate ([11C]ACE), using a spectrum of five preclinical colon cancer models with varying genetics (BMT, AKPN, AK, AKPT, KPN), at three sites (subcutaneous, orthograft, autochthonous) and at two tumor stages (primary vs. metastatic). The results demonstrate that imaging signatures are influenced by genotype, tumor environment, and stage. PET imaging signatures exhibited significant heterogeneity, with each cancer model displaying distinct radiotracer profiles. Oncogenic Kras and Apc loss showed the most distinctive imaging features, with [18F]FLT and [18F]FET being particularly effective, respectively. The tissue environment notably impacted [18F]FDG uptake, and in a metastatic model, [18F]FET demonstrated higher uptake. By examining factors contributing to PET-imaging phenotype, this study establishes the feasibility of noninvasive molecular stratification using multiplex radiotracer PET. It lays the foundation for further exploration of PET-based subtyping in human cancer, thereby facilitating noninvasive molecular diagnosis.",1819
38492004,Enhancing gadoxetic acid-enhanced liver MRI: a synergistic approach with deep learning CAIPIRINHA-VIBE and optimized fat suppression techniques.,European radiology,2024,"To investigate whether a deep learning (DL) controlled aliasing in parallel imaging results in higher acceleration (CAIPIRINHA)-volumetric interpolated breath-hold examination (VIBE) technique can improve image quality, lesion conspicuity, and lesion detection compared to a standard CAIPIRINHA-VIBE technique in gadoxetic acid-enhanced liver MRI. This retrospective single-center study included 168 patients who underwent gadoxetic acid-enhanced liver MRI at 3 T using both standard CAIPIRINHA-VIBE and DL CAIPIRINHA-VIBE techniques on pre-contrast and hepatobiliary phase (HBP) images. Additionally, high-resolution (HR) DL CAIPIRINHA-VIBE was obtained with 1-mm slice thickness on the HBP. Three abdominal radiologists independently assessed the image quality and lesion conspicuity of pre-contrast and HBP images. Statistical analyses involved the Wilcoxon signed-rank test for image quality assessment and the generalized estimation equation for lesion conspicuity and detection evaluation. DL and HR-DL CAIPIRINHA-VIBE demonstrated significantly improved overall image quality and reduced artifacts on pre-contrast and HBP images compared to standard CAIPIRINHA-VIBE (p < 0.001), with a shorter acquisition time (DL vs standard, 11 s vs 17 s). However, the former presented a more synthetic appearance (both p < 0.05). HR-DL CAIPIRINHA-VIBE showed superior lesion conspicuity to standard and DL CAIPIRINHA-VIBE on HBP images (p < 0.001). Moreover, HR-DL CAIPIRINHA-VIBE exhibited a significantly higher detection rate of small (< 2 cm) solid focal liver lesions (FLLs) on HBP images compared to standard CAIPIRINHA-VIBE (92.5% vs 87.4%; odds ratio = 1.83; p = 0.036). DL and HR-DL CAIPIRINHA-VIBE achieved superior image quality compared to standard CAIPIRINHA-VIBE. Additionally, HR-DL CAIPIRINHA-VIBE improved the lesion conspicuity and detection of small solid FLLs. DL and HR-DL CAIPIRINHA-VIBE hold the potential clinical utility for gadoxetic acid-enhanced liver MRI. DL and HR-DL CAIPIRINHA-VIBE hold promise as potential alternatives to standard CAIPIRINHA-VIBE in routine clinical liver MRI, improving the image quality and lesion conspicuity, enhancing the detection of small (< 2 cm) solid focal liver lesions, and reducing the acquisition time. • DL and HR-DL CAIPIRINHA-VIBE demonstrated improved overall image quality and reduced artifacts on pre-contrast and HBP images compared to standard CAIPIRINHA-VIBE, in addition to a shorter acquisition time. • DL and HR-DL CAIPIRINHA-VIBE yielded a more synthetic appearance than standard CAIPIRINHA-VIBE. • HR-DL CAIPIRINHA-VIBE showed improved lesion conspicuity than standard CAIPIRINHA-VIBE on HBP images, with a higher detection of small (< 2 cm) solid focal liver lesions.",2742
38491129,Synthetic MRI and amide proton transfer-weighted MRI for differentiating between benign and malignant sinonasal lesions.,European radiology,2024,"To explore the value of the synthetic MRI (SyMRI), combined with amide proton transfer-weighted (APTw) MRI for quantitative and morphologic assessment of sinonasal lesions, which could provide relative scale for the quantitative assessment of tissue properties. A total of 80 patients (31 malignant and 49 benign) with sinonasal lesions, who underwent the SyMRI and APTw examination, were retrospectively analyzed. Quantitative parameters (T1, T2, proton density (PD)) and APT % were obtained through outlining the region of interest (ROI) and comparing the two groups utilizing independent Student t test or a Wilcoxon test. Receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC), Delong test, and logistic regression analysis were performed to assess the diagnostic efficiency of one-parameter and multiparametric models. SyMRI-derived mean T1, T2, and PD were significantly higher and APT % was relatively lower in benign compared to malignant sinonasal lesions (p < 0.05). The ROC analysis showed that the AUCs of the SyMRI-derived quantitative (T1, T2, PD) values and APT % ranged from 0.677 to 0.781 for differential diagnosis between benign and malignant sinonasal lesions. The T2 values showed the best diagnostic performance among all single parameters for differentiating these two masses. The AUCs of combined SyMRI-derived multiple parameters with APT % (AUC = 0.866) were the highest than that of any single parameter, which was significantly improved (p < 0.05). The combination of SyMRI and APTw imaging has the potential to reflect intrinsic tissue characteristics useful for differentiating benign from malignant sinonasal lesions. Combining synthetic MRI with amide proton transfer-weighted imaging could function as a quantitative and contrast-free approach, significantly enhancing the differentiation of benign and malignant sinonasal lesions and overcoming the limitations associated with the superficial nature of endoscopic nasal sampling. • Synthetic MRI and amide proton transfer-weighted MRI could differentiate benign from malignant sinonasal lesions based on quantitative parameters. • The diagnostic efficiency could be significantly improved through synthetic MRI + amide proton transfer-weighted imaging. • The combination of synthetic MRI and amide proton transfer-weighted MRI is a noninvasive method to evaluate sinonasal lesions.",2356
38491128,Evaluating persistent T1-weighted lesions without concurrent abnormal enhancement on breast MRI in neoadjuvant chemotherapy patients: implications for complete pathological response.,European radiology,2024,"This study aims to determine whether persistent T1-weighted lesions signify a complete pathological response (pCR) in breast cancer patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy and surgery, and to evaluate their correlation with imaging responses on MRI. A retrospective review was conducted on data from breast cancer patients treated between January 2011 and December 2018. Patients who underwent breast MRI and pre- and post-neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgery were included. Those with distant metastasis, no planned surgery, pre-surgery radiation, ineligibility for neoadjuvant chemotherapy, or unavailable surgical pathology were excluded. Groups with and without persistent T1-weighted lesions were compared using the chi-square test for categorical variables and the Student t test or Wilcox rank sum test for continuous variables. Univariate logistic regression was used to evaluate the association of the final pathological response with the presence of T1-persistent lesion and other characteristics. Out of 319 patients, 294 met the inclusion criteria (breast cancer patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy and subsequent surgery); 157 had persistent T1 lesions on post-chemotherapy MRI and 137 did not. A persistent T1 lesion indicated reduced likelihood of complete pathological response (14% vs. 39%, p < 0.001) and imaging response (69% vs. 93%, p < 0.001). Multivariable analysis confirmed these findings: OR 0.37 (95% CI 0.18-0.76), p = 0.007. No other characteristics correlated with T1 residual lesions. Persistent T1-weighted lesions without associated abnormal enhancement on post-treatment breast MRI correlate with lower complete pathological and imaging response rates. The study underscores the importance of persistent T1-weighted lesions on breast MRI as vital clinical markers, being inversely related to a complete pathological response following neoadjuvant chemotherapy; they should be a key factor in guiding post-neoadjuvant chemotherapy treatment decisions. • Persistent T1 lesions on post-chemotherapy breast MRI indicate a reduced likelihood of achieving a complete pathological response (14% vs. 39%, p < 0.001) and imaging response (69% vs. 93%, p < 0.001). • Through multivariable analysis, it was confirmed that the presence of a persistent T1 lesion on breast MRI post-chemotherapy is linked to a decreased likelihood of complete pathological response, with an odds ratio (OR) of 0.37 (95% CI 0.18-0.76; p = 0.007). • In addition to the convention of equating the absence of residual enhancement to complete imaging response, our results suggest that the presence or absence of residual T1 lesions should also be considered.",2684
38488971,Recommender-based bone tumour classification with radiographs-a link to the past.,European radiology,2024,"To develop an algorithm to link undiagnosed patients to previous patient histories based on radiographs, and simultaneous classification of multiple bone tumours to enable early and specific diagnosis. For this retrospective study, data from 2000 to 2021 were curated from our database by two orthopaedic surgeons, a radiologist and a data scientist. Patients with complete clinical and pre-therapy radiographic data were eligible. To ensure feasibility, the ten most frequent primary tumour entities, confirmed histologically or by tumour board decision, were included. We implemented a ResNet and transformer model to establish baseline results. Our method extracts image features using deep learning and then clusters the k most similar images to the target image using a hash-based nearest-neighbour recommender approach that performs simultaneous classification by majority voting. The results were evaluated with precision-at-k, accuracy, precision and recall. Discrete parameters were described by incidence and percentage ratios. For continuous parameters, based on a normality test, respective statistical measures were calculated. Included were data from 809 patients (1792 radiographs; mean age 33.73 ± 18.65, range 3-89 years; 443 men), with Osteochondroma (28.31%) and Ewing sarcoma (1.11%) as the most and least common entities, respectively. The dataset was split into training (80%) and test subsets (20%). For k = 3, our model achieved the highest mean accuracy, precision and recall (92.86%, 92.86% and 34.08%), significantly outperforming state-of-the-art models (54.10%, 55.57%, 19.85% and 62.80%, 61.33%, 23.05%). Our novel approach surpasses current models in tumour classification and links to past patient data, leveraging expert insights. The proposed algorithm could serve as a vital support tool for clinicians and general practitioners with limited experience in bone tumour classification by identifying similar cases and classifying bone tumour entities. • Addressed accurate bone tumour classification using radiographic features. • Model achieved 92.86%, 92.86% and 34.08% mean accuracy, precision and recall, respectively, significantly surpassing state-of-the-art models. • Enhanced diagnosis by integrating prior expert patient assessments.",2275
38488968,"MR-contrast enhanced mammography (CEM) for follow-up of breast cancer patients: a ""pros and cons"" debate.",European radiology,2024,"Women with a personal history of breast cancer (PHBC) are at an increased risk of either a local recurrence or a new primary breast cancer. Thus, surveillance is essential for the detection of recurrent disease at the earliest possible stage, allowing for prompt treatment, and potentially improving overall survival. Nowadays, mammography follow-up is the only surveillance imaging technique recommended by international guidelines. Nevertheless, sensitivity of mammography is lower after breast cancer treatment, particularly during the first 5 years, due to increased density or post-treatment changes. Contrast-enhanced breast imaging techniques, such as MRI or contrast-enhanced mammography (CEM), are very sensitive to detect malignant enhancement, especially in dense breasts. This Special Report will provide arguments in favor of and against breast cancer follow-up with MRI or CEM, in a debate style between experts in Breast Imaging. Finally, the scientific points of pros and cons arguments will be summarized to help objectively decide the best follow-up strategy for women with a personal history of breast cancer. CLINICAL RELEVANCE STATEMENT: A personalized approach to follow-up imaging after conservative breast cancer treatment could optimize patient outcomes, using mammography as a baseline for most patients, and MRI or CEM selectively in patients with higher risks for a recurrence. KEY POINTS: • Women with a personal history of breast cancer are at an increased risk of either a local recurrence or a new primary breast cancer. • Breast cancer survivors may benefit from additional imaging with MRI/CEM, in case of increased risk of a second breast cancer, with dense breasts or a cancer diagnosis before age 50 years. • As survival after local recurrence seems to depend on the initial stage at diagnosis, imaging should be more focused on detecting tumors in the earliest stages.",1906
38488967,Does the presence of macroscopic intralesional fat exclude malignancy? An analysis of 613 histologically proven malignant bone lesions.,European radiology,2024,"To determine if macroscopic intralesional fat detected in bone lesions on CT by Hounsfield unit (HU) measurement and on MRI by macroscopic assessment excludes malignancy. All consecutive CT-guided core needle biopsies (CNB) of non-spinal bone lesions performed at a tertiary center between December 2005 and September 2021 were reviewed. Demographic and histopathology data were recorded. All cases with malignant histopathology were selected, and imaging studies were reviewed. Two independent readers performed CT HU measurements on all bone lesions using a circular region of interest (ROI) to quantitate intralesional fat density (mean HU < -30). MRI images were reviewed to qualitatively assess for macroscopic intralesional fat signal in a subset of patients. Inter-reader agreement was assessed with Cronbach's alpha and intraclass correlation coefficient. In 613 patients (mean age 62.9 years (range 19-95 years), 47.6% female), CT scans from the CNB of 613 malignant bone lesions were reviewed, and 212 cases had additional MRI images. Only 3 cases (0.5%) demonstrated macroscopic intralesional fat on either CT or MRI. One case demonstrated macroscopic intralesional fat density on CT in a case of metastatic prostate cancer. Two cases demonstrated macroscopic intralesional fat signal on MRI in cases of chondrosarcoma and osteosarcoma. Inter-reader agreement was excellent (Cronbach's alpha, 0.95-0.98; intraclass correlation coefficient, 0.90-0.97). Malignant lesions rarely contain macroscopic intralesional fat on CT or MRI. While CT is effective in detecting macroscopic intralesional fat in primarily lytic lesions, MRI may be better for the assessment of heterogenous and infiltrative lesions with mixed lytic and sclerotic components. Macroscopic intralesional fat is rarely seen in malignant bone tumors and its presence can help to guide the diagnostic workup of bone lesions. • Presence of macroscopic intralesional fat in bone lesions has been widely theorized as a sign of benignity, but there is limited supporting evidence in the literature. • CT and MRI are effective in evaluating for macroscopic intralesional fat in malignant bone lesions with excellent inter-reader agreement. • Macroscopic intralesional fat is rarely seen in malignant bone lesions.",2281
38485749,High-performance presurgical differentiation of glioblastoma and metastasis by means of multiparametric neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) radiomics.,European radiology,2024,"To evaluate the performance of multiparametric neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) radiomics in distinguishing between glioblastoma (Gb) and solitary brain metastasis (SBM). In this retrospective study, NODDI images were curated from 109 patients with Gb (n = 57) or SBM (n = 52). Automatically segmented multiple volumes of interest (VOIs) encompassed the main tumor regions, including necrosis, solid tumor, and peritumoral edema. Radiomics features were extracted for each main tumor region, using three NODDI parameter maps. Radiomics models were developed based on these three NODDI parameter maps and their amalgamation to differentiate between Gb and SBM. Additionally, radiomics models were constructed based on morphological magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and diffusion imaging (diffusion-weighted imaging [DWI]; diffusion tensor imaging [DTI]) for performance comparison. The validation dataset results revealed that the performance of a single NODDI parameter map model was inferior to that of the combined NODDI model. In the necrotic regions, the combined NODDI radiomics model exhibited less than ideal discriminative capabilities (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC] = 0.701). For peritumoral edema regions, the combined NODDI radiomics model achieved a moderate level of discrimination (AUC = 0.820). Within the solid tumor regions, the combined NODDI radiomics model demonstrated superior performance (AUC = 0.904), surpassing the models of other VOIs. The comparison results demonstrated that the NODDI model was better than the DWI and DTI models, while those of the morphological MRI and NODDI models were similar. The NODDI radiomics model showed promising performance for preoperative discrimination between Gb and SBM. The NODDI radiomics model showed promising performance for preoperative discrimination between Gb and SBM, and radiomics features can be incorporated into the multidimensional phenotypic features that describe tumor heterogeneity. • The neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) radiomics model showed promising performance for preoperative discrimination between glioblastoma and solitary brain metastasis. • Compared with other tumor volumes of interest, the NODDI radiomics model based on solid tumor regions performed best in distinguishing the two types of tumors. • The performance of the single-parameter NODDI model was inferior to that of the combined-parameter NODDI model.",2492

Patients with adrenal masses and contrast-enhanced CT scans in portal venous phase were included. Image reconstructions were performed, including conventional VNC (VNC The final study cohort consisted of 90 patients (36 female, mean age 67.8 years [range 39-87]) with adrenal lesions (45 adenomas, 45 metastases). Compared to metastases, adrenal adenomas showed significantly lower CT-values in VNC VNC algorithms overestimate CT values compared to TNC in the assessment of adrenal lesions. However, they allow a reliable discrimination between adrenal adenomas and metastases and could be used in clinical routine in near future with an increased threshold (e.g., 26 HU). Further (multi-center) studies with larger patient cohorts and standardized protocols are required. VNC reconstructions overestimate CT values compared to TNC. Using a different threshold (e.g., 26 HU compared to the established 10 HU), VNC has a high diagnostic accuracy for the discrimination between adrenal adenomas and metastases. • Virtual non-contrast reconstructions may be promising tools to differentiate adrenal lesions and might save further diagnostic tests. • The conventional and a new calcium-preserving virtual non-contrast algorithm tend to systematically overestimate CT-values compared to true non-contrast images. • Therefore, increasing the established threshold for true non-contrast images (e.g., 10HU) may help to differentiate between adrenal adenomas and metastases on contrast-enhanced CT.",1680

The diagnosis and staging of liver fibrosis is crucial to determine management and mitigate complications. Liver biopsy for histologic assessment has limitations such as sampling bias and high interreader variability that reduce precision, which is particularly challenging in longitudinal monitoring. MR elastography (MRE) is considered the most accurate noninvasive technique for diagnosing and staging liver fibrosis. In MRE, low-frequency vibrations are applied to the abdomen, and the propagation of shear waves through the liver is analyzed to measure liver stiffness, a biomarker for the detection and staging of liver fibrosis. As MRE has become more widely used in clinical care and research, different contexts of use have emerged. This review focuses on the latest developments in the use of MRE for the assessment of liver fibrosis; provides guidance for image acquisition and interpretation; summarizes diagnostic performance, along with thresholds for diagnosis and staging of liver fibrosis; discusses current and emerging clinical applications; and describes the latest technical developments.",1262
38466940,Predicting five-year interval second breast cancer risk in women with prior breast cancer.,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,2024,"Annual surveillance mammography is recommended for women with a personal history of breast cancer. Risk prediction models that estimate mammography failures such as interval second breast cancers could help to tailor surveillance imaging regimens to women's individual risk profiles. In a cohort of women with a history of breast cancer receiving surveillance mammography in the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium in 1996-2019, we used Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO)-penalized regression to estimate the probability of an interval second cancer (invasive cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ) in the 1 year after a negative surveillance mammogram. Based on predicted risks from this one-year risk model, we generated cumulative risks of an interval second cancer for the five-year period after each mammogram. Model performance was evaluated using cross-validation in the overall cohort and within race and ethnicity strata. In 173 290 surveillance mammograms, we observed 496 interval cancers. One-year risk models were well-calibrated (expected/observed ratio = 1.00) with good accuracy (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.64). Model performance was similar across race and ethnicity groups. The median five-year cumulative risk was 1.20% (interquartile range 0.93%-1.63%). Median five-year risks were highest in women who were under age 40 or pre- or perimenopausal at diagnosis and those with estrogen receptor-negative primary breast cancers. Our risk model identified women at high risk of interval second breast cancers who may benefit from additional surveillance imaging modalities. Risk models should be evaluated to determine if risk-guided supplemental surveillance imaging improves early detection and decreases surveillance failures.",1797

Oncology,2024,"The extended acquisition times required for MRI limit its availability in resource-constrained settings. Consequently, accelerating MRI by undersampling k-space data, which is necessary to reconstruct an image, has been a long-standing but important challenge. We aimed to develop a deep convolutional neural network (dCNN) optimisation method for MRI reconstruction and to reduce scan times and evaluate its effect on image quality and accuracy of oncological imaging biomarkers. In this multicentre, retrospective, cohort study, MRI data from patients with glioblastoma treated at Heidelberg University Hospital (775 patients and 775 examinations) and from the phase 2 CORE trial (260 patients, 1083 examinations, and 58 institutions) and the phase 3 CENTRIC trial (505 patients, 3147 examinations, and 139 institutions) were used to develop, train, and test dCNN for reconstructing MRI from highly undersampled single-coil k-space data with various acceleration rates (R=2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 15). Independent testing was performed with MRIs from the phase 2/3 EORTC-26101 trial (528 patients with glioblastoma, 1974 examinations, and 32 institutions). The similarity between undersampled dCNN-reconstructed and original MRIs was quantified with various image quality metrics, including structural similarity index measure (SSIM) and the accuracy of undersampled dCNN-reconstructed MRI on downstream radiological assessment of imaging biomarkers in oncology (automated artificial intelligence-based quantification of tumour burden and treatment response) was performed in the EORTC-26101 test dataset. The public NYU Langone Health fastMRI brain test dataset (558 patients and 558 examinations) was used to validate the generalisability and robustness of the dCNN for reconstructing MRIs from available multi-coil (parallel imaging) k-space data. In the EORTC-26101 test dataset, the median SSIM of undersampled dCNN-reconstructed MRI ranged from 0·88 to 0·99 across different acceleration rates, with 0·92 (95% CI 0·92-0·93) for 10-times acceleration (R=10).

Surveillance with MRI is effective in downstaging breast cancers, but the association of MRI surveillance with mortality risk has not been well defined. To compare breast cancer mortality rates in women with a BRCA1 or BRCA2 sequence variation who entered an MRI surveillance program with those who did not. Women with a BRCA1 or BRCA2 sequence variation were identified from 59 participating centers in 11 countries. Participants completed a baseline questionnaire between 1995 and 2015 and a follow-up questionnaire every 2 years to document screening histories, incident cancers, and vital status. Women who had breast cancer, a screening MRI examination, or bilateral mastectomy prior to enrollment were excluded. Participants were followed up from age 30 years (or the date of the baseline questionnaire, whichever was later) until age 75 years, the last follow-up, or death from breast cancer. Data were analyzed from January 1 to July 31, 2023. Entrance into an MRI surveillance program. Cox proportional hazards modeling was used to estimate the hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs for breast cancer mortality associated with MRI surveillance compared with no MRI surveillance using a time-dependent analysis. A total of 2488 women (mean [range] age at study entry 41.2 [30-69] years), with a sequence variation in the BRCA1 (n = 2004) or BRCA2 (n = 484) genes were included in the analysis. Of these participants, 1756 (70.6%) had at least 1 screening MRI examination and 732 women (29.4%) did not. After a mean follow-up of 9.2 years, 344 women (13.8%) developed breast cancer and 35 women (1.4%) died of breast cancer.

38418627,ESR Essentials: Imaging in colorectal cancer-practice recommendations by ESGAR.,European radiology,2024,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a significant global health concern. Diagnostic imaging, using different modalities, has a pivotal role in CRC, from early detection (i.e., screening) to follow-up. The role of imaging in CRC screening depends on each country's approach: if an organized screening program is in place, the role of CT colonography (CTC) is limited to the study of either individuals with a positive stool test unwilling/unable to undergo colonoscopy (CC) or in patients with incomplete CC. Although CC is the most common modality to diagnose CRC, CRC can be also incidentally detected during a routine abdominal imaging examination or at the emergency room in patients presenting with intestinal occlusion/subocclusion or perforation. Staging is a crucial aspect of CRC management, guiding treatment decisions and providing valuable prognostic information. An accurate local staging is mandatory in both rectal and colon cancer to drive the appropriate therapeutic workflow. Important limitations of US, CT, and MR in N-staging can be partially solved by FDG PET/CT. Distant staging is usually managed by CT, with MR and FDG PET/CT which can be used as problem-solving techniques. Follow-up is performed according to the general recommendations of the oncological societies. CLINICAL RELEVANCE STATEMENT: It is essential to summarize each phase of colorectal cancer workup, differentiating the management for colon and rectal cancer supported by the main international guidelines and literature data, with the aim to inform the community on the best practice imaging in colorectal cancer. KEY POINTS: • Colorectal cancer is a prevalent disease that lends itself to imaging at each stage of detection and management. • Various imaging modalities can be used as adjuncts to, or in place of, direct visualization methods of screening and are necessary for evaluating metastatic disease. • Reevaluation of follow-up strategies should be considered depending on patients' individual risk of recurrence.",2006
38415576,"Contrast-Enhanced Ultrasound of the Indeterminate Renal Mass, From the ",AJR. American journal of roentgenology,2024,"Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) is distinguished from CT and MRI by the use of microbubble ultrasound contrast agents (UCAs) with intravascular blood pool distribution. When performing CEUS, low-intensity ultrasound allows real-time tissue subtraction imaging, whereas high-intensity ultrasound leads to microbubble destruction, enabling visualization of the contrast inflow pattern. CEUS has exceptional contrast resolution that enables the detection of even minimal blood flow, achieving very high NPV for ruling out vascular perfusion and providing high frame rates in the evaluation of tissue perfusion dynamics. UCAs undergo hepatic metabolism and pulmonary clearance, ensuring safety in patients with renal impairment. CEUS excels in distinguishing solid from cystic renal masses, with higher sensitivity than CT or MRI for detection of lesion enhancement. CEUS can aid the further characterization of both solid and cystic lesions and may have particular applications in the surveillance of cystic masses and surveillance after renal cell carcinoma ablation. This review describes the use of CEUS to help characterize indeterminate renal masses, based on the authors' institutional experience. The article highlights key differences between CEUS and CT or MRI and provides practical insights for performing and interpreting CEUS of renal masses.",1356

We retrospectively reviewed our institutional biopsy database and included 150 consecutive MRI-guided biopsies for renal masses between November 2007 and March 2020. We recorded age, sex, BMI, tumor characteristics, RENAL nephrometry score, MRI scan sequence, biopsy technique, complications, diagnostic yield, pathologic outcome, and follow-up imaging. Univariate logistic regression was used to assess the association between different parameters and the development of complications. McNemar's test was used to assess the association between paired diagnostic yield measurements for fine-needle aspiration and core samples. A total of 150 biopsies for 150 lesions were performed in 150 patients. The median tumor size was 2.7 cm. The median BMI was 28.3. The lesions were solid, partially necrotic/cystic, and predominantly cystic in 137, eight, and five patients, respectively. Image guidance using fat saturation steady-state free precession sequence was recorded in 95% of the biopsy procedures. Samples were obtained using both fine-needle aspiration (FNA) and cores in 99 patients (66%), cores only in 40 (26%), and FNA only in three (2%). Tissue sampling was diagnostic in 144 (96%) lesions.

In a retrospective study from 2022, we compared the performance of an AI system with independent double reading according to cancer detection. We found 93% (880/949) of the screen-detected cancers, and 40% (122/305) of the interval cancers to have the highest AI risk score (AI score of 10). In this study, four breast radiologists reviewed mammograms from 126 randomly selected screen-detected cancers and all 120 interval cancers with an AI score of 10. The location of the AI marking was stated as correct/not correct in craniocaudal and mediolateral oblique view. Interval cancers with an AI score of 10 were classified as false negative, minimal sign significant/non-specific, or true negative. All screen-detected cancers and 78% (93/120) of the interval cancers with an AI score of 10 were correctly located by the AI system. The AI markings matched in both views for 79% (100/126) of the screen-detected cancers and 22% (26/120) of the interval cancers. For interval cancers with an AI score of 10, 11% (13/120) were correctly located and classified as false negative, 10% (12/120) as minimal sign significant, 26% (31/120) as minimal sign non-specific, and 31% (37/120) as true negative. AI markings corresponded to cancer location for all screen-detected cancers and 78% of the interval cancers with high AI score, indicating a potential for reducing the number of interval cancers. However, it is uncertain whether interval cancers with subtle findings in only one view are actionable for recall in a true screening setting. In this study, AI markings corresponded to the location of the cancer in a high percentage of cases, indicating that the AI system accurately identifies the cancer location in mammograms with a high AI score. • All screen-detected and 78% of the interval cancers with high AI risk score (AI score of 10) had AI markings in one or two views corresponding to the location of the cancer on diagnostic images. • Among all 120 interval cancers with an AI score of 10, 21% (25/120) were classified as a false negative or minimal sign significant and had AI markings matching the cancer location, suggesting they may be visible on prior screening. • Most of the correctly located interval cancers matched only in one view, and the majority were classified as either true negative or minimal sign non-specific, indicating low potential for being detected earlier in a real screening setting.",2632
38388721,Artificial intelligence support in MR imaging of incidental renal masses: an early health technology assessment.,European radiology,2024,"This study analyzes the potential cost-effectiveness of integrating an artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted system into the differentiation of incidental renal lesions as benign or malignant on MR images during follow-up. For estimation of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and lifetime costs, a decision model was created, including the MRI strategy and MRI + AI strategy. Model input parameters were derived from recent literature. Willingness to pay (WTP) was set to $100,000/QALY. Costs of $0 for the AI were assumed in the base-case scenario. Model uncertainty and costs of the AI system were assessed using deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analysis. Average total costs were at $8054 for the MRI strategy and $7939 for additional use of an AI-based algorithm. The model yielded a cumulative effectiveness of 8.76 QALYs for the MRI strategy and of 8.77 for the MRI + AI strategy. The economically dominant strategy was MRI + AI. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed high robustness of the model with the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), which represents the incremental cost associated with one additional QALY gained, remaining below the WTP for variation of the input parameters. If increasing costs for the algorithm, the ICER of $0/QALY was exceeded at $115, and the defined WTP was exceeded at $667 for the use of the AI. This analysis, rooted in assumptions, suggests that the additional use of an AI-based algorithm may be a potentially cost-effective alternative in the differentiation of incidental renal lesions using MRI and needs to be confirmed in the future. These results hint at AI's the potential impact on diagnosing renal masses. While the current study urges careful interpretation, ongoing research is essential to confirm and seamlessly integrate AI into clinical practice, ensuring its efficacy in routine diagnostics. • This is a model-based study using data from literature where AI has been applied in the diagnostic workup of incidental renal lesions. • MRI + AI has the potential to be a cost-effective alternative in the differentiation of incidental renal lesions. • The additional use of AI can reduce costs in the diagnostic workup of incidental renal lesions.",2246

The study included 22,621 mammograms of 8825 women within a 10-year biennial two-reader screening program. The statistical analysis focused on 5136 mammograms from 4282 women due to data retrieval issues, among whom 105 were diagnosed with breast cancer. The AI software assigned scores from 1 to 100. Histopathology results determined the ground truth, and Youden's index was used to establish a threshold. Tumor characteristics were analyzed with ANOVA and chi-squared test, and different workflow scenarios were evaluated using bootstrapping. The AI software achieved an AUC of 89.6% (86.1-93.2%, 95% CI). The optimal threshold was 30.44, yielding 72.38% sensitivity and 92.86% specificity. Initially, AI identified 57 screening-detected cancers (83.82%), 15 interval cancers (51.72%), and 4 missed cancers (50%). AI as a second reader could have led to earlier diagnosis in 24 patients (average 29.92 ± 19.67 months earlier). No significant differences were found in cancer-characteristics groups. A hybrid triage workflow scenario showed a potential 69.5% reduction in workload and a 30.5% increase in accuracy. This AI system exhibits high sensitivity and specificity in screening mammograms, effectively identifying interval and missed cancers and identifying 23% of cancers earlier in prior mammograms. Adopting AI as a triage mechanism has the potential to reduce workload by nearly 70%. The study proposes a more efficient method for screening programs, both in terms of workload and accuracy. • Incorporating AI as a triage tool in screening workflow improves sensitivity (72.38%) and specificity (92.86%), enhancing detection rates for interval and missed cancers. • AI-assisted triaging is effective in differentiating low and high-risk cases, reduces radiologist workload, and potentially enables broader screening coverage. • AI has the potential to facilitate early diagnosis compared to human reading.",2214

38376405,Outcomes of Breast Cancer Screening Strategies Based on Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network Estimates.,Radiology,2024,"Background There is ongoing debate about recommendations for breast cancer screening strategies, specifically regarding the frequency of screening and the age at which to initiate screening. Purpose To compare estimates of breast cancer screening outcomes published by the Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network (CISNET) to understand the benefits and risks of different screening scenarios. Materials and Methods Modeling estimates published by CISNET are based on hypothetical cohorts in the United States and compare women, starting at 40 years of age, who do and do not undergo breast cancer screening with mammography. The four scenarios assessed in this study, of multiple possible scenarios, were biennial screening ages 50-74 years (2009 and 2016 U.S. Preventive Services Task Force [USPSTF] recommendations), biennial screening ages 40-74 years (2023 USPSTF draft recommendation), annual screening ages 40-74 years, and annual screening ages 40-79 years. For each scenario, CISNET estimates of median lifetime benefits were compared. Risks that included false-positive screening results per examination and benign biopsies per examination were also calculated and compared. Results Estimates from CISNET 2023 showed that annual screening ages 40-79 years improved breast cancer mortality reduction compared with biennial screening ages 50-74 years and biennial screening ages 40-74 years (41.7%, 25.4%, and 30%, respectively). Annual screening ages 40-79 years averted the most breast cancer deaths (11.5 per 1000) and gained the most life-years (230 per 1000) compared with other screening scenarios (range, 6.7-11.5 per 1000 and 121-230 per 1000, respectively). False-positive screening results per examination were less than 10% for all screening scenarios (range, 6.5%-9.6%) and lowest for annual screening ages 40-79 years (6.5%). Benign biopsies per examination were less than 1.33% for all screening scenarios (range, 0.88%-1.32%) and lowest for annual screening ages 40-79 years (0.88%).

A total of 771 breast cancer patients from two institutions were retrospectively studied. Five-hundred-eighty-one patients from Institution I were divided into a training dataset (n Eleven radiomics features from DWI, ADC, and DCE; one radiomics feature from DWI; and 17 radiomics features from DWI, ADC, and DCE were selected to build three predictive models, respectively. In training, independent validation, and external validation datasets, radiomics models achieved AUCs of 0.809, 0.737, and 0.725 in differentiating HER2-overexpressing from others; 0.779, 0.778, and 0.782 in differentiating HER2-low-expressing from others; and 0.889, 0.867, and 0.813 in differentiating HER2-zero-expressing from others, respectively. Multiparametric MRI-based radiomics model may preoperatively predict HER2 statuses in breast cancer patients. The MRI-based radiomics models could be used to noninvasively identify the new three-classification of HER2 expressing status in breast cancer, which is helpful to the decision-making for HER2-target therapies. • Detecting HER2-overexpressing, HER2-low-expressing, and HER2-zero-expressing status in breast cancer patients is crucial for determining candidates for anti-HER2 therapy. • Radiomics features from multiparametric MRI significantly differed among HER2-overexpressing, HER2-low expressing, and HER2-zero-expressing breast cancers. • Multiparametric MRI-based radiomics could preoperatively evaluate three different HER2-expressing statuses and help to determine potential candidates for anti-HER2 therapy in breast cancer patients.",1834
38358528,Risk of hematologic malignant neoplasms from head CT radiation in children and adolescents presenting with minor head trauma: a nationwide population-based cohort study.,European radiology,2024,"The carcinogenic risks of CT radiation in children and adolescents remain debated. We aimed to assess the carcinogenic risk of CTs performed in children and adolescents with minor head trauma. In this nationwide population-based cohort study, we included 2,411,715 patients of age 0-19 with minor head trauma from 2009 to 2017. We excluded patients with elevated cancer risks or substantial past medical radiation exposure. Patients were categorized into CT-exposed or CT-unexposed group according to claim codes for head CT. The primary outcome was development of hematologic malignant neoplasms. Secondary outcomes included development of malignant solid neoplasms and benign neoplasms in the brain. We measured the incidence rate ratio (IRR) and incidence rate difference (IRD) using G-computation with Poisson regression adjusting for age, sex, hospital setting, and the type of head trauma. Hematologic malignant neoplasms developed in 100 of 216,826 patients during 1,303,680 person-years in the CT-exposed group and in 808 of 2,194,889 patients during 13,501,227 person-years in the CT-unexposed group. For hematologic malignant neoplasms, the IRR was 1.29 (95% CI, 1.03-1.60) and the IRD was 1.71 (95% CI, 0.04-3.37) per 100,000 person-years at risk. The majority of excess hematologic malignant neoplasms were leukemia (IRR, 1.40 [98.3% CI, 1.05-1.87]; IRD, 1.59 [98.3% CI, 0.02-3.16] per 100,000 person-years at risk). There were no between-group differences for secondary outcomes. Radiation exposure from head CTs in children and adolescents with minor head trauma was associated with an increased incidence of hematologic malignant neoplasms. Our study provides a quantitative grasp of the risk conferred by CT examinations in children and adolescents, thereby providing the basis for cost-benefit analyses and evidence-driven guidelines for patient triaging in head trauma. • This nationwide population-based cohort study showed that radiation exposure from head CTs in children and adolescents was associated with a higher incidence of hematologic malignant neoplasms. • The incidence rate of hematologic malignant neoplasms in the CT-exposed group was 29% higher than that in the CT-unexposed group (IRR, 1.29 [95% CI, 1.03-1.60]), and there were approximately 1.7 excess neoplasms per 100,000 person-years at risk in the CT-exposed group (IRD, 1.71 [0.04-3.37]). • Our study provides a quantified grasp of the risk conferred by CT examinations in children and adolescents, while controlling for biases observed in previous studies via specifying CT indication and excluding patients with predisposing conditions for cancer development.",2652
38355986,Artificial intelligence in immunotherapy PET/SPECT imaging.,European radiology,2024,"Immunotherapy has dramatically altered the therapeutic landscape for oncology, but more research is needed to identify patients who are likely to achieve durable clinical benefit and those who may develop unacceptable side effects. We investigated the role of artificial intelligence in PET/SPECT-guided approaches for immunotherapy-treated patients. We performed a scoping review of MEDLINE, CENTRAL, and Embase databases using key terms related to immunotherapy, PET/SPECT imaging, and AI/radiomics through October 12, 2022. Of the 217 studies identified in our literature search, 24 relevant articles were selected. The median (interquartile range) sample size of included patient cohorts was 63 (157). Primary tumors of interest were lung (n = 14/24, 58.3%), lymphoma (n = 4/24, 16.7%), or melanoma (n = 4/24, 16.7%). A total of 28 treatment regimens were employed, including anti-PD-(L)1 (n = 13/28, 46.4%) and anti-CTLA-4 (n = 4/28, 14.3%) monoclonal antibodies. Predictive models were built from imaging features using univariate radiomics (n = 7/24, 29.2%), radiomics (n = 12/24, 50.0%), or deep learning (n = 5/24, 20.8%) and were most often used to prognosticate (n = 6/24, 25.0%) or describe tumor phenotype (n = 5/24, 20.8%). Eighteen studies (75.0%) performed AI model validation. Preliminary results suggest broad potential for the application of AI-guided immunotherapy management after further validation of models on large, prospective, multicenter cohorts. This scoping review describes how artificial intelligence models are built to make predictions based on medical imaging and explores their application specifically in the PET and SPECT examination of immunotherapy-treated cancers. • Immunotherapy has drastically altered the cancer treatment landscape but is known to precipitate response patterns that are not accurately accounted for by traditional imaging methods. • There is an unmet need for better tools to not only facilitate in-treatment evaluation but also to predict, a priori, which patients are likely to achieve a good response with a certain treatment as well as those who are likely to develop side effects. • Artificial intelligence applied to PET/SPECT imaging of immunotherapy-treated patients is mainly used to make predictions about prognosis or tumor phenotype and is built from baseline, pre-treatment images. Further testing is required before a true transition to clinical application can be realized.",2450
38353449,Artificial Intelligence for Breast Ultrasound: ,AJR. American journal of roentgenology,2024,"Breast ultrasound is used in a wide variety of clinical scenarios, including both diagnostic and screening applications. Limitations of ultrasound, however, include its low specificity and, for automated breast ultrasound screening, the time necessary to review whole-breast ultrasound images. As of this writing, four AI tools that are approved or cleared by the FDA address these limitations. Current tools, which are intended to provide decision support for lesion classification and/or detection, have been shown to increase specificity among nonspecialists and to decrease interpretation times. Potential future applications include triage of patients with palpable masses in low-resource settings, preoperative prediction of axillary lymph node metastasis, and preoperative prediction of neoadjuvant chemotherapy response. Challenges in the development and clinical deployment of AI for ultrasound include the limited availability of curated training datasets compared with mammography, the high variability in ultrasound image acquisition due to equipment- and operator-related factors (which may limit algorithm generalizability), and the lack of postimplementation evaluation studies. Furthermore, current AI tools for lesion classification were developed based on 2D data, but diagnostic accuracy could potentially be improved if multimodal ultrasound data were used, such as color Doppler, elastography, cine clips, and 3D imaging.",1442
38345605,Spectral CT vs. diffusion-weighted imaging for the quantitative prediction of pathologic response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in locally advanced gastric cancer.,European radiology,2024,"To compare the performance of spectral CT and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) for predicting pathologic response after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in locally advanced gastric cancer (LAGC). This was a retrospective analysis drawn from a prospective dataset. Sixty-five patients who underwent baseline concurrent triple-phase enhanced spectral CT and DWI-MRI and standard NAC plus radical gastrectomy were enrolled, and those with poor images were excluded. The tumor regression grade (TRG) was the reference standard, and patients were classified as responders (TRG 0 + 1) or non-responders (TRG 2 + 3). Quantitative iodine concentration (IC), normalized IC (nIC), and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) were measured by placing a freehand region of interest manually on the maximal two-dimensional plane. Their differences between responders and non-responders were compared. The performances of significant parameters were evaluated by the receiver operating characteristic analysis. The correlations between parameters and TRG status were explored through Spearman correlation coefficient test. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was adopted to analyze their relationship with patient survival. nICDP and ADC were associated with the TRG and yielded comparable performances for predicting TRG categories, with area under the curve (AUC) of 0.674 and 0.673, respectively. Their combination achieved a significantly increased AUC of 0.770 (p ; 0.05) and was associated with patient disease-free survival, with hazard ratio of 2.508 (1.043-6.029). Spectral CT and DWI were equally useful imaging techniques for predicting pathologic response to NAC in LAGC. The combination of nICDP and ADC gained significant incremental benefits and was related to patient disease-free survival. Spectral CT and DWI-based quantitative measurements are effective markers for predicting the pathologic regression outcomes of locally advanced gastric cancer patients after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. • The pathologic tumor regression grade, the standard criteria for treatment response after neoadjuvant chemotherapy in gastric cancer patients, is difficult to predict early. • The quantitative parameters of normalized iodine concentration at delay phase and apparent diffusion coefficients were correlated with pathologic response; their combination demonstrated incremental benefits and was associated with patient disease-free survival. • Spectral CT and DWI are equally useful imaging modalities for predicting tumor regression grade after neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with locally advanced gastric cancer.",2602

A total of 201 PTMC patients were treated with LA (n = 102) or MWA (n = 99) with single-applicator fixed ablation. The ablation range was determined by contrast-enhanced ultrasound. The ratios of ablation volume, longitudinal diameter, and orthogonal diameter to ablation energy (R The R MWA showed a higher R This study establishes strong connections between ablation energy and ablation range in papillary thyroid microcarcinoma (PTMC) in vivo, possibly contributing to the supplementation of the PTMC Ablation Consensus or Guidelines and providing a scientific basis for choosing clinical ablation parameters in PTMC. • Both microwave ablation (MWA) and laser ablation (LA) have excellent performance on the ablation longitudinal axis (easily exceeding 10 mm) for papillary thyroid microcarcinoma (PTMC). • MWA performed much better than LA on the ablation orthogonal axis. • MWA and LA are expected to achieve complete ablation of ≤ 6.70 mm and ≤ 4.69 mm PTMC separately by single-applicator fixed ablation considering a unilateral 2-mm safe margin.",1221
38337068,Multi-modality radiomics model predicts axillary lymph node metastasis of breast cancer using MRI and mammography.,European radiology,2024,"We aimed to develop a multi-modality model to predict axillary lymph node (ALN) metastasis by combining clinical predictors with radiomic features from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and mammography (MMG) in breast cancer. This model might potentially eliminate unnecessary axillary surgery in cases without ALN metastasis, thereby minimizing surgery-related complications. We retrospectively enrolled 485 breast cancer patients from two hospitals and extracted radiomics features from tumor and lymph node regions on MRI and MMG images. After feature selection, three random forest models were built using the retained features, respectively. Significant clinical factors were integrated with these radiomics models to construct a multi-modality model. The multi-modality model was compared to radiologists' diagnoses on axillary ultrasound and MRI. It was also used to assist radiologists in making a secondary diagnosis on MRI. The multi-modality model showed superior performance with AUCs of 0.964 in the training cohort, 0.916 in the internal validation cohort, and 0.892 in the external validation cohort. It surpassed single-modality models and radiologists' ALN diagnosis on MRI and axillary ultrasound in all validation cohorts. Additionally, the multi-modality model improved radiologists' MRI-based ALN diagnostic ability, increasing the average accuracy from 70.70 to 78.16% for radiologist A and from 75.42 to 81.38% for radiologist B. The multi-modality model can predict ALN metastasis of breast cancer accurately. Moreover, the artificial intelligence (AI) model also assisted the radiologists to improve their diagnostic ability on MRI. The multi-modality model based on both MRI and mammography images allows preoperative prediction of axillary lymph node metastasis in breast cancer patients. With the assistance of the model, the diagnostic efficacy of radiologists can be further improved. • We developed a novel multi-modality model that combines MRI and mammography radiomics with clinical factors to accurately predict axillary lymph node (ALN) metastasis, which has not been previously reported. • Our multi-modality model outperformed both the radiologists' ALN diagnosis based on MRI and axillary ultrasound, as well as single-modality radiomics models based on MRI or mammography. • The multi-modality model can serve as a potential decision support tool to improve the radiologists' ALN diagnosis on MRI.",2436
38334762,Ablative margin quantification using deformable versus rigid image registration in colorectal liver metastasis thermal ablation: a retrospective single-center study.,European radiology,2024,"To investigate the correlation of minimal ablative margin (MAM) quantification using biomechanical deformable (DIR) versus intensity-based rigid image registration (RIR) with local outcomes following colorectal liver metastasis (CLM) thermal ablation. This retrospective single-institution study included consecutive patients undergoing thermal ablation between May 2016 and October 2021. Patients who did not have intraprocedural pre- and post-ablation contrast-enhanced CT images for MAM quantification or follow-up period less than 1 year without residual tumor or local tumor progression (LTP) were excluded. DIR and RIR methods were used to quantify the MAM. The registration accuracy was compared using Dice similarity coefficient (DSC). Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was used to test MAM in predicting local tumor outcomes. A total of 72 patients (mean age 57; 44 men) with 139 tumors (mean diameter 1.5 cm ± 0.8 (SD)) were included. During a median follow-up of 29.4 months, there was one residual unablated tumor and the LTP rate was 17% (24/138). The ranges of DSC were 0.96-0.98 and 0.67-0.98 for DIR and RIR, respectively (p < 0.001). When using DIR, 27 (19%) tumors were partially or totally registered outside the liver, compared to 46 (33%) with RIR. Using DIR versus RIR, the corresponding median MAM was 4.7 mm versus 4.0 mm, respectively (p = 0.5). The AUC in predicting residual tumor and 1-year LTP for DIR versus RIR was 0.89 versus 0.72, respectively (p < 0.001). Ablative margin quantified on intra-procedural CT imaging using DIR method outperformed RIR for predicting local outcomes of CLM thermal ablation. The study supports the role of biomechanical deformable image registration as the preferred image registration method over rigid image registration for quantifying minimal ablative margins using intraprocedural contrast-enhanced CT images. • Accurate and reproducible image registration is a prerequisite for clinical application of image-based ablation confirmation methods. • When compared to intensity-based rigid image registration, biomechanical deformable image registration for minimal ablative margin quantification was more accurate for liver registration using intraprocedural contrast-enhanced CT images. • Biomechanical deformable image registration outperformed intensity-based rigid image registration for predicting local tumor outcomes following colorectal liver metastasis thermal ablation.",2471
38334760,Association of peritumoral region features assessed on breast MRI and prognosis of breast cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,European radiology,2024,"Increasing attention has been given to the peritumoral region. However, conflicting findings have been reported regarding the relationship between peritumoral region features on MRI and the prognosis of breast cancer. To evaluate the relationship between peritumoral region features on MRI and prognosis of breast cancer. A retrospective meta-analysis of observational studies comparing either qualitative or quantitative assessments of peritumoral MRI features on breast cancer with poor prognosis and control subjects was performed for studies published till October 2022. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) or standardized mean differences and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated by using random-effects models. The heterogeneity across the studies was measured using the statistic I Twenty-four studies comprising 1853 breast cancers of poor prognosis and 2590 control participants were included in the analysis. Peritumoral edema was associated with non-luminal breast cancers (OR=3.56; 95%CI: 2.17, 5.83; p=.000), high expression of the Ki-67 index (OR=3.70; 95%CI: 2.41, 5.70; p =.000), high histological grade (OR=5.85; 95%CI: 3.89, 8.80; p=.000), lymph node metastasis (OR=2.83; 95%CI: 1.71, 4.67; p=.000), negative expression of HR (OR=3.15; 95%CI: 2.03, 4.88; p=.000), and lymphovascular invasion (OR=1.72; 95%CI: 1.28, 2.30; p=.000). The adjacent vessel sign was associated with greater odds of breast cancer with poor prognosis (OR=2.02; 95%CI: 1.68, 2.44; p=.000). Additionally, breast cancers with poor prognosis had higher peritumor-tumor ADC ratio (SMD=0.67; 95%CI: 0.54, 0.79; p=.000) and peritumoral ADCmean (SMD=0.29; 95%CI: 0.15, 0.42; p=.000). A peritumoral region of 2-20 mm away from the margin of the tumor is recommended. The presence of peritumoral edema and adjacent vessel signs, higher peritumor-tumor ADC ratio, and peritumoral ADCmean were significantly correlated with poor prognosis of breast cancer. MRI features of the peritumoral region can be used as a non-invasive index for the prognostic evaluation of invasive breast cancer. • Peritumoral edema was positively associated with non-luminal breast cancer, high expression of the Ki-67 index, high histological grade, lymph node metastasis, negative expression of HR, and lymphovascular invasion. • The adjacent vessel sign was associated with greater odds of breast cancers with poor prognosis. • Breast cancers with poor prognosis had higher peritumor-tumor ADC ratio and peritumoral ADCmean.",2482
38329503,Anti-HER2 therapy response assessment for guiding treatment (de-)escalation in early HER2-positive breast cancer using a novel deep learning radiomics model.,European radiology,2024,"Anti-HER2 targeted therapy significantly reduces risk of relapse in HER2 + breast cancer. New measures are needed for a precise risk stratification to guide (de-)escalation of anti-HER2 strategy. A total of 726 HER2 + cases who received no/single/dual anti-HER2 targeted therapies were split into three respective cohorts. A deep learning model (DeepTEPP) based on preoperative breast magnetic resonance (MR) was developed. Patients were scored and categorized into low-, moderate-, and high-risk groups. Recurrence-free survival (RFS) was compared in patients with different risk groups according to the anti-HER2 treatment they received, to validate the value of DeepTEPP in predicting treatment efficacy and guiding anti-HER2 strategy. DeepTEPP was capable of risk stratification and guiding anti-HER2 treatment strategy: DeepTEPP-Low patients (60.5%) did not derive significant RFS benefit from trastuzumab (p = 0.144), proposing an anti-HER2 de-escalation. DeepTEPP-Moderate patients (19.8%) significantly benefited from trastuzumab (p = 0.048), but did not obtain additional improvements from pertuzumab (p = 0.125). DeepTEPP-High patients (19.7%) significantly benefited from dual HER2 blockade (p = 0.045), suggesting an anti-HER2 escalation. DeepTEPP represents a pioneering MR-based deep learning model that enables the non-invasive prediction of adjuvant anti-HER2 effectiveness, thereby providing valuable guidance for anti-HER2 (de-)escalation strategies. DeepTEPP provides an important reference for choosing the appropriate individualized treatment in HER2 + breast cancer patients, warranting prospective validation. We built an MR-based deep learning model DeepTEPP, which enables the non-invasive prediction of adjuvant anti-HER2 effectiveness, thus guiding anti-HER2 (de-)escalation strategies in early HER2-positive breast cancer patients. • DeepTEPP is able to predict anti-HER2 effectiveness and to guide treatment (de-)escalation. • DeepTEPP demonstrated an impressive prognostic efficacy for recurrence-free survival and overall survival. • To our knowledge, this is one of the very few, also the largest study to test the efficacy of a deep learning model extracted from breast MR images on HER2-positive breast cancer survival and anti-HER2 therapy effectiveness prediction.",2300
38319428,A retrospective external validation study of the Birmingham Atypical Cartilage Tumour Imaging Protocol (BACTIP) for the management of solitary central cartilage tumours of the proximal humerus and around the knee.,European radiology,2024,"This study aimed to externally validate the Birmingham Atypical Cartilage Tumour Imaging Protocol (BACTIP) recommendations for differentiation/follow-up of central cartilage tumours (CCTs) of the proximal humerus, distal femur, and proximal tibia and to propose BACTIP adaptations if the results provide new insights. MRIs of 123 patients (45 ± 11 years, 37 men) with an untreated CCT with MRI follow-up (n = 62) or histopathological confirmation (n = 61) were retrospectively/consecutively included and categorised following the BACTIP (2003-2020 / Ghent University Hospital/Belgium). Tumour length and endosteal scalloping differences between enchondroma, atypical cartilaginous tumour (ACT), and high-grade chondrosarcoma (CS II/III/dedifferentiated) were evaluated. ROC-curve analysis for differentiating benign from malignant CCTs and for evaluating the BACTIP was performed. For lesion length and endosteal scalloping, ROC-AUCs were poor and fair-excellent, respectively, for differentiating different CCT groups (0.59-0.69 versus 0.73-0.91). The diagnostic performance of endosteal scalloping and the BACTIP was higher than that of lesion length. A 1° endosteal scalloping cut-off differentiated enchondroma from ACT + high-grade chondrosarcoma with a sensitivity of 90%, reducing the potential diagnostic delay. However, the specificity was 29%, inducing overmedicalisation (excessive follow-up). ROC-AUC of the BACTIP was poor for differentiating enchondroma from ACT (ROC-AUC = 0.69; 95%CI = 0.51-0.87; p = 0.041) and fair-good for differentiation between other CCT groups (ROC-AUC = 0.72-0.81). BACTIP recommendations were incorrect/unsafe in five ACTs and one CSII, potentially inducing diagnostic delay. Eleven enchondromas received unnecessary referrals/follow-up. Although promising as a useful tool for management/follow-up of CCTs of the proximal humerus, distal femur, and proximal tibia, five ACTs and one chondrosarcoma grade II were discharged, potentially inducing diagnostic delay, which could be reduced by adapting BACTIP cut-off values. Mostly, Birmingham Atypical Cartilage Tumour Imaging Protocol (BACTIP) assesses central cartilage tumours of the proximal humerus and the knee correctly. Both when using the BACTIP and when adapting cut-offs, caution should be taken for the trade-off between underdiagnosis/potential diagnostic delay in chondrosarcomas and overmedicalisation in enchondromas. • This retrospective external validation confirms the Birmingham Atypical Cartilage Tumour Imaging Protocol as a useful tool for initial assessment and follow-up recommendation of central cartilage tumours in the proximal humerus and around the knee in the majority of cases. • Using only the Birmingham Atypical Cartilage Tumour Imaging Protocol, both atypical cartilaginous tumours and high-grade chondrosarcomas (grade II, grade III, and dedifferentiated chondrosarcomas) can be misdiagnosed, excluding them from specialist referral and further follow-up, thus creating a potential risk of delayed diagnosis and worse prognosis. • Adapted cut-offs to maximise detection of atypical cartilaginous tumours and high-grade chondrosarcomas, minimise underdiagnosis and reduce potential diagnostic delay in malignant tumours but increase unnecessary referral and follow-up of benign tumours.",3311
38319427,Clinical benefits of MRI-guided freehand biopsy of small focal liver lesions in comparison to CT guidance.,European radiology,2024,"To compare clinical success, procedure time, and complication rates between MRI-guided and CT-guided real-time biopsies of small focal liver lesions (FLL) < 20 mm. A comparison of a prospectively collected MRI-guided cohort (n = 30) to a retrospectively collected CT-guided cohort (n = 147) was performed, in which patients underwent real-time biopsies of small FLL < 20 mm in a freehand technique. In both groups, clinical and periprocedural data, including clinical success, procedure time, and complication rates (classified according to CIRSE guidelines), were analyzed. Wilcoxon rank sum test, Pearson's chi-squared test, and Fisher's exact test were used for statistical analysis. Additionally, propensity score matching (PSM) was performed using the following criteria for direct matching: age, gender, presence of liver cirrhosis, liver lobe, lesion diameter, and skin-to-target distance. The median FLL diameter in the MRI-guided cohort was significantly smaller compared to CT guidance (p < 0.001; 11.0 mm vs. 16.3 mm), while the skin-to-target distance was significantly longer (p < 0.001; 90.0 mm vs. 74.0 mm). MRI-guided procedures revealed significantly higher clinical success compared to CT guidance (p = 0.021; 97% vs. 79%) as well as lower complication rates (p = 0.047; 0% vs. 13%). Total procedure time was significantly longer in the MRI-guided cohort (p < 0.001; 38 min vs. 28 min). After PSM (n = 24/n = 38), MRI-guided procedures still revealed significantly higher clinical success compared to CT guidance (p = 0.039; 96% vs. 74%). Despite the longer procedure time, freehand biopsy of small FLL < 20 mm under MR guidance can be considered superior to CT guidance because of its high clinical success and low complication rates. Biopsy of small liver lesions is challenging due to the size and conspicuity of the lesions on native images. MRI offers higher soft tissue contrast, which translates into a higher success of obtaining enough tissue material with MRI compared to CT-guided biopsies. • Image-guided biopsy of small focal liver lesions (FLL) is challenging due to inadequate visualization, leading to sampling errors and false-negative biopsies. • MRI-guided real-time biopsy of FLL < 20 mm revealed significantly higher clinical success (p = 0.021; 97% vs. 79%) and lower complication rates (p = 0.047; 0% vs. 13%) compared to CT guidance. • Although the procedure time is longer, MRI-guided biopsy can be considered superior for small FLL < 20 mm.",2484

Purpose To compare patient outcomes of HDR brachytherapy and transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) in patients with unresectable HCC. Materials and Methods This multi-institutional retrospective study included consecutive treatment-naive adult patients with unresectable HCC who underwent either HDR brachytherapy or TACE between January 2010 and December 2022. Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were compared between patients matched for clinical and tumor characteristics by propensity score matching. Not all patients who underwent TACE had PFS available; thus, a different set of patients was used for PFS and OS analysis for this treatment. Hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated from Kaplan-Meier survival curves. Results After propensity matching, 150 patients who underwent HDR brachytherapy (median age, 71 years [IQR, 63-77 years]; 117 males) and 150 patients who underwent TACE (OS analysis median age, 70 years [IQR, 63-77 years]; 119 male; PFS analysis median age, 68 years [IQR: 63-76 years]; 119 male) were analyzed.

38319162,Brain Tumor Imaging without Gadolinium-based Contrast Agents: Feasible or Fantasy?,Radiology,2024,"Gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) form the cornerstone of current primary brain tumor MRI protocols at all stages of the patient journey. Though an imperfect measure of tumor grade, GBCAs are repeatedly used for diagnosis and monitoring. In practice, however, radiologists will encounter situations where GBCA injection is not needed or of doubtful benefit. Reducing GBCA administration could improve the patient burden of (repeated) imaging (especially in vulnerable patient groups, such as children), minimize risks of putative side effects, and benefit costs, logistics, and the environmental footprint. On the basis of the current literature, imaging strategies to reduce GBCA exposure for pediatric and adult patients with primary brain tumors will be reviewed. Early postoperative MRI and fixed-interval imaging of gliomas are examples of GBCA exposure with uncertain survival benefits. Half-dose GBCAs for gliomas and T2-weighted imaging alone for meningiomas are among options to reduce GBCA use. While most imaging guidelines recommend using GBCAs at all stages of diagnosis and treatment, non-contrast-enhanced sequences, such as the arterial spin labeling, have shown a great potential. Artificial intelligence methods to generate synthetic postcontrast images from decreased-dose or non-GBCA scans have shown promise to replace GBCA-dependent approaches. This review is focused on pediatric and adult gliomas and meningiomas. Special attention is paid to the quality and real-life applicability of the reviewed literature.",1541
38311703,Key learning on the promise and limitations of MRI in prostate cancer screening.,European radiology,2024,"MRI retains its ability to reduce the harm of prostate biopsies by decreasing biopsy rates and the detection of indolent cancers in population-based screening studies aiming to find clinically significant prostate cancers. Limitations of low positive predictive values and high reader variability in diagnostic performance require optimisations in patient selection, imaging protocols, interpretation standards, diagnostic thresholds, and biopsy methods. Improvements in diagnostic accuracy could come about through emerging technologies like risk calculators and polygenic risk scores to select men for MRI. Furthermore, artificial intelligence and workflow optimisations focused on streamlining the diagnostic pathway, quality control, and assurance measures will improve MRI variability. CLINICAL RELEVANCE STATEMENT: MRI significantly reduces harm in prostate cancer screening, lowering unnecessary biopsies and minimizing the overdiagnosis of indolent cancers. MRI maintains the effective detection of high-grade cancers, thus improving the overall benefit-to-harm ratio in population-based screenings with or without using serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) for patient selection. KEY POINTS: • The use of MRI enables the harm reduction benefits seen in individual early cancer detection to be extended to both risk-stratified and non-stratified prostate cancer screening populations. • MRI limitations include a low positive predictive value and imperfect reader variability, which require standardising interpretations, biopsy methods, and integration into a quality diagnostic pathway. • Current evidence is based on one-time point use of MRI in screening; MRI effectiveness in multiple rounds of screening is not well-documented.",1742
38311701,Radiomics in differential diagnosis of Wilms tumor and neuroblastoma with adrenal location in children.,European radiology,2024,"Machine learning methods can be applied successfully to various medical imaging tasks. Our aim with this study was to build a robust classifier using radiomics and clinical data for preoperative diagnosis of Wilms tumor (WT) or neuroblastoma (NB) in pediatric abdominal CT. This is a single-center retrospective study approved by the Institutional Ethical Board. CT scans of consecutive patients diagnosed with WT or NB admitted to our hospital from January 2005 to December 2021 were evaluated. Three distinct datasets based on clinical centers and CT machines were curated. Robust, non-redundant, high variance, and relevant radiomics features were selected using data science methods. Clinically relevant variables were integrated into the final model. Dice score for similarity of tumor ROI, Cohen's kappa for interobserver agreement among observers, and AUC for model selection were used. A total of 147 patients, including 90 WT (mean age 34.78 SD: 22.06 months; 43 male) and 57 NB (mean age 23.77 SD:22.56 months; 31 male), were analyzed. After binarization at 24 months cut-off, there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups for age (p = .07) and gender (p = .54). CT clinic radiomics combined model achieved an F1 score of 0.94, 0.93 accuracy, and an AUC 0.96. In conclusion, the CT-based clinic-radiologic-radiomics combined model could noninvasively predict WT or NB preoperatively. Notably, that model correctly predicted two patients, which none of the radiologists could correctly predict. This model may serve as a noninvasive preoperative predictor of NB/WT differentiation in CT, which should be further validated in large prospective models. CT-based clinic-radiologic-radiomics combined model could noninvasively predict Wilms tumor or neuroblastoma preoperatively. • CT radiomics features can predict Wilms tumor or neuroblastoma from abdominal CT preoperatively. • Integrating clinic variables may further improve the performance of the model. • The performance of the combined model is equal to or greater than human readers, depending on the lesion size.",2104
38308678,Current status of optoacoustic breast imaging and future trends in clinical application: is it ready for prime time?,European radiology,2024,"Optoacoustic imaging (OAI) is an emerging field with increasing applications in patients and exploratory clinical trials for breast cancer. Optoacoustic imaging (or photoacoustic imaging) employs non-ionizing, laser light to create thermoelastic expansion in tissues and detect the resulting ultrasonic emission. By combining high optical contrast capabilities with the high spatial resolution and anatomic detail of grayscale ultrasound, OAI offers unique opportunities for visualizing biological function of tissues in vivo. Over the past decade, human breast applications of OAI, including benign/malignant mass differentiation, distinguishing cancer molecular subtype, and predicting metastatic potential, have significantly increased. We discuss the current state of optoacoustic breast imaging, as well as future opportunities and clinical application trends. CLINICAL RELEVANCE STATEMENT: Optoacoustic imaging is a novel breast imaging technique that enables the assessment of breast cancer lesions and tumor biology without the risk of ionizing radiation exposure, intravenous contrast, or radionuclide injection. KEY POINTS: • Optoacoustic imaging (OAI) is a safe, non-invasive imaging technique with thriving research and high potential clinical impact. • OAI has been considered a complementary tool to current standard breast imaging techniques. • OAI combines parametric maps of molecules that absorb light and scatter acoustic waves (like hemoglobin, melanin, lipids, and water) with anatomical images, facilitating scalable and real-time molecular evaluation of tissues.",1585
38308013,Value of radiological depth of invasion in non-pT4 Oral tongue squamous cell carcinoma: implication for preoperative MR T-staging.,European radiology,2024,"The prognostic stratification for oral tongue squamous cell carcinoma (OTSCC) is heavily based on postoperative pathological depth of invasion (pDOI). This study aims to propose a preoperative MR T-staging system based on tumor size for non-pT4 OTSCC. Retrospectively, 280 patients with biopsy-confirmed, non-metastatic, pT1-3 OTSCC, treated between January 2010 and December 2017, were evaluated. Multiple MR sequences, including axial T2-weighted imaging (WI), unenhanced T1WI, and axial, fat-suppressed coronal, and sagittal contrast-enhanced (CE) T1WI, were utilized to measure radiological depth of invasion (rDOI), tumor thickness, and largest diameter. Intra-class correlation (ICC) and univariate and multivariate analyses were used to evaluate measurement reproducibility, and factors' significance, respectively. Cutoff values were established using an exhaustive method. Intra-observer (ICC = 0.81-0.94) and inter-observer (ICC = 0.79-0.90) reliability were excellent for rDOI measurements, and all measurements were significantly associated with overall survival (OS) (all p < .001). Measuring the rDOI on axial CE-T1WI with cutoffs of 8 mm and 12 mm yielded an optimal MR T-staging system for rT1-3 disease (5-year OS of rT1 vs rT2 vs rT3: 94.0% vs 72.8% vs 57.5%). Using multivariate analyses, the proposed T-staging exhibited increasingly worse OS (hazard ratio of rT2 and rT3 versus rT1, 3.56 [1.35-9.6], p = .011; 4.33 [1.59-11.74], p = .004; respectively), which outperformed pathological T-staging based on nonoverlapping Kaplan-Meier curves and improved C-index (0.682 vs. 0.639, p < .001). rDOI is a critical predictor of OTSCC mortality and facilitates preoperative prognostic stratification, which should be considered in future oral subsite MR T-staging. Utilizing axial CE-T1WI, an MR T-staging system for non-pT4 OTSCC was developed by employing rDOI measurement with optimal thresholds of 8 mm and 12 mm, which is comparable with pathological staging and merits consideration in future preoperative oral subsite planning. • Tumor morphology, measuring sequences, and observers could impact MR-derived measurements and compromise the consistency with histology. • MR-derived measurements, including radiological depth of invasion (rDOI), tumor thickness, and largest diameter, have a prognostic impact on OS (all p < .001). • rDOI with cutoffs of 8 mm and 12 mm on axial CE-T1WI is an optimal predictor of OS and could facilitate risk stratification in non-pT4 OTSCC disease.",2501
38308012,Quality assessment of the MRI-radiomics studies for MGMT promoter methylation prediction in glioma: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,European radiology,2024,"To evaluate the methodological quality and diagnostic accuracy of MRI-based radiomic studies predicting O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation status in gliomas. PubMed Medline, EMBASE, and Web of Science were searched to identify MRI-based radiomic studies on MGMT methylation in gliomas published until December 31, 2022. Three raters evaluated the study methodological quality with Radiomics Quality Score (RQS, 16 components) and Transparent Reporting of a Multivariable Prediction Model for Individual Prognosis Or Diagnosis (TRIPOD, 22 items) scales. Risk of bias and applicability concerns were assessed with QUADAS-2 tool. A meta-analysis was performed to estimate the pooled area under the curve (AUC) and to assess inter-study heterogeneity. We included 26 studies, published from 2016. The median RQS total score was 8 out of 36 (22%, range 8-44%). Thirteen studies performed external validation. All studies reported AUC or accuracy, but only 4 (15%) performed calibration and decision curve analysis. No studies performed phantom analysis, cost-effectiveness analysis, and prospective validation. The overall TRIPOD adherence score was between 50% and 70% in 16 studies and below 50% in 10 studies. The pooled AUC was 0.78 (95% CI, 0.73-0.83, I Study RQS and adherence to TRIPOD guidelines was generally low. Radiomic prediction of MGMT methylation status showed great heterogeneity of results and lower performances in grade IV gliomas, which hinders its current implementation in clinical practice. MGMT promoter methylation status appears to be variably correlated with MRI radiomic features; radiomic models are not sufficiently robust to be integrated into clinical practice to accurately predict MGMT promoter methylation status in patients with glioma before surgery. • Adherence to the indications of TRIPOD guidelines was generally low, as was RQS total score. • MGMT promoter methylation status prediction with MRI radiomic features provided heterogeneous diagnostic accuracy results across studies. • Studies that included grade IV glioma only and performed external validation had significantly lower diagnostic accuracy than others.",2186
38300293,Development and multicenter validation of deep convolutional neural network-based detection of colorectal cancer on abdominal CT.,European radiology,2024,"This study aims to develop computer-aided detection (CAD) for colorectal cancer (CRC) using abdominal CT based on a deep convolutional neural network. This retrospective study included consecutive patients with colorectal adenocarcinoma who underwent abdominal CT before CRC resection surgery (training set = 379, test set = 103). We customized the 3D U-Net of nnU-Net (CUNET) for CRC detection, which was trained with fivefold cross-validation using annotated CT images. CUNET was validated using datasets covering various clinical situations and institutions: an internal test set (n = 103), internal patients with CRC first determined by CT (n = 54) and asymptomatic CRC (n = 51), and an external validation set from two institutions (n = 60). During each validation, data from the healthy population were added (internal = 60; external = 130). CUNET was compared with other deep CNNs: residual U-Net and EfficientDet. The CAD performances were evaluated using per-CRC sensitivity (true positive/all CRCs), free-response receiver operating characteristic (FROC), and jackknife alternative FROC (JAFROC) curves. CUNET showed a higher maximum per-CRC sensitivity than residual U-Net and EfficientDet (internal test set 91.3% vs. 61.2%, and 64.1%). The per-CRC sensitivity of CUNET at false-positive rates of 3.0 was as follows: internal CRC determined by CT, 89.3%; internal asymptomatic CRC, 87.3%; and external validation, 89.6%. CUNET detected 69.2% (9/13) of CRCs missed by radiologists and 89.7% (252/281) of CRCs from all validation sets. CUNET can detect CRC on abdominal CT in patients with various clinical situations and from external institutions. • Customized 3D U-Net of nnU-Net (CUNET) can be applied to the opportunistic detection of colorectal cancer (CRC) in abdominal CT, helping radiologists detect unexpected CRC. • CUNET showed the best performance at false-positive rates ≥ 3.0, and 30.1% of false-positives were in the colorectum. CUNET detected 69.2% (9/13) of CRCs missed by radiologists and 87.3% (48/55) of asymptomatic CRCs. • CUNET detected CRCs in multiple validation sets composed of varying clinical situations and from different institutions, and CUNET detected 89.7% (252/281) of CRCs from all validation sets.",2245
38289210,Natural History of Colorectal Polyps Undergoing Longitudinal in Vivo CT Colonography Surveillance.,Radiology,2024,"Background The natural history of colorectal polyps is not well characterized due to clinical standards of care and other practical constraints limiting in vivo longitudinal surveillance. Established CT colonography (CTC) clinical screening protocols allow surveillance of small (6-9 mm) polyps. Purpose To assess the natural history of colorectal polyps followed with CTC in a clinical screening program, with histopathologic correlation for resected polyps. Materials and Methods In this retrospective study, CTC was used to longitudinally monitor small colorectal polyps in asymptomatic adult patients from April 1, 2004, to August 31, 2020. All patients underwent at least two CTC examinations. Polyp growth patterns across multiple time points were analyzed, with histopathologic context for resected polyps. Regression analysis was performed to evaluate predictors of advanced histopathology. Results In this study of 475 asymptomatic adult patients (mean age, 56.9 years ± 6.7 [SD]; 263 men), 639 unique polyps (mean initial diameter, 6.3 mm; volume, 50.2 mm",1065
38282078,Differentiating IDH-mutant astrocytomas and 1p19q-codeleted oligodendrogliomas using DSC-PWI: high performance through cerebral blood volume and percentage of signal recovery percentiles.,European radiology,2024,"Presurgical differentiation between astrocytomas and oligodendrogliomas remains an unresolved challenge in neuro-oncology. This research aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of each tumor's DSC-PWI signatures, evaluate the discriminative capacity of cerebral blood volume (CBV) and percentage of signal recovery (PSR) percentile values, and explore the synergy of CBV and PSR combination for pre-surgical differentiation. Patients diagnosed with grade 2 and 3 IDH-mutant astrocytomas and IDH-mutant 1p19q-codeleted oligodendrogliomas were retrospectively retrieved (2010-2022). 3D segmentations of each tumor were conducted, and voxel-level CBV and PSR were extracted to compute mean, minimum, maximum, and percentile values. Statistical comparisons were performed using the Mann-Whitney U test and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC). Lastly, the five most discriminative variables were combined for classification with internal cross-validation. The study enrolled 52 patients (mean age 45-year-old, 28 men): 28 astrocytomas and 24 oligodendrogliomas. Oligodendrogliomas exhibited higher CBV and lower PSR than astrocytomas across all metrics (e.g., mean CBV = 2.05 and 1.55, PSR = 0.68 and 0.81 respectively). The highest AUC-ROCs and the smallest p values originated from CBV and PSR percentiles (e.g., PSRp70 AUC-ROC = 0.84 and p value = 0.0005, CBVp75 AUC-ROC = 0.8 and p value = 0.0006). The mean, minimum, and maximum values yielded lower results. Combining the best five variables (PSRp65, CBVp70, PSRp60, CBVp75, and PSRp40) achieved a mean AUC-ROC of 0.87 for differentiation. Oligodendrogliomas exhibit higher CBV and lower PSR than astrocytomas, traits that are emphasized when considering percentiles rather than mean or extreme values. The combination of CBV and PSR percentiles results in promising classification outcomes. The combination of histogram-derived percentile values of cerebral blood volume and percentage of signal recovery from DSC-PWI enhances the presurgical differentiation between astrocytomas and oligodendrogliomas, suggesting that incorporating these metrics into clinical practice could be beneficial. • The unsupervised selection of percentile values for cerebral blood volume and percentage of signal recovery enhances presurgical differentiation of astrocytomas and oligodendrogliomas. • Oligodendrogliomas exhibit higher cerebral blood volume and lower percentage of signal recovery than astrocytomas. • Cerebral blood volume and percentage of signal recovery combined provide a broader perspective on tumor vasculature and yield promising results for this preoperative classification.",2670
38277241,Development of a [89Zr]Zr-labeled Human Antibody using a Novel Phage-displayed Human scFv Library.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,2024,"Tax-interacting protein 1 (TIP1) is a cancer-specific radiation-inducible cell surface antigen that plays a role in cancer progression and resistance to therapy. This study aimed to develop a novel anti-TIP1 human antibody for noninvasive PET imaging in patients with cancer. A phage-displayed single-chain variable fragment (scFv) library was created from healthy donors' blood. High-affinity anti-TIP1 scFvs were selected from the library and engineered to human IgG1. Purified Abs were characterized by size exclusion chromatography high-performance liquid chromatography (SEC-HPLC), native mass spectrometry (native MS), ELISA, BIAcore, and flow cytometry. The labeling of positron emitter [89Zr]Zr to the lead Ab, L111, was optimized using deferoxamine (DFO) chelator. The stability of [89Zr]Zr-DFO-L111 was assessed in human serum. Small animal PET studies were performed in lung cancer tumor models (A549 and H460). We obtained 95% pure L111 by SEC-HPLC. Native MS confirmed the intact mass and glycosylation pattern of L111. Conjugation of three molar equivalents of DFO led to the optimal DFO-to-L111 ratio of 1.05. Radiochemical purity of 99.9% and specific activity of 0.37 MBq/μg was obtained for [89Zr]Zr-DFO-L111. [89Zr]Zr-DFO-L111 was stable in human serum over 7 days. The immunoreactive fraction in cell surface binding studies was 96%. In PET, preinjection with 4 mg/kg cold L111 before [89Zr]Zr-DFO-L111 (7.4 MBq; 20 μg) significantly (P < 0.01) enhanced the tumor-to-muscle standard uptake values (SUVmax) ratios on day 5 compared with day 2 postinjection. L111 Ab targets lung cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. [89Zr]Zr-DFO-L111 is a human antibody that will be evaluated in the first in-human study of safety and PET imaging.",1748
38276982,Prediction of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status in breast cancer by mammographic radiomics features and clinical characteristics: a multicenter study.,European radiology,2024,"To preoperatively evaluate the human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2) status in breast cancer using mammographic radiomics features and clinical characteristics on a multi-vendor and multi-center basis. This multi-center study included a cohort of 1512 Chinese female with invasive ductal carcinoma of no special type (IDC-NST) from two different hospitals and five devices (1332 from Institution A, used for training and testing the models, and 180 women from Institution B, as the external validation cohort). The Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) was employed to establish radiomics and multiomics models. Model efficacy was evaluated by the area under the curve (AUC). The number of HER2-positive patients in the training, testing, and external validation cohort were 245(26.3%), 105 (26.3.8%), and 51(28.3%), respectively, with no statistical differences among the three cohorts (p = 0.842, chi-square test). The radiomics model, based solely on the radiomics features, achieved an AUC of 0.814 (95% CI, 0.784-0.844) in the training cohort, 0.776 (95% CI, 0.727-0.825) in the testing cohort, and 0.702 (95% CI, 0.614-0.790) in the external validation cohort. The multiomics model, incorporated radiomics features with clinical characteristics, consistently outperformed the radiomics model with AUC values of 0.838 (95% CI, 0.810-0.866) in the training cohort, 0.788 (95% CI, 0.741-0.835) in the testing cohort, and 0.722 (95% CI, 0.637-0.811) in the external validation cohort. Our study demonstrates that a model based on radiomics features and clinical characteristics has the potential to accurately predict HER2 status of breast cancer patients across multiple devices and centers. By predicting the HER2 status of breast cancer reliably, the presented model built upon radiomics features and clinical characteristics on a multi-vendor and multi-center basis can help in bolstering the model's applicability and generalizability in real-world clinical scenarios. • The mammographic presentation of breast cancer is closely associated with the status of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). • The radiomics model, based solely on radiomics features, exhibits sub-optimal performance in the external validation cohort. • By combining radiomics features and clinical characteristics, the multiomics model can improve the prediction ability in external data.",2374
38265473,Evaluation of tumor microvasculature with 3D ultrasound localization microscopy based on 2D matrix array.,European radiology,2024,"Evaluation of tumor microvascular morphology is of great significance in tumor diagnosis, therapeutic effect prediction, and surgical planning. Recently, two-dimensional ultrasound localization microscopy (2DULM) has demonstrated its superiority in the field of microvascular imaging. However, it suffers from planar dependence and is unintuitive. We propose a novel three-dimensional ultrasound localization microscopy (3DULM) to avoid these limitations. We investigated 3DULM based on a 2D array for tumor microvascular imaging. After intravenous injection of contrast agents, all elements of the 2D array transmit and receive signals to ensure a high and stable frame rate. Microbubble signal extraction, filtering, positioning, tracking, and other processing were used to obtain a 3D vascular map, flow velocity, and flow direction. To verify the effectiveness of 3DULM, it was validated on double helix tubes and rabbit VX2 tumors. Cisplatin was used to verify the ability of 3DULM to detect microvascular changes during tumor treatment. In vitro, the sizes measured by 3DULM at 3 mm and 13 mm were 178  The effectiveness of 3DULM was verified in vitro and in vivo. Hence, 3DULM may have potential applications in tumor diagnosis, tumor treatment evaluation, surgical protocol guidance, and cardiovascular disease. 3D ultrasound localization microscopy is highly sensitive to microvascular changes; thus, it has clinical potential for tumor diagnosis and treatment evaluation. • 3D ultrasound localization microscopy is demonstrated on double helix tubes and rabbit VX2 tumors. • 3D ultrasound localization microscopy can reveal vessels about 30 ",1651
38263597,FDG PET/CT Imaging 1 Week after a Single Dose of Pembrolizumab Predicts Treatment Response in Patients with Advanced Melanoma.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,2024,"Immunologic response to anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) therapy can occur rapidly with T-cell responses detectable in as little as one week. Given that activated immune cells are FDG avid, we hypothesized that an early FDG PET/CT obtained approximately 1 week after starting pembrolizumab could be used to visualize a metabolic flare (MF), with increased tumor FDG activity due to infiltration by activated immune cells, or a metabolic response (MR), due to tumor cell death, that would predict response. Nineteen patients with advanced melanoma scheduled to receive pembrolizumab were prospectively enrolled. FDG PET/CT imaging was performed at baseline and approximately 1 week after starting treatment. FDG PET/CT scans were evaluated for changes in maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) and thresholds were identified by ROC analysis; MF was defined as >70% increase in tumor SUVmax, and MR as >30% decrease in tumor SUVmax. An MF or MR was identified in 6 of 11 (55%) responders and 0 of 8 (0%) nonresponders, with an objective response rate (ORR) of 100% in the MF-MR group and an ORR of 38% in the stable metabolism (SM) group. An MF or MR was associated with T-cell reinvigoration in the peripheral blood and immune infiltration in the tumor. Overall survival at 3 years was 83% in the MF-MR group and 62% in the SM group. Median progression-free survival (PFS) was >38 months (median not reached) in the MF-MR group and 2.8 months (95% confidence interval, 0.3-5.2) in the SM group (P = 0.017). Early FDG PET/CT can identify metabolic changes in melanoma metastases that are potentially predictive of response to pembrolizumab and significantly correlated with PFS.",1691

MAITA is a consortium of four Italian trials, REtomo, Proteus, Impeto, and MAITA trial. The trials adopted a two-arm randomised design comparing DBT plus DM (REtomo and Proteus) or synthetic-2D (Impeto and MAITA trial) versus DM; multiple vendors were included. Women aged 45 to 69 years were individually randomised to one round of DBT or DM. From March 2014 to February 2022, 50,856 and 63,295 women were randomised to the DBT and DM arm, respectively. In the DBT arm, 6656 women were screened with DBT plus synthetic-2D. Recall was higher in the DBT arm (5·84% versus 4·96%), with differences between centres. With DBT, 0·8/1000 (95% CI 0·3 to 1·3) more women received surgical treatment for a benign lesion. The detection rate was 51% higher with DBT, ie. 2·6/1000 (95% CI 1·7 to 3·6) more cancers detected, with a similar relative increase for invasive cancers and ductal carcinoma in situ. The results were similar below and over the age of 50, at first and subsequent rounds, and with DBT plus DM and DBT plus synthetic-2D. No learning curve was appreciable. Detection of cancers >= 20 mm, with 2 or more positive lymph nodes, grade III, HER2-positive, or triple-negative was similar in the two arms. Results from MAITA confirm that DBT is superior to DM for the detection of cancers, with a possible increase in recall rate. DBT performance in screening should be assessed locally while waiting for long-term follow-up results on the impact of advanced cancer incidence.",1602
38259203,Assessment of Background Parenchymal Enhancement at Dynamic Contrast-enhanced MRI in Predicting Breast Cancer Recurrence Risk.,Radiology,2024,"Background Background parenchymal enhancement (BPE) at dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI of cancer-free breasts increases the risk of developing breast cancer; implications of quantitative BPE in ipsilateral breasts with breast cancer are largely unexplored. Purpose To determine whether quantitative BPE measurements in one or both breasts could be used to predict recurrence risk in women with breast cancer, using the Oncotype DX recurrence score as the reference standard. Materials and Methods This HIPAA-compliant retrospective single-institution study included women diagnosed with breast cancer between January 2007 and January 2012 (development set) and between January 2012 and January 2017 (internal test set). Quantitative BPE was automatically computed using an in-house-developed computer algorithm in both breasts. Univariable logistic regression was used to examine the association of BPE with Oncotype DX recurrence score binarized into high-risk (recurrence score >25) and low- or intermediate-risk (recurrence score ≤25) categories. Models including BPE measures were assessed for their ability to distinguish patients with high risk versus those with low or intermediate risk and the actual recurrence outcome. Results The development set included 127 women (mean age, 58 years ± 10.2 [SD]; 33 with high risk and 94 with low or intermediate risk) with an actual local or distant recurrence rate of 15.7% (20 of 127) at a minimum 10 years of follow-up. The test set included 60 women (mean age, 57.8 years ± 11.6; 16 with high risk and 44 with low or intermediate risk).

38243135,Deep learning-based multimodal segmentation of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma on CT and MRI using self-configuring nnU-Net.,European radiology,2024,"To evaluate deep learning-based segmentation models for oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) using CT and MRI with nnU-Net. This single-center retrospective study included 91 patients with OPSCC. The patients were grouped into the development (n = 56), test 1 (n = 13), and test 2 (n = 22) cohorts. In the development cohort, OPSCC was manually segmented on CT, MR, and co-registered CT-MR images, which served as the ground truth. The multimodal and multichannel input images were then trained using a self-configuring nnU-Net. For evaluation metrics, dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and mean Hausdorff distance (HD) were calculated for test cohorts. Pearson's correlation and Bland-Altman analyses were performed between ground truth and prediction volumes. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) of radiomic features were calculated for reproducibility assessment. All models achieved robust segmentation performances with DSC of 0.64 ± 0.33 (CT), 0.67 ± 0.27 (MR), and 0.65 ± 0.29 (CT-MR) in test cohort 1 and 0.57 ± 0.31 (CT), 0.77 ± 0.08 (MR), and 0.73 ± 0.18 (CT-MR) in test cohort 2. No significant differences were found in DSC among the models. HD of CT-MR (1.57 ± 1.06 mm) and MR models (1.36 ± 0.61 mm) were significantly lower than that of the CT model (3.48 ± 5.0 mm) (p = 0.037 and p = 0.014, respectively). The correlation coefficients between the ground truth and prediction volumes for CT, MR, and CT-MR models were 0.88, 0.93, and 0.9, respectively. MR models demonstrated excellent mean ICCs of radiomic features (0.91-0.93). The self-configuring nnU-Net demonstrated reliable and accurate segmentation of OPSCC on CT and MRI. The multimodal CT-MR model showed promising results for the simultaneous segmentation on CT and MRI. Deep learning-based automatic detection and segmentation of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma on pre-treatment CT and MRI would facilitate radiologic response assessment and radiotherapy planning. • The nnU-Net framework produced a reliable and accurate segmentation of OPSCC on CT and MRI. • MR and CT-MR models showed higher DSC and lower Hausdorff distance than the CT model. • Correlation coefficients between the ground truth and predicted segmentation volumes were high in all the three models.",2267
38243134,"Are dilution, slow injection and care bolus technique the causal solution to mitigating arterial-phase artifacts on gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI? A large-cohort study.",European radiology,2024,"Arterial-phase artifacts are gadoxetic acid (GA)-enhanced MRI's major drawback, ranging from 5 to 39%. We evaluate the effect of dilution and slow injection of GA using automated fluoroscopic triggering on liver MRI arterial-phase (AP) acquisition timing, artifact frequency, and lesion visibility. Saline-diluted 1:1 GA was injected at 1 ml/s into 1413 patients for 3 T liver MRI. Initially, one senior abdominal radiologist, i.e., principal investigator (PI), assessed all MR exams and compared them to previous and follow-up images, as well as the radiology report on record, determining the standard of reference for lesion detection and characterization. Then, three other readers independently evaluated the AP images for artifact type (truncation (TA), transient severe motion (TSM) or mixed), artifact severity (on a 5-point scale), acquisition timing (on a 4-point scale) and visibility (on a 5-point scale) of hypervascular lesions ≥ 5 mm, selected by the PI. Artifact score ≥ 4 and artifact score ≤ 3 were considered significant and non-significant artifacts, respectively. Of the 1413 exams, diagnostic-quality arterial-phase images included 1100 (77.8%) without artifacts, 220 (15.6%) with minimal, and 77 (5.4%) with moderate artifacts. Only 16 exams (1.1%) had significant artifacts, 13 (0.9%) with severe artifacts (score 4), and three (0.2%) non-diagnostic artifacts (score 5). AP acquisition timing was optimal in 1369 (96.8%) exams. Of the 449 AP hypervascular lesions, 432 (96.2%) were detected. Combined dilution and slow injection of GA with MR results in well-timed arterial-phase images in 96.8% and a reduction of exams with significant artifacts to 1.1%. Hypervascular lesions, in particular HCC detection, hinge on arterial-phase hyperenhancement, making well-timed, artifact-free arterial-phase images a prerequisite for accurate diagnosis. Saline dilution 1:1, slow injection (1 ml/s), and automated bolus triggering reduce artifacts and optimize acquisition timing. • There was substantial agreement among the three readers regarding the presence and type of arterial-phase (AP) artifacts, acquisition timing, and lesion visibility. • Impaired AP hypervascular lesion visibility occurred in 17 (3.8%) cases; in eight lesions due to mistiming and in nine lesions due to significant artifacts. • When AP timing was suboptimal, it was too late in 40 exams (3%) and too early in 4 exams (0.2%) of exams.",2429
38240805,Diagnostic performance of 3D automated breast ultrasound (3D-ABUS) in a clinical screening setting-a retrospective study.,European radiology,2024,"To assess the diagnostic performance of 3D automated breast ultrasound (3D-ABUS) in breast cancer screening in a clinical setting. All patients who had 3D-ABUS between January 2014 and January 2022 for screening were included in this retrospective study. The images were reported by 1 of 6 breast radiologists based on the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data Systems (BI-RADS). The 3D-ABUS was reviewed together with the digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT). Recall rate, biopsy rate, positive predictive value (PPV) and cancer detection yield were calculated. In total, 3616 studies were performed in 1555 women (breast density C/D 95.5% (n = 3455/3616), breast density A/B 4.0% (n = 144/3616), density unknown (0.5% (n = 17/3616)). A total of 259 lesions were detected on 3D-ABUS (87.6% (n = 227/259) masses and 12.4% (n = 32/259) architectural distortions). The recall rate was 5.2% (n = 188/3616) (CI 4.5-6.0%) with only 36.7% (n = 69/188) cases recalled to another date. Moreover, recall declined over time. There were 3.4% (n = 123/3616) biopsies performed, with 52.8% (n = 65/123) biopsies due to an abnormality detected in 3D-ABUS alone. Ten of 65 lesions were malignant, resulting in a positive predictive value (PPV) of 15.4% (n = 10/65) (CI 7.6-26.5%)). The cancer detection yield of 3D-ABUS is 2.77 per 1000 screening tests (CI 1.30-5.1). The cancer detection yield of 3D-ABUS in a real clinical screening setting is comparable to the results reported in previous prospective studies, with lower recall and biopsy rates. 3D-ABUS also may be an alternative for screening when mammography is not possible or declined. 3D automated breast ultrasound screening performance in a clinical setting is comparable to previous prospective studies, with better recall and biopsy rates. • 3D automated breast ultrasound is a reliable and reproducible tool that provides a three-dimensional representation of the breast and allows image visualisation in axial, coronal and sagittal. • The diagnostic performance of 3D automated breast ultrasound in a real clinical setting is comparable to its performance in previously published prospective studies, with improved recall and biopsy rates. • 3D automated breast ultrasound is a useful adjunct to mammography in dense breasts and may be an alternative for screening when mammography is not possible or declined.",2355
38227202,Current use and future perspectives of contrast-enhanced mammography (CEM): a survey by the European Society of Breast Imaging (EUSOBI).,European radiology,2024,"To perform a survey among members of the European Society of Breast Imaging (EUSOBI) regarding the use of contrast-enhanced mammography (CEM). A panel of nine board-certified radiologists developed a 29-item online questionnaire, distributed to all EUSOBI members (inside and outside Europe) from January 25 to March 10, 2023. CEM implementation, examination protocols, reporting strategies, and current and future CEM indications were investigated. Replies were exploratively analyzed with descriptive and non-parametric statistics. Among 434 respondents (74.9% from Europe), 50% (217/434) declared to use CEM, 155/217 (71.4%) seeing less than 200 CEMs per year. CEM use was associated with academic settings and high breast imaging workload (p < 0.001). The lack of CEM adoption was most commonly due to the perceived absence of a clinical need (65.0%) and the lack of resources to acquire CEM-capable systems (37.3%). CEM protocols varied widely, but most respondents (61.3%) had already adopted the 2022 ACR CEM BI-RADS® lexicon. CEM use in patients with contraindications to MRI was the most common current indication (80.6%), followed by preoperative staging (68.7%). Patients with MRI contraindications also represented the most commonly foreseen CEM indication (88.0%), followed by the work-up of inconclusive findings at non-contrast examinations (61.5%) and supplemental imaging in dense breasts (53.0%). Respondents declaring CEM use and higher CEM experience gave significantly more current (p = 0.004) and future indications (p < 0.001). Despite a trend towards academic high-workload settings and its prevalent use in patients with MRI contraindications, CEM use and progressive experience were associated with increased confidence in the technique. In this first survey on contrast-enhanced mammography (CEM) use and perspectives among the European Society of Breast Imaging (EUSOBI) members, the perceived absence of a clinical need chiefly drove the 50% CEM adoption rate. CEM adoption and progressive experience were associated with more extended current and future indications. • Among the 434 members of the European Society of Breast Imaging who completed this survey, 50% declared to use contrast-enhanced mammography in clinical practice. • Due to the perceived absence of a clinical need, contrast-enhanced mammography (CEM) is still prevalently used as a replacement for MRI in patients with MRI contraindications. • The number of current and future CEM indications marked by respondents was associated with their degree of CEM experience.",2564

To retrospectively evaluate the diagnostic performance and safety of computed tomography (CT)-guided percutaneous core needle biopsy of head and neck masses. This retrospective single-center study included patients from 04/2007 to 12/2021, and a total of 156 core needle biopsies were evaluated. The initial histopathological results were compared with the long-term final diagnosis to evaluate the diagnostic yield of CT-guided core needle biopsies. The patients' age, sex, and history of malignancy, as well as procedural complications and radiation exposure were collected. A total of 156 biopsies of 150 patients (mean age 56 years ± 17; 89 men) were evaluated. 57.3% (86/150) of patients had a history of malignancy. 55.1% (86/156) of the lesions were accessed by an infrahyoid needle approach. 92.9% (145/156) of biopsies yielded conclusive results. There were no false positives and 4 false negatives, resulting in a total false negative rate of 2.7% (4/145) and a total diagnostic yield of 90.4% (141/156). There were nine puncture-related complications (9/156-5.7%). None of the complications required further reintervention. The average dose length product was 311.3 mGy × cm. CT-guided core needle biopsies of head and neck masses showed excellent results with high diagnostic yield and clinical safety. General anesthesia for open biopsy carries a higher risk for elderly patients, and fine needle aspiration has a poor reputation in terms of its diagnostic yield. This study focuses on safety and diagnostic yield of CT-guided core needle biopsies. • CT-guided core needle biopsy in head and neck tumors was a reliable and safe procedure. • The most common cause for an inconclusive biopsy result was a shortage of tissue collected during the biopsy. • During our study period of nearly 15 years, the radiation exposure of head and neck biopsies decreased.",2055

The purpose of NCT01479686 was to prove whether intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging (iMRI) increases EOR in glioma surgery and benefit survival. Patients were randomized (1:1) to receive the iMRI (n = 161) or the conventional neuronavigation (n = 160). The primary endpoint was gross total resection (GTR); secondary outcomes reported were progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and safety. 188 high-grade gliomas (HGGs) and 133 low-grade gliomas (LGGs) were enrolled. GTR was 83.85% in the iMRI group vs. 50.00% in the control group (P < 0.0001). In 321 patients, the median PFS (mPFS) was 65.12 months in the iMRI group and 61.01 months in the control group (P = 0.0202). For HGGs, mPFS was improved in the iMRI group (19.32 vs. 13.34 months, P = 0.0015), and a trend of superior OS compared with control was observed (29.73 vs. 25.33 months, P = 0.1233).

This retrospective study included hepatocellular carcinoma patients from an institutional database with portal venous MRI. After manual segmentation, the data was randomly split into independent training, validation, and internal testing sets. From a collaborating institution, de-identified scans were used for external testing. The public LiverHccSeg dataset was used for further external validation. A 3D DCNN was trained to automatically segment the liver. Segmentation accuracy was quantified by the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) with respect to manual segmentation. A Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare the internal and external test sets. Agreement of volumetry and radiomic features was assessed using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). In total, 470 patients met the inclusion criteria (63.9±8.2 years; 376 males) and 20 patients were used for external validation (41±12 years; 13 males). DSC segmentation accuracy of the DCNN was similarly high between the internal (0.97±0.01) and external (0.96±0.03) test sets (p=0.28) and demonstrated robust segmentation performance on public testing (0.93±0.03). Agreement of liver volumetry was satisfactory in the internal (ICC, 0.99), external (ICC, 0.97), and public (ICC, 0.85) test sets. Radiomic features demonstrated excellent agreement in the internal (mean ICC, 0.98±0.04), external (mean ICC, 0.94±0.10), and public (mean ICC, 0.91±0.09) datasets. Automated liver segmentation yields robust and generalizable segmentation performance on MRI data and can be used for volumetry and radiomic feature extraction. Liver volumetry, anatomic localization, and extraction of quantitative imaging biomarkers require accurate segmentation, but manual segmentation is time-consuming. A deep convolutional neural network demonstrates fast and accurate segmentation performance on T1-weighted portal venous MRI. • This deep convolutional neural network yields robust and generalizable liver segmentation performance on internal, external, and public testing data. • Automated liver volumetry demonstrated excellent agreement with manual volumetry. • Automated liver segmentations can be used for robust and reproducible radiomic feature extraction.",2434
38206403,Machine learning model to preoperatively predict T2/T3 staging of laryngeal and hypopharyngeal cancer based on the CT radiomic signature.,European radiology,2024,"To develop and assess a radiomics-based prediction model for distinguishing T2/T3 staging of laryngeal and hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LHSCC) METHODS: A total of 118 patients with pathologically proven LHSCC were enrolled in this retrospective study. We performed feature processing based on 851 radiomic features derived from contrast-enhanced CT images and established multiple radiomic models by combining three feature selection methods and seven machine learning classifiers. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were used to assess the performance of the models. The radiomic signature obtained from the optimal model and statistically significant morphological image characteristics were incorporated into the predictive nomogram. The performance of the nomogram was assessed by calibration curve and decision curve analysis. Using analysis of variance (ANOVA) feature selection and logistic regression (LR) classifier produced the best model. The AUCs of the training, validation, and test sets were 0.919, 0.857, and 0.817, respectively. A nomogram based on the model integrating the radiomic signature and a morphological imaging characteristic (suspicious thyroid cartilage invasion) exhibited C-indexes of 0.899 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.843-0.955), fitting well in calibration curves (p > 0.05). Decision curve analysis further confirmed the clinical usefulness of the nomogram. The nomogram based on the radiomics model derived from contrast-enhanced CT images had good diagnostic performance for distinguishing T2/T3 staging of LHSCC. Accurate T2/T3 staging assessment of LHSCC aids in determining whether laryngectomy or laryngeal preservation therapy should be performed. The nomogram based on the radiomics model derived from contrast-enhanced CT images has the potential to predict the T2/T3 staging of LHSCC, which can provide a non-invasive and robust approach for guiding the optimization of clinical decision-making. • Combining analysis of variance with logistic regression yielded the optimal radiomic model. • A nomogram based on the CT-radiomic signature has good performance for differentiating T2 from T3 staging of laryngeal and hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma. • It provides a non-invasive and robust approach for guiding the optimization of clinical decision-making.",2391

A total of 7,856 healthy postmenopausal women were screened annually for a total of 50,596 woman-years in a single-arm study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00539162). Serum CA125 was analyzed with the Risk of Ovarian Cancer Algorithm (ROCA) each year. If risk was unchanged and <1:2,000, women returned in a year. If risk increased above 1:500, TVS was undertaken immediately, and if risk was intermediate, CA125 was repeated in 3 months with a further increase in risk above 1:500 prompting referral for TVS. An average of 2% of participants were referred to TVS annually. Thirty-four patients were referred for operations detecting 15 ovarian cancers and two borderline tumors with 12 in early stage (I-II). In addition, seven endometrial cancers were detected with six in stage I. As four ovarian cancers and two borderline tumors were diagnosed with a normal ROCA, the sensitivity for detecting ovarian and borderline cancer was 74% (17 of 23), and 70% of ROCA-detected cases (12 of 17) were in stage I-II. NROSS screening reduced late-stage (III-IV) disease by 34% compared with UKCTOCS controls and by 30% compared with US SEER values. The positive predictive value (PPV) was 50% (17 of 34) for detecting ovarian cancer and 74% (25 of 34) for any cancer, far exceeding the minimum acceptable study end point of 10% PPV. While the NROSS trial was not powered to detect reduced mortality, the high specificity, PPV, and marked stage shift support further development of this strategy.",1784

However, there is a lack of studies focused on small subpleural NSCLCs (≤30 mm). Purpose To identify CT features predictive of VPI in patients with subpleural NSCLCs 30 mm or smaller. Materials and Methods This study is a retrospective review of patients enrolled in the Initiative for Early Lung Cancer Research on Treatment (IELCART) at Mount Sinai Hospital between July 2014 and February 2023. Subpleural nodules 30 mm or smaller were classified into two groups: a pleural-attached group and a pleural-tag group. Preoperative CT features suggestive of VPI were evaluated for each group separately. Multivariable logistic regression analysis adjusted for sex, age, nodule size, and smoking status was used to determine predictive factors for VPI. Model performance was analyzed with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), and models were compared using Akaike information criterion (AIC). Results Of 379 patients with NSCLC with subpleural nodules, 37 had subsolid nodules and 342 had solid nodules. Eighty-eight patients (22%) had documented VPI, all in solid nodules. Of the 342 solid nodules (46% in male patients, 54% in female patients; median age, 71 years; IQR: 66, 76), 226 were pleural-attached nodules and 116 were pleural-tag nodules.

Oncology,2024,"Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) response criteria have been established and were updated in 2023 for MRI-based response evaluation of diffuse gliomas in clinical trials. In addition, PET-based imaging with amino acid tracers is increasingly considered for disease monitoring in both clinical practice and clinical trials. So far, a standardised framework defining timepoints for baseline and follow-up investigations and response evaluation criteria for PET imaging of diffuse gliomas has not been established. Therefore, in this Policy Review, we propose a set of criteria for response assessment based on amino acid PET imaging in clinical trials enrolling participants with diffuse gliomas as defined in the 2021 WHO classification of tumours of the central nervous system. These proposed PET RANO criteria provide a conceptual framework that facilitates the structured implementation of PET imaging into clinical research and, ultimately, clinical routine. To this end, the PET RANO 1.0 criteria are intended to encourage specific investigations of amino acid PET imaging of gliomas.",1100

The interval cancer rate and interval cancer characteristics of the study population included in the Córdoba Breast Tomosynthesis Screening Trial (CBTST) were compared to a contemporary control population screened with DM. The tumour characteristics of screen-detected and interval cancers were also compared. Contingency tables were used to compare interval cancer rates. The chi-square test and Fisher's exact test were used to compare the qualitative characteristics of the cancers whereas Student's t test and the Mann-Whitney U test were used to analyse quantitative features. A total of 16,068 screening exams with DBT + DM were conducted within the CBTST (mean age 57.59 ± 5.9 [SD]) between January 2015 and December 2016 (study population). In parallel, 23,787 women (mean age 58.89 ± 5.9 standard deviation [SD]) were screened with DM (control population). The interval cancer rate was lower in the study population than in the control population (15 [0.93‰; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.73, 1.14] vs 43 [1.8‰; 95% CI: 1.58, 2.04] respectively; p = 0.045). The difference in rate was more marked in women with dense breasts (0.95‰ in the study population vs 3.17‰ in the control population; p = 0.031). Interval cancers were smaller in the study population than in the control population (p = 0.031). The interval cancer rate was lower in women screened with DBT + DM compared to those screened with DM alone. These differences were more pronounced in women with dense breasts. Women screened using tomosynthesis and digital mammography had a lower rate of interval cancer than women screened with digital mammography, with the greatest difference in the interval cancer rate observed in women with dense breasts. • The interval cancer rate was lower in the study population (digital breast tomosynthesis [DBT] + digital mammography [DM]) than in the control population (DM). • The difference in interval cancer rates was more pronounced in women with dense breasts. • Interval cancers were smaller in the study population (DBT + DM) than in the control population (DM).",2293

This retrospective, multicenter, observational study included 222 patients (mean age 66, range 46-75 years) who underwent prostate MRI, miRNA (let-7a-5p and miR-103a-3p) assessment, and biopsy. Monoparametric and multiparametric models including age, PSA, miRNA, and MRI outcome were trained on 65% of the data and then validated on the remaining 35% to predict both PCa (any Gleason grade [GG]) and csPCa (GG ≥ 2 vs GG = 1/negative). Accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value (NPV), and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve were calculated. MRI outcome was the best predictor in the monoparametric model for both detection of PCa, with sensitivity of 90% (95%CI 73-98%) and NPV of 93% (95%CI 82-98%), and for csPCa identification, with sensitivity of 91% (95%CI 72-99%) and NPV of 95% (95%CI 84-99%). Sensitivity and NPV of PSA + miRNA for the detection of csPCa were not statistically different from the other models including MRI alone. MRI stand-alone yielded the best prediction models for both PCa and csPCa detection in biopsy-naïve patients. The use of miRNAs let-7a-5p and miR-103a-3p did not improve classification performances compared to MRI stand-alone results. The use of miRNA (let-7a-5p and miR-103a-3p), PSA, and MRI in a clinical decision support system (CDSS) does not improve MRI stand-alone performance in the detection of PCa and csPCa. • Clinical decision support systems including MRI improve the detection of both prostate cancer and clinically significant prostate cancer with respect to PSA test and/or microRNA. • The use of miRNAs let-7a-5p and miR-103a-3p did not significantly improve MRI stand-alone performance. • Results of this study were in line with previous works on MRI and microRNA.",2087
38171488,Early detection of nasopharyngeal carcinoma: performance of a short contrast-free screening magnetic resonance imaging.,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,2024,"Although contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) detects early-stage nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) not detected by endoscopic-guided biopsy (EGB), a short contrast-free screening MRI would be desirable for NPC screening programs. This study evaluated a screening MRI in a plasma Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-DNA NPC screening program. EBV-DNA-screen-positive patients underwent endoscopy, and endoscopy-positive patients underwent EGB. EGB was negative if the biopsy was negative or was not performed. Patients also underwent a screening MRI. Diagnostic performance was based on histologic confirmation of NPC in the initial study or during a follow-up period of at least 2 years. The study prospectively recruited 354 patients for MRI and endoscopy; 40/354 (11.3%) endoscopy-positive patients underwent EGB. Eighteen had NPC (5.1%), and 336 without NPC (94.9%) were followed up for a median of 44.8 months. MRI detected additional NPCs in 3/18 (16.7%) endoscopy-negative and 2/18 (11.1%) EGB-negative patients (stage I/II, n = 4; stage III, n = 1). None of the 24 EGB-negative patients who were MRI-negative had NPC. MRI missed NPC in 2/18 (11.1%), one of which was also endoscopy-negative. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy of MRI, endoscopy, and EGB were 88.9%, 91.1%, 34.8%, 99.4%, and 91.0%; 77.8%, 92.3%, 35.0%, 98.7%, and 91.5%; and 66.7%, 92.3%, 31.6%, 98.1%, and 91.0%, respectively. A quick contrast-free screening MRI complements endoscopy in NPC screening programs.

38165432,Manual prostate MRI segmentation by readers with different experience: a study of the learning progress.,European radiology,2024,"To evaluate the learning progress of less experienced readers in prostate MRI segmentation. One hundred bi-parametric prostate MRI scans were retrospectively selected from the Göteborg Prostate Cancer Screening 2 Trial (single center). Nine readers with varying degrees of segmentation experience were involved: one expert radiologist, two experienced radiology residents, two inexperienced radiology residents, and four novices. The task was to segment the whole prostate gland. The expert's segmentations were used as reference. For all other readers except three novices, the 100 MRI scans were divided into five rounds (cases 1-10, 11-25, 26-50, 51-76, 76-100). Three novices segmented only 50 cases (three rounds). After each round, a one-on-one feedback session between the expert and the reader was held, with feedback on systematic errors and potential improvements for the next round. Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) > 0.8 was considered accurate. Using DSC > 0.8 as the threshold, the novices had a total of 194 accurate segmentations out of 250 (77.6%). The residents had a total of 397/400 (99.2%) accurate segmentations. In round 1, the novices had 19/40 (47.5%) accurate segmentations, in round 2 41/60 (68.3%), and in round 3 84/100 (84.0%) indicating learning progress. Radiology residents, regardless of prior experience, showed high segmentation accuracy. Novices showed larger interindividual variation and lower segmentation accuracy than radiology residents. To prepare datasets for artificial intelligence (AI) development, employing radiology residents seems safe and provides a good balance between cost-effectiveness and segmentation accuracy. Employing novices should only be considered on an individual basis. Employing radiology residents for prostate MRI segmentation seems safe and can potentially reduce the workload of expert radiologists. Employing novices should only be considered on an individual basis. • Using less experienced readers for prostate MRI segmentation is cost-effective but may reduce quality. • Radiology residents provided high accuracy segmentations while novices showed large inter-reader variability. • To prepare datasets for AI development, employing radiology residents seems safe and might provide a good balance between cost-effectiveness and segmentation accuracy while novices should only be employed on an individual basis.",2389
38165430,Reader bias in breast cancer screening related to cancer prevalence and artificial intelligence decision support-a reader study.,European radiology,2024,"The aim of our study was to examine how breast radiologists would be affected by high cancer prevalence and the use of artificial intelligence (AI) for decision support. This reader study was based on selection of screening mammograms, including the original radiologist assessment, acquired in 2010 to 2013 at the Karolinska University Hospital, with a ratio of 1:1 cancer versus healthy based on a 2-year follow-up. A commercial AI system generated an exam-level positive or negative read, and image markers. Double-reading and consensus discussions were first performed without AI and later with AI, with a 6-week wash-out period in between. The chi-squared test was used to test for differences in contingency tables. Mammograms of 758 women were included, half with cancer and half healthy. 52% were 40-55 years; 48% were 56-75 years. In the original non-enriched screening setting, the sensitivity was 61% (232/379) at specificity 98% (323/379). In the reader study, the sensitivity without and with AI was 81% (307/379) and 75% (284/379) respectively (p < 0.001). The specificity without and with AI was 67% (255/379) and 86% (326/379) respectively (p < 0.001). The tendency to change assessment from positive to negative based on erroneous AI information differed between readers and was affected by type and number of image signs of malignancy. Breast radiologists reading a list with high cancer prevalence performed at considerably higher sensitivity and lower specificity than the original screen-readers. Adding AI information, calibrated to a screening setting, decreased sensitivity and increased specificity. Radiologist screening mammography assessments will be biased towards higher sensitivity and lower specificity by high-risk triaging and nudged towards the sensitivity and specificity setting of AI reads. After AI implementation in clinical practice, there is reason to carefully follow screening metrics to ensure the impact is desired. • Breast radiologists' sensitivity and specificity will be affected by changes brought by artificial intelligence. • Reading in a high cancer prevalence setting markedly increased sensitivity and decreased specificity. • Reviewing the binary reads by AI, negative or positive, biased screening radiologists towards the sensitivity and specificity of the AI system.",2326
38165250,Radiologic Features of Nodules Attached to the Mediastinal or Diaphragmatic Pleura at Low-Dose CT for Lung Cancer Screening.,Radiology,2024,"Background Pulmonary noncalcified nodules (NCNs) attached to the fissural or costal pleura with smooth margins and triangular or lentiform, oval, or semicircular (LOS) shapes at low-dose CT are recommended for annual follow-up instead of immediate workup. Purpose To determine whether management of mediastinal or diaphragmatic pleura-attached NCNs (M/DP-NCNs) with the same features as fissural or costal pleura-attached NCNs at low-dose CT can follow the same recommendations. Materials and Methods This retrospective study reviewed chest CT examinations in participants from two databases. Group A included 1451 participants who had lung cancer that was first present as a solid nodule with an average diameter of 3.0-30.0 mm. Group B included 345 consecutive participants from a lung cancer screening program who had at least one solid nodule with a diameter of 3.0-30.0 mm at baseline CT and underwent at least three follow-up CT examinations. Radiologists reviewed CT images to identify solid M/DP-NCNs, defined as nodules 0 mm in distance from the mediastinal or diaphragmatic pleura, and recorded average diameter, margin, and shape. General descriptive statistics were used. Results Among the 1451 participants with lung cancer in group A, 163 participants (median age, 68 years [IQR, 61.5-75.0 years]; 92 male participants) had 164 malignant M/DP-NCNs 3.0-30.0 mm in average diameter. None of the 164 malignant M/DP-NCNs had smooth margins and triangular or LOS shapes (upper limit of 95% CI of proportion, 0.02). Among the 345 consecutive screening participants in group B, 146 participants (median age, 65 years [IQR, 59-71 years]; 81 female participants) had 240 M/DP-NCNs with average diameter 3.0-30.0 mm. None of the M/DP-NCNs with smooth margins and triangular or LOS shapes were malignant after a median follow-up of 57.8 months (IQR, 46.3-68.1 months). Conclusion For solid M/DP-NCNs with smooth margins and triangular or LOS shapes at low-dose CT, the risk of lung cancer is extremely low, which supports the recommendation of Lung Imaging Reporting and Data System version 2022 for annual follow-up instead of immediate workup. © RSNA, 2024 See also the editorial by Goodman and Baruah in this issue.",2221
38153744,The Potential of Genetics in Identifying Women at Lower Risk of Breast Cancer.,JAMA oncology,2024,"Genetic information is not being used to identify women at lower risk of breast cancer or other diseases in clinical practice. With the new US Preventive Services Task Force guidelines lowering the age for mammogram screening for all, there is a potential benefit in identifying women at lower risk of disease who may defer the start of mammographic screening. This genetic risk-based approach would help mitigate overscreening, associated costs, and anxiety. To assess breast cancer incidence and age of onset among women at low genetic risk compared with women at average risk and evaluate the potential to delay mammography on the basis of genetic risk stratification. This retrospective case-control study included 25 591 women from the Healthy Nevada Project sequenced by Helix between 2018 and 2022. Data extracted from electronic health records at the end of 2022 (mean length of electronic health record available was 12 years) were used for the analysis in 2023. Breast cancer diagnosis was identified from electronic health records. Classification to the low-risk genetic group required (1) the absence of pathogenic variants or a variant of uncertain significance in BRCA1, BRCA2, PALB2, ATM, or CHEK2, and (2) a low polygenic risk score (bottom 10%) using a 313-single-nucleotide variant model. Of 25 591 women in the study (mean [SD] age was 53.8 [16.9] years), 2338 women (9.1%) were classified as having low risk for breast cancer; 410 women (1.6%) were classified as high risk; and 22 843 women (89.3%) as average risk. There was a significant reduction in breast cancer diagnosis among the low-risk group (hazard ratio, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.29-0.52; P < .001). By 45 years of age, 0.69% of women in the average-risk group were diagnosed with breast cancer, whereas women in the low-risk group reached this rate at 51 years. By 50 years of age, 1.41% of those in the average-risk group were diagnosed with breast cancer, whereas those in the low-risk group reached this rate at age 58 years. These findings suggest that deferring mammogram screening by 5 to 10 years for women at low risk of breast cancer aligns with new draft recommendations. The findings of this retrospective case-control study underscore the value of genetics in individualizing the onset of breast cancer screening. Improving breast cancer risk stratification by implementing both high-risk and low-risk strategies in screening can refine preventive measures and optimize health care resource allocation.",2488
38133675,A conditional inference tree model for predicting cancer risk of non-mass lesions detected on breast ultrasound.,European radiology,2024,"To generate and validate a prediction model based on imaging features for cancer risk of non-mass lesions (NMLs) detected on breast ultrasound (US). In this single-center study, consecutive women with 503 NMLs detected on breast US between 2012 and 2019 were retrospectively identified. The lesions were randomly assigned to the training or testing dataset with a 70/30 split. Age, symptoms, lesion size, and US features were collected. Multivariate analyses were employed to identify risk factors associated with malignancy. The predictive model was developed by using conditional inference trees (CTREE). There were 498 patients (50.9 ± 13.29 years; range, 22-88 years) with 503 NMLs with histopathologic results or > 2-year follow-up, including 224 (44.5%) benign and 279 (55.5%) malignant lesions. At multivariate analysis, age (odds ratio (OR) = 1.08, 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.06-1.11, p < 0.001), NMLs with focal mass effect (OR = 3.03, 95% CI, 1.59-5.81, p = 0.001), indistinct glandular-fat interface (GFI) (OR = 4.23, 95% CI, 2.31-7.73, p < 0.001), geographic (OR = 3.47, 95% CI, 1.20-10.8, p = 0.022) and mottled (OR = 3.67, 95% CI, 1.32-10.21, p = 0.013) patterns, and calcifications (OR = 2.15, 95% CI, 1.16-4.01, p = 0.016) were associated with malignancy. The GFI status, architectural patterns, general morphology, and calcifications were consistently identified as the strongest US predictors of malignancy using CTREE analysis. Based on these factors, individuals were stratified into six risk groups. The predictive model showed an area under the curve of 0.797 in the testing dataset. The CTREE model efficiently aids in interpreting and managing ultrasound-detected breast NMLs, overcoming BI-RADS limitations by refining cancer risk stratification. The CTREE model allows for the reclassification of BI-RADS categories into subgroups with varying malignancy probabilities, thus providing a valuable enhancement to the BI-RADS assessment for the diagnosis of ultrasound-detected NMLs, with the potential to minimize unnecessary biopsies. • The indistinct glandular-fat interface (GFI) status, NML with focal mass effect, geographic or mottled patterns, and calcifications are the strongest imaging predictors of malignant non-mass lesions (NMLs) detected on breast US. • A practical system has been created to categorize NMLs found in breast US; each classification is associated with a degree of diagnostic certainty. • The model may contribute to patient stratification by determining the relative likelihood of malignancy and thus support clinical decision-making and evidence-based management.",2624

This retrospective study divided 749 patients with PBTs or bone infections from two hospitals into a training set (N = 557), an internal validation set (N = 139), and an external validation set (N = 53). The ensemble framework was constructed using T1-weighted image (T1WI), T2-weighted image (T2WI), and clinical characteristics for binary (PBTs/bone infections) and three-category (benign/intermediate/malignant PBTs) classification. The detection and segmentation performances were evaluated using Intersection over Union (IoU) and Dice score. The classification performance was evaluated using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and compared with radiologist interpretations. On the external validation set, the single T1WI-based and T2WI-based multi-task models obtained IoUs of 0.71 ± 0.25/0.65 ± 0.30 for detection and Dice scores of 0.75 ± 0.26/0.70 ± 0.33 for segmentation. The framework achieved AUCs of 0.959 (95%CI, 0.955-1.000)/0.900 (95%CI, 0.773-0.100) and accuracies of 90.6% (95%CI, 79.7-95.9%)/78.3% (95%CI, 58.1-90.3%) for the binary/three-category classification. Meanwhile, for the three-category classification, the performance of the framework was superior to that of three junior radiologists (accuracy: 65.2%, 69.6%, and 69.6%, respectively) and comparable to that of two senior radiologists (accuracy: 78.3% and 78.3%). The MRI-based ensemble multi-task framework shows promising performance in automatically and simultaneously detecting, segmenting, and classifying PBTs and bone infections, which was preferable to junior radiologists. Compared with junior radiologists, the ensemble multi-task deep learning framework effectively improves differential diagnosis for patients with primary bone tumors or bone infections. This finding may help physicians make treatment decisions and enable timely treatment of patients. • The ensemble framework fusing multi-parametric MRI and clinical characteristics effectively improves the classification ability of single-modality models. • The ensemble multi-task deep learning framework performed well in detecting, segmenting, and classifying primary bone tumors and bone infections. • The ensemble framework achieves an optimal classification performance superior to junior radiologists' interpretations, assisting the clinical differential diagnosis of primary bone tumors and bone infections.",2616

Radiomics models were constructed via the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method. The performances of models were evaluated by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). In addition, genetic analyses were conducted to reveal the underlying biological basis of the radiomics score. After the LASSO process, 9 PET-CT radiomics features were selected for pCR prediction. In the validation cohort, the ability of PET-CT radiomics model to predict pCR was shown to have an AUC of 0.818 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.711, 0.925), which was better than the PET radiomics model (0.728 [95% CI, 0.610, 0.846]), CT radiomics model (0.732 [95% CI, 0.607, 0.857]), and maximum standard uptake value (0.603 [95% CI, 0.473, 0.733]) (p < 0.05). Moreover, a high radiomics score was related to the upregulation of pathways suppressing tumor proliferation and the infiltration of antitumor immune cell.

38114849,Deep learning for malignancy risk estimation of incidental sub-centimeter pulmonary nodules on CT images.,European radiology,2024,"To establish deep learning models for malignancy risk estimation of sub-centimeter pulmonary nodules incidentally detected by chest CT and managed in clinical settings. Four deep learning models were trained using CT images of sub-centimeter pulmonary nodules from West China Hospital, internally tested, and externally validated on three cohorts. The four models respectively learned 3D deep features from the baseline whole lung region, baseline image patch where the nodule located, baseline nodule box, and baseline plus follow-up nodule boxes. All regions of interest were automatically segmented except that the nodule boxes were additionally manually checked. The performance of models was compared with each other and that of three respiratory clinicians. There were 1822 nodules (981 malignant) in the training set, 806 (416 malignant) in the testing set, and 357 (253 malignant) totally in the external sets. The area under the curve (AUC) in the testing set was 0.754, 0.855, 0.928, and 0.942, respectively, for models derived from baseline whole lung, image patch, nodule box, and the baseline plus follow-up nodule boxes. When baseline models externally validated (follow-up images not available), the nodule-box model outperformed the other two with AUC being 0.808, 0.848, and 0.939 respectively in the three external datasets. The resident, junior, and senior clinicians achieved an accuracy of 67.0%, 82.5%, and 90.0%, respectively, in the testing set. The follow-up model performed comparably to the senior clinician. The deep learning algorithms solely mining nodule information can efficiently predict malignancy of incidental sub-centimeter pulmonary nodules. The established models may be valuable for supporting clinicians in routine clinical practice, potentially reducing the number of unnecessary examinations and also delays in diagnosis. • According to different regions of interest, four deep learning models were developed and compared to evaluate the malignancy of sub-centimeter pulmonary nodules by CT images. • The models derived from baseline nodule box or baseline plus follow-up nodule boxes demonstrated sufficient diagnostic accuracy (86.4% and 90.4% in the testing set), outperforming the respiratory resident (67.0%) and junior clinician (82.5%). • The proposed deep learning methods may aid clinicians in optimizing follow-up recommendations for sub-centimeter pulmonary nodules and may lead to fewer unnecessary diagnostic interventions.",2480
38114848,Safety and efficacy of CT-guided percutaneous microwave ablation for stage I non-small cell lung cancer in patients with comorbid idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.,European radiology,2024,"To evaluate the safety and efficacy of microwave ablation (MWA) for stage I non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). A retrospective single-center cohort study was conducted in patients with clinical stage I NSCLC who underwent CT-guided MWA from Nov 2016 to Oct 2021. The patients were divided into the IPF group and the non-IPF group. The primary endpoints were 90-day adverse events and hospital length of stay (HLOS). The secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). A total of 107 patients (27 with IPF and 80 without IPF) were finally included for analysis. No procedure-related acute exacerbation of IPF or death occurred post-MWA. The rates of adverse events were similar between the groups (48.6% vs. 47.7%; p = 0.998). The incidence of grade 3 adverse events in the IPF group was higher than that in the non-IPF group without a significant difference (13.5% vs. 4.6%; p = 0.123). Median HLOS was 5 days in both groups without a significant difference (p = 0.078). The 1-year and 3-year OS were 85.2%/51.6% in the IPF group, and 97.5%/86.4% in the non-IPF group. The survival of patients with IPF was significantly poorer than the survival of patients without IPF (p < 0.001). There was no significant difference for PFS (p = 0.271). MWA was feasible in the treatment of stage I NSCLC in patients with IPF. IPF had an adverse effect on the survival of stage I NSCLC treated with MWA. CT-guided microwave ablation is a well-tolerated and effective potential alternative treatment for stage I non-small cell lung cancer in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. • Microwave ablation for stage I non-small cell lung cancer was well-tolerated without procedure-related acute exacerbation of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and death in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. • No differences were observed in the incidence of adverse events between patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and those without idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis after microwave ablation (48.6% vs. 47.7%; p = 0.998). • The 1-year and 3-year overall survival rates (85.2%/51.6%) in the idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis group were worse than those in the non- idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis group (97.5%/86.4%) (p < 0.001).",2302

This retrospective study included 60 patients with surgically proven IPNB who had undergone preoperative MRI between January 2007 and December 2020. All surgical specimens were reviewed retrospectively to classify types 1 and 2 IPNBs and assess tumor grade. Significant MRI features for differentiating type 2 (n = 40) from type 1 IPNB (n = 20); and for IPNB with an associated invasive carcinoma (n = 43) from intraepithelial neoplasia (n = 17) were determined using logistic regression analysis. An associated invasive carcinoma was more frequently found in type 2 than in type 1 IPNB (85.0% [34/40] vs. 45.0% [9/20], p = 0.003). At univariable analysis, MRI features including extrahepatic location, no dilatation of tumor-bearing segment of bile duct, isolated upstream bile duct dilatation, and single lesion were associated with type 2 IPNB (all p ≤ 0.012). At multivariable analysis, significant MRI findings for differentiating type 2 from type 1 IPNB were extrahepatic location and no dilatation of tumor-bearing segment of bile duct (odds ratio [OR], 7.24 and 46.40, respectively). At univariable and multivariable analysis, tumor size ≥ 2.5 cm (OR, 8.45), bile duct wall thickening (OR, 4.82), and irregular polypoid or nodular tumor shape (OR, 6.44) were significant MRI features for differentiating IPNB with an associated invasive carcinoma from IPNB with intraepithelial neoplasia. MRI with MR cholangiopancreatography may be helpful in differentiating type 2 IPNB from type 1 IPNB and assessing malignant potential of IPNB. Preoperative MRI with MR cholangiopancreatography may be helpful in differentiating type 2 intraductal papillary neoplasms of bile duct (IPNB) from type 1 IPNB and assessing malignant potential of IPNB. • In terms of tumor grade, the incidence of invasive carcinoma was significantly higher in type 2 intraductal papillary neoplasm of the bile duct (IPNB) than in type 1 IPNB. • At MRI, extrahepatic location and no dilatation of tumor-bearing segment are significant features for differentiating type 2 IPNBs from type 1 IPNBs. • At MRI, large tumor size, bile duct wall thickening, and irregular polypoid or nodular tumor shape are significant features for differentiating IPNB with an associated invasive carcinoma from IPNB with intraepithelial neoplasia.",2458

This retrospective study included 120 women (age range, 18-82 years; mean, 52 years) scheduled for ultrasound-guided biopsy. With the aid of brightness-mode images, the border of each breast lesion was delineated in the CEUS images. Based on visual evaluation and quantitative metrics, the breast lesions were categorized into four grades of different levels of contrast enhancement. Grade-1 (hyper-enhanced) and grade-2 (partly-enhanced) breast lesions were included in the analysis. Four parameters reflecting enhancement heterogeneity were estimated by spatiotemporal analysis of neighboring time-intensity curves (TICs). By setting the threshold on mean parameter, the diagnostic performance of the four parameters for differentiating benign and malignant lesions was evaluated. Sixty-four of the 120 patients were categorized as grade 1 or 2 and used for estimating the four parameters. At the pixel level, mutual information and conditional entropy present significantly different values between the benign and malignant lesions (p < 0.001 in patients of grade 1, p = 0.002 in patients of grade 1 or 2). For the classification of breast lesions, mutual information produces the best diagnostic performance (AUC = 0.893 in patients of grade 1, AUC = 0.848 in patients of grade 1 or 2). The proposed spatiotemporal analysis for assessing the enhancement heterogeneity shows promising results to aid in the diagnosis of breast cancer by CEUS. The proposed spatiotemporal method can be developed as a standardized software to automatically quantify the enhancement heterogeneity of breast cancer on CEUS, possibly leading to the improved diagnostic accuracy of differentiation between benign and malignant lesions. • Advanced spatiotemporal analysis of ultrasound contrast-enhanced loops for aiding the differentiation of malignant or benign breast lesions. • Four parameters reflecting the enhancement heterogeneity were estimated in the hyper- and partly-enhanced breast lesions by analyzing the neighboring pixel-level time-intensity curves. • For the classification of hyper-enhanced breast lesions, mutual information produces the best diagnostic performance (AUC = 0.893).",2405

Single-site data suggest that rLI-RADS category 5 (rLR-5) improves sensitivity while maintaining positive predictive value (PPV) of the LI-RADS v2018 category 5 (LR-5), which indicates definite HCC. Purpose To compare the diagnostic performance of LI-RADS v2018 and rLI-RADS in a multicenter data set of patients at risk for HCC by performing an individual patient data meta-analysis. Materials and Methods Multiple databases were searched for studies published from January 2014 to January 2022 that evaluated the diagnostic performance of any version of LI-RADS at CT or MRI for diagnosing HCC. An individual patient data meta-analysis method was applied to observations from the identified studies. Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies version 2 was applied to determine study risk of bias. Observations were categorized according to major features and either LI-RADS v2018 or rLI-RADS assignments. Diagnostic accuracies of category 5 for each system were calculated using generalized linear mixed models and compared using the likelihood ratio test for sensitivity and the Wald test for PPV. Results Twenty-four studies, including 3840 patients and 4727 observations, were analyzed.

However, the emphasis on specificity can result in disease understaging, potentially leading to poorer posttransplant outcomes. Purpose To determine the negative predictive value (NPV) of pretransplant CT and MRI assessment for viable HCC on a per-patient basis using the LI-RADS TRA, considering explant pathology as the reference standard. Materials and Methods Patient records from 218 consecutive adult patients from a single institution with HCC who underwent liver transplant from January 2011 to November 2017 were retrospectively reviewed. Two readers blinded to the original report reviewed immediate (within 90 days) pretransplant imaging and characterized observations according to the LI-RADS TRA. Based on this, patients with LR-4, LR-5, or LR-TR (treatment response) viable tumors were designated as viable tumor; patients with solely LR-3 or LR-TR equivocal tumors were designated as equivocal; and patients with only LR-TR nonviable lesions were designated as no viable disease. Patients were designated as within or outside the Milan criteria. These per-patient designations were compared with the presence of viable disease at explant pathology. Fisher exact test was used to compare the differences between CT and MRI. Weighted κ values were used to calculate interreader reliability. Results Final study sample consisted of 206 patients (median age, 61 years [IQR, 57-65 years]; 157 male patients and 49 female patients). Per-patient LI-RADS TRA assessment of pretransplant imaging had an NPV of 32% (95% CI: 27, 38) and 26% (95% CI: 20, 33) (readers 1 and 2, respectively) for predicting viable disease. Seventy-five percent (reader 1) and 77% (reader 2) of patients deemed equivocal had residual tumors at explant pathology. Weighted interreader reliability was substantial (κ = 0.62). Conclusion Patient-based stratification of viable, equivocal, and nonviable disease at pretransplant CT or MRI, based on LI-RADS TRA, demonstrated low negative predictive value in excluding HCC at explant pathology. © RSNA, 2023 See also the editorial by Tamir and Tau in this issue.",2348

Recently, we identified CD46 as an overexpressed therapeutic target in multiple myeloma and developed the antibody YS5, which targets a cancer-specific epitope on this protein. We further developed the CD46-targeting PET probe [89Zr]Zr-DFO-YS5 for imaging and [225Ac]Ac-DOTA-YS5 for radiopharmaceutical therapy of prostate cancer. These prior studies suggested the feasibility of the CD46 antigen as a theranostic target in multiple myeloma. Herein, we validate [89Zr]Zr-DFO-YS5 for immunoPET imaging and [225Ac]Ac-DOTA-YS5 for radiopharmaceutical therapy of multiple myeloma in murine models. In vitro saturation binding was performed using the CD46 expressing MM.1S multiple myeloma cell line. ImmunoPET imaging using [89Zr]Zr-DFO-YS5 was performed in immunodeficient (NSG) mice bearing subcutaneous and systemic multiple myeloma xenografts. For radioligand therapy, [225Ac]Ac-DOTA-YS5 was prepared, and both dose escalation and fractionated dose treatment studies were performed in mice bearing MM1.S-Luc systemic xenografts. Tumor burden was analyzed using BLI, and body weight and overall survival were recorded to assess antitumor effect and toxicity. [89Zr]Zr-DFO-YS5 demonstrated high affinity for CD46 expressing MM.1S multiple myeloma cells (Kd = 16.3 nmol/L). In vitro assays in multiple myeloma cell lines demonstrated high binding, and bioinformatics analysis of human multiple myeloma samples revealed high CD46 expression. [89Zr]Zr-DFO-YS5 PET/CT specifically detected multiple myeloma lesions in a variety of models, with low uptake in controls, including CD46 knockout (KO) mice or multiple myeloma mice using a nontargeted antibody. In the MM.1S systemic model, localization of uptake on PET imaging correlated well with the luciferase expression from tumor cells. A treatment study using [225Ac]Ac-DOTA-YS5 in the MM.1S systemic model demonstrated a clear tumor volume and survival benefit in the treated groups. Our study showed that the CD46-targeted probe [89Zr]Zr-DFO-YS5 can successfully image CD46-expressing multiple myeloma xenografts in murine models, and [225Ac]Ac-DOTA-YS5 can effectively inhibit the growth of multiple myeloma. These results demonstrate that CD46 is a promising theranostic target for multiple myeloma, with the potential for clinical translation.",2415

To assess differences in ADC and inter-rater variability, ADC values of 359 lymph nodes in 101 patients undergoing simultaneous prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-PET/MRI were retrospectively measured by two blinded readers and compared in a node-by-node analysis with respect to lymph node status. In addition, a phantom and 13 patients with 86 lymph nodes were prospectively measured on two different MRI scanners to analyze inter-scanner agreement. To estimate the diagnostic quality of the ADC in real-world application, a computer simulation was used to emulate the blurring caused by scanner and reader variability. To account for intra-individual correlation, the statistical analyses and simulations were based on linear mixed models. The mean ADC of lymph nodes showing PSMA signals in PET was markedly lower (0.77 × 10 Our model-based simulation approach implicates a high potential of ADC for lymph node classification in prostate cancer, even when inter-rater and inter-scanner variability are considered. The ADC value shows a high diagnostic potential for lymph node classification in prostate cancer. The robustness to scanner and reader variability implicates that this easy to measure and widely available method could be readily integrated into clinical routine. • The diagnostic value of the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) for lymph node classification in prostate cancer is unclear in the light of inter-rater and inter-scanner variability. • Metastatic and inconspicuous lymph nodes differ significantly in ADC, resulting in a high diagnostic potential that is robust to inter-scanner and inter-rater variability. • ADC has a high potential for lymph node classification in prostate cancer that is maintained under conditions comparable to clinical practice.",2058
38099964,Smart forecasting of artifacts in contrast-enhanced breast MRI before contrast agent administration.,European radiology,2024,"To evaluate whether artifacts on contrast-enhanced (CE) breast MRI maximum intensity projections (MIPs) might already be forecast before gadolinium-based contrast agent (GBCA) administration during an ongoing examination by analyzing the unenhanced T1-weighted images acquired before the GBCA injection. This IRB-approved retrospective analysis consisted of n = 2884 breast CE MRI examinations after intravenous administration of GBCA, acquired with n = 4 different MRI devices at different field strengths (1.5 T/3 T) during clinical routine. CE-derived subtraction MIPs were used to conduct a multi-class multi-reader evaluation of the presence and severity of artifacts with three independent readers. An ensemble classifier (EC) of five DenseNet models was used to predict artifacts for the post-contrast subtraction MIPs, giving as the input source only the pre-contrast T1-weighted sequence. Thus, the acquisition directly preceded the GBCA injection. The area under ROC (AuROC) and diagnostics accuracy scores were used to assess the performance of the neural network in an independent holdout test set (n = 285). After majority voting, potentially significant artifacts were detected in 53.6% (n = 1521) of all breast MRI examinations (age 49.6 ± 12.6 years). In the holdout test set (mean age 49.7 ± 11.8 years), at a specificity level of 89%, the EC could forecast around one-third of artifacts (sensitivity 31%) before GBCA administration, with an AuROC = 0.66. This study demonstrates the capability of a neural network to forecast the occurrence of artifacts on CE subtraction data before the GBCA administration. If confirmed in larger studies, this might enable a workflow-blended approach to prevent breast MRI artifacts by implementing in-scan personalized predictive algorithms. Some artifacts in contrast-enhanced breast MRI maximum intensity projections might be predictable before gadolinium-based contrast agent injection using a neural network. • Potentially significant artifacts can be observed in a relevant proportion of breast MRI subtraction sequences after gadolinium-based contrast agent administration (GBCA). • Forecasting the occurrence of such artifacts in subtraction maximum intensity projections before GBCA administration for individual patients was feasible at 89% specificity, which allowed correctly predicting one in three future artifacts. • Further research is necessary to investigate the clinical value of such smart personalized imaging approaches.",2496

A systematic search in Medline was conducted for studies describing the symptomatology of myasthenia gravis patients before and after receiving intravenous (IV) CM and having a matched control group of myasthenia gravis patients who did not receive IV CM. Three retrospective studies were selected with a total of 374 myasthenia gravis patients who received iodine-based CM and a total of 313 myasthenia gravis patients who underwent unenhanced CT and served as controls. Pooling of the data from the three retrospective studies showed that in 23 of 374 patients, increased symptoms after iodine-based CM administration were described (6.1%). Increased symptomatology also occurred in 11 of 313 patients after unenhanced CT (3.5%). When looking more deeply into the data of the three studies, conflicting results were found, as two articles did not find any relationship between CM and myasthenia gravis symptoms. The remaining study only found a significant increase in symptomatology within 1 day after CT scanning: seven patients (6.3%) in the contrast-enhanced CT group and one patient (0.6%) in the unenhanced CT group (p = 0.01). There is limited evidence on the relationship between CM and myasthenia gravis symptoms. In the vast majority of myasthenia gravis patients, CM are safe. Probably, in less than 5% of the patients, iodine-based CM administration may lead to increased severity of the symptoms within the first 24 h after administration. Be aware that intravenous administration of iodine-based contrast media can lead to an increase of symptoms in patients with myasthenia gravis within the first 24 h. This can probably happen in less than 5% of the patients. • It is unclear whether modern contrast media can lead to increased symptoms in myasthenia gravis patients after intravenous administration. • There seems to be a small risk of increased myasthenia gravis symptoms within 24 h after intravenous administration of iodine-based contrast media, probably in less than 5% of the administrations. • Gadolinium-based contrast media are safe for patients with myasthenia gravis.",2264

American journal of roentgenology,2024,"Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is a nonobligate precursor to invasive cancer that classically presents as asymptomatic calcifications on screening mammography. The increase in DCIS diagnoses with organized screening programs has raised concerns about overdiagnosis, while a patientcentric push for more personalized care has increased awareness about DCIS overtreatment. The standard of care for most new DCIS diagnoses is surgical excision, but nonsurgical management via active monitoring is gaining attention, and multiple clinical trials are ongoing. Imaging, along with demographic and pathologic information, is a critical component of active monitoring efforts. Commonly used imaging modalities including mammography, ultrasound, and MRI, as well as newer modalities such as contrast-enhanced mammography and dedicated breast PET, can provide prognostic information to risk stratify patients for DCIS active monitoring eligibility. Furthermore, radiologists will be responsible for closely surveilling patients on active monitoring and identifying if invasive progression occurs. Active monitoring is a paradigm shift for DCIS care, but the success or failure will rely heavily on the interpretations and guidance of radiologists.",1238

Furthermore, this study aimed to incorporate measurements into a multiparametric model for radiological determination of PLONI. In this retrospective multicenter case-control study, high-spatial-resolution 3D T2-weighted MR images were used to measure the distal optic nerve. Histopathology was the reference standard for PLONI. Two neuroradiologists independently measured the optic nerve width, height, and surface at 0, 3, and 5 mm from the most distal part of the optic nerve. Subsequently, PLONI was scored on contrast-enhanced T1-weighted and 3D T2-weighted images, blinded for clinical data. Optic nerve measurements with the highest diagnostic accuracy for PLONI were incorporated into a prediction model for radiological determination of PLONI. One hundred twenty-four retinoblastoma patients (median age, 22 months [range, 0-113], 58 female) were included, resulting in 25 retinoblastoma eyes with histopathologically proven PLONI and 206 without PLONI. ROC analysis of axial optic nerve width measured at 0 mm yielded the best area under the curve of 0.88 (95% confidence interval: 0.79, 0.96; p < 0.001). The optimal width cutoff was ≥ 2.215 mm, with a sensitivity of 84% (95% CI: 64, 95%) and specificity of 83% (95% CI: 75, 89%) for detecting PLONI. Combining width measurements with the suspicion of PLONI on MRI sequences resulted in a prediction model with an improved sensitivity and specificity of respectively up to 88% and 92%. Postlaminar optic nerve thickening can predict early-stage postlaminar optic nerve invasion in retinoblastoma. This study provides an additional tool for clinicians to help determine postlaminar optic nerve invasion, which is a risk factor for developing metastatic disease in retinoblastoma patients. • The diagnostic accuracy of contrast-enhanced MRI for detecting postlaminar optic nerve invasion is limited in retinoblastoma patients. • Optic nerve thickening can predict postlaminar optic nerve invasion. • A prediction model combining MRI features has a high sensitivity and specificity for detecting postlaminar optic nerve invasion.",2233
38081200,"MRI in addition to CT in patients scheduled for local therapy of colorectal liver metastases (CAMINO): an international, multicentre, prospective, diagnostic accuracy trial.",The Lancet. Oncology,2024,"Guidelines are inconclusive on whether contrast-enhanced MRI using gadoxetic acid and diffusion-weighted imaging should be added routinely to CT in the investigation of patients with colorectal liver metastases who are scheduled for curative liver resection or thermal ablation, or both. Although contrast-enhanced MRI is reportedly superior than contrast-enhanced CT in the detection and characterisation of colorectal liver metastases, its effect on clinical patient management is unknown. We aimed to assess the clinical effect of an additional liver contrast-enhanced MRI on local treatment plan in patients with colorectal liver metastases amenable to local treatment, based on contrast-enhanced CT. We did an international, multicentre, prospective, incremental diagnostic accuracy trial in 14 liver surgery centres in the Netherlands, Belgium, Norway, and Italy. Participants were aged 18 years or older with histological proof of colorectal cancer, a WHO performance status score of 0-4, and primary or recurrent colorectal liver metastases, who were scheduled for local therapy based on contrast-enhanced CT. All patients had contrast-enhanced CT and liver contrast-enhanced MRI including diffusion-weighted imaging and gadoxetic acid as a contrast agent before undergoing local therapy. The primary outcome was change in the local clinical treatment plan (decided by the individual clinics) on the basis of liver contrast-enhanced MRI findings, analysed in the intention-to-image population. The minimal clinically important difference in the proportion of patients who would have change in their local treatment plan due to an additional liver contrast-enhanced MRI was 10%. This study is closed and registered in the Netherlands Trial Register, NL8039. Between Dec 17, 2019, and July 31, 2021, 325 patients with colorectal liver metastases were assessed for eligibility. 298 patients were enrolled and included in the intention-to-treat population, including 177 males (59%) and 121 females (41%) with planned local therapy based on contrast-enhanced CT. A change in the local treatment plan based on liver contrast-enhanced MRI findings was observed in 92 (31%; 95% CI 26-36) of 298 patients. Changes were made for 40 patients (13%) requiring more extensive local therapy, 11 patients (4%) requiring less extensive local therapy, and 34 patients (11%) in whom the indication for curative-intent local therapy was revoked, including 26 patients (9%) with too extensive disease and eight patients (3%) with benign lesions on liver contrast-enhanced MRI (confirmed by a median follow-up of 21·0 months [IQR 17·5-24·0]).

To this end, standardization of imaging algorithms, technical requirements, and reporting is therefore a prerequisite. Since the first European Society of Musculoskeletal Radiology (ESSR) consensus in 2015, technical achievements, further insights into specific entities, and the revised WHO-classification (2020) and AJCC staging system (2017) made an update necessary. The guidelines are intended to support radiologists in their decision-making and contribute to interdisciplinary tumor board discussions. A validated Delphi method based on peer-reviewed literature was used to derive consensus among a panel of 46 specialized musculoskeletal radiologists from 12 European countries. Statements were scored online by level of agreement (0 to 10) during two iterative rounds. Either ""group consensus,"" ""group agreement,"" or ""lack of agreement"" was achieved. Eight sections were defined that finally contained 145 statements with comments. Overall, group consensus was reached in 95.9%, and group agreement in 4.1%. This communication contains the first part consisting of the imaging algorithm for suspected soft tissue tumors, methods for local imaging, and the role of tumor centers. Ultrasound represents the initial triage imaging modality for accessible and small tumors. MRI is the modality of choice for the characterization and local staging of most soft tissue tumors. CT is indicated in special situations. In suspicious or likely malignant tumors, a specialist tumor center should be contacted for referral or teleradiologic second opinion. This should be done before performing a biopsy, without exception. The updated ESSR soft tissue tumor imaging guidelines aim to provide best practice expert consensus for standardized imaging, to support radiologists in their decision-making, and to improve examination comparability both in individual patients and in future studies on individualized strategies. • Ultrasound remains the best initial triage imaging modality for accessible and small suspected soft tissue tumors. • MRI is the modality of choice for the characterization and local staging of soft tissue tumors in most cases; CT is indicated in special situations.

38060003,"Willingness to participate in combination screening for lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and cardiovascular disease in four European countries.",European radiology,2024,"Lung cancer screening (LCS), using low-dose computed tomography (LDCT), can be more efficient by simultaneously screening for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and cardiovascular disease (CVD), the Big-3 diseases. This study aimed to determine the willingness to participate in (combinations of) Big-3 screening in four European countries and the relative importance of amendable participation barriers. An online cross-sectional survey aimed at (former) smokers aged 50-75 years elicited the willingness of individuals to participate in Big-3 screening and used analytical hierarchy processing (AHP) to determine the importance of participation barriers. Respondents were from France (n = 391), Germany (n = 338), Italy (n = 399), and the Netherlands (n = 342), and consisted of 51.2% men. The willingness to participate in screening was marginally influenced by the diseases screened for (maximum difference of 3.1%, for Big-3 screening (73.4%) vs. lung cancer and COPD screening (70.3%)) and by country (maximum difference of 3.7%, between France (68.5%) and the Netherlands (72.3%)). The largest effect on willingness to participate was personal perceived risk of lung cancer. The most important barriers were the missed cases during screening (weight 0.19) and frequency of screening (weight 0.14), while diseases screened for (weight 0.11) ranked low. The difference in willingness to participate in LCS showed marginal increase with inclusion of more diseases and limited variation between countries. A marginal increase in participation might result in a marginal additional benefit of Big-3 screening. The amendable participation barriers are similar to previous studies, and the new criterion, diseases screened for, is relatively unimportant. Adding diseases to combination screening modestly improves participation, driven by personal perceived risk. These findings guide program design and campaigns for lung cancer and Big-3 screening. Benefits of Big-3 screening lie in long-term health and economic impact, not participation increase. • It is unknown whether or how combination screening might affect participation. • The addition of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and cardiovascular disease to lung cancer screening resulted in a marginal increase in willingness to participate. • The primary determinant influencing individuals' engagement in such programs is their personal perceived risk of the disease.",2441

American journal of roentgenology,2024,"Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy is a cellular therapy in which the patient's T cells are enhanced to recognize and bind to specific tumor antigens. CAR T-cell therapy was initially developed for the treatment of leukemia, but its current main indication is the treatment of relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin lymphoma. FDG PET/CT plays a fundamental role in the diagnosis, staging, therapy response assessment, and recurrence evaluation of patients with metabolically active lymphoma. Consistent with the examination's role in lymphoma management, FDG PET/CT is also the imaging modality of choice to evaluate patients before and after CAR T-cell therapy, and evidence supporting its utility in this setting continues to accumulate. In this article, we review current concepts in CAR T-cell therapy in patients with lymphoma, emphasizing the critical role of FDG PET/CT before and after therapy. A framework is presented that entails performing FDG PET/CT at four time points over the course of CAR T-cell therapy: pretherapy at baseline at the time of decision to administer CAR T-cell therapy and after any bridging therapies and posttherapy 1 and 3 months after infusion. PET parameters assessed at these time points predict various patient outcomes.",1268

However, it is not known how the prognostic characteristics of the cancers detected with the two screening approaches differ. Purpose To compare invasive breast cancers detected with DBT plus SM (test arm) versus DM (control arm) screening with regard to tumor stage, histologic grade, patient age, and breast density. Materials and Methods This exploratory subanalysis of the Tomosynthesis plus Synthesized Mammography (TOSYMA) study, which is a multicenter randomized controlled trial embedded in the German mammography screening program, recruited women aged 50-70 years from July 2018 to December 2020. It compared invasive cancer detection rates (iCDRs), rate differences, and odds ratios (ORs) between the arms stratified by Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) stage (I vs II-IV), histologic grade (1 vs 2 or 3), age group (50-59 vs 60-70 years), and Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System categories of breast density (A or B vs C or D). Results In total, 49 462 (median age, 57 years [IQR, 53-62 years]) and 49 669 (median age, 57 years [IQR, 53-62 years]) participants were allocated to DBT plus SM and DM screening, respectively. The iCDR of stage I tumors with DBT plus SM was 51.6 per 10 000 women (255 of 49 462) and with DM it was 30.0 per 10 000 women (149 of 49 669). DBT plus SM depicted more stage I tumors with grade 2 or 3 (166 of 49 462, 33.7 per 10 000 women) than DM (106 of 49 669, 21.3 per 10 000 women; rate difference, +12.3 per 10 000 women [95% CI: 0.3, 24.9]; OR, 1.6 [95% CI: 0.9, 2.7]). DBT plus SM achieved the highest iCDR of stage I tumors with grade 2 or 3 among women aged 60-70 years with dense breasts (41 of 7364, 55.4 per 10 000 women; rate difference, +21.6 per 10 000 women [95% CI: -21.1, 64.3]; OR, 1.6 [95% CI: 0.6, 4.5]).

Somatostatin receptor type 2 (SSTR2) represents a promising treatment target in meningiomas. In this multicenter, single-arm phase II clinical study (NCT03971461), the SSTR2-targeting radiopharmaceutical 177Lu-DOTATATE is evaluated for its feasibility, safety, and therapeutic efficacy in these patients. Adult patients with progressive intracranial meningiomas received 177Lu-DOTATATE at a dose of 7.4 GBq (200 mCi) every eight weeks for four cycles. 68Ga-DOTATATE PET-MRI was performed before and six months after the start of the treatment. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) at 6 months (PFS-6). Secondary endpoints were safety and tolerability, overall survival (OS) at 12 months (OS-12), median PFS, and median OS. Fourteen patients (female = 11, male = 3) with progressive meningiomas (WHO 1 = 3, 2 = 10, 3 = 1) were enrolled. Median age was 63.1 (range 49.7-78) years. All patients previously underwent tumor resection and at least one course of radiation. Treatment with 177Lu-DOTATATE was well tolerated. Seven patients (50%) achieved PFS-6. Best radiographic response by modified Macdonald criteria was stable disease (SD) in all seven patients. A >25% reduction in 68Ga-DOTATATE uptake (PET) was observed in five meningiomas and two patients. In one lesion, this corresponded to >50% reduction in bidirectional tumor measurements (MRI). Treatment with 177Lu-DOTATATE was well tolerated.

A total of 238 patients with 496 LM were treated with RFA either with CT (CT group) or magnetic resonance (MR group) guidance. Every ablated LM was assessed and followed up with diagnostic MRI. Technical success, technique efficacy, predictive factors, recurrence rates, and overall survival were assessed. The CT group comprised 143 patients and the MR group 77 patients. Eighteen patients underwent ablation with both modalities. Technical success per patient and per lesion was 88% and 93% for CT and 87% and 89.6% for MR, and technique efficacy was 97.1% and 98.6% for CT and 98.7% and 99.3% for MR respectively. Local recurrence following the first ablation (primary patency) occurred in 20.1% (CT) vs 4.6% (MR) (p < 0.001). Residual liver tumor, size of LM, and advanced N and M stage at initial diagnosis were independent predictors for overall survival in both groups. The median overall survival measured from first RFA treatment was 2.6 years. The 1-year, 5-year, and 10-year survival were 85.9%, 25.5%, and 19.1% respectively. The MR group had significantly better local control compared to the CT group. There was no significant difference in patient survival between the two groups. MR-guided radiofrequency ablation of colorectal liver metastases is safe and effective, and offers better local control than CT-guided ablation. • Imaging modality for radiofrequency ablation guidance is an independent predictor of local recurrence in colorectal liver metastases. • MR-guided radiofrequency ablation achieved better local control of liver metastases from colorectal cancer than CT-guided. • The number and size of liver metastases are, among others, independent predictors of survival.

In this retrospective longitudinal analysis of prospective cohorts, six breast radiographers with varying experience in the field were asked to use automated software to improve their performance in breast compression and positioning. The software tool automatically analyzes craniocaudal (CC) and mediolateral oblique (MLO) views for their positioning quality by scoring them according to PGMI classifications (perfect, good, moderate, inadequate) and checking whether the compression pressure is within the target range. The positioning and compression data from the studies acquired before the start of the project were used as individual baselines, while the data obtained after the training were used to test whether conscious use of the software could help the radiographers improve their performance. The percentage of views rated perfect or good and the percentage of views in target compression were used as overall metrics to assess changes in performance. Following the use of the software, all radiographers significantly increased the percentage of images rated as perfect or good in both CCs and MLOs. Individual improvements ranged from 7 to 14% for CC and 10 to 16% for MLO views. Moreover, most radiographers exhibited improved compression performance in CCs, with improvements up to 16%. Active use of a software tool to automatically assess the correctness of breast compression and positioning in breast cancer screening can improve the performance of radiographers. This study suggests that the use of a software tool for automatically evaluating correctness of breast compression and positioning in breast cancer screening can improve the performance of radiographers on these metrics, which may ultimately lead to improved screening outcomes. • Proper breast positioning and compression are critical in breast cancer screening to ensure accurate diagnosis. • Active use of the software increased the quality of craniocaudal and mediolateral oblique views acquired by all radiographers. • Improved performance of radiographers is expected to improve screening outcomes.",2267
38012454,Sonic hedgehog hepatocellular adenoma: magnetic resonance imaging features and correlation with histology.,European radiology,2024,"Sonic hedgehog hepatocellular adenoma (shHCA) is a new hepatocellular adenoma (HCA) subgroup characterized by high risk of hemorrhage. ShHCA account for below 10% of all HCA cases and are often associated with female gender, obesity, and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. No specific MRI characteristics have been described to date. The objective of this study was to assess the value of using MRI to identify shHCA, and correlate MRI findings with histology. We retrospectively collected MRI scans of 29 patients with shHCA from our center and from different liver referral centers to include 35 lesions. Diagnosis of shHCA was assessed by immunohistochemical overexpression of argininosuccinate synthase 1 or prostaglandin D2 synthase, then confirmed by molecular analysis of sonic hedgehog pathway activation and/or by proteomic analysis. In 46% (n = 16/35) of shHCA cases, we detected intralesional fluid-filled cavities defined on MR images as fluid-like foci markedly hyperintense on T2-weighted sequences, and hypointense on T1-weighted sequences, with or without delayed enhancement. Pathologically, these cavities were observed in 54% of cases as vacuoles filled with blood at different stages of degradation. Hemorrhage and/or necrosis were detected among 71% of cases by MRI analysis (n = 25/35) versus 82% pathologically. Seventeen percent of shHCA cases (n = 6/35) were completely homogeneous via MRI and pathological analysis. No MRI criteria was found in favor of focal nodular hyperplasia, HNF1A-mutated HCA, or typical inflammatory HCA. We reveal the presence of intralesional fluid-filled cavities among 46% of our shHCA cases that represent a new MRI finding possibly helpful for shHCA diagnosis. This multicenter study is the first clinical study about the radiological aspect of this new hepatocellular adenoma subgroup. This highlights a strong correlation between MRI and histological analysis, with a specific pattern emerging for diagnosis. • Sonic hedgehog hepatocellular adenoma is a new hepatocellular adenoma subgroup associated with high risk of hemorrhage, but imaging features of this subgroup remain unknown. • Analysis of MR images and correlation with pathology revealed intralesional fluid-filled cavities and necrotic-hemorrhagic changes. • Intralesional fluid-filled cavities have not yet been described in other adenoma subtypes and represent a new MRI finding for sonic hedgehog hepatocellular adenoma.",2439
38008743,Image quality of DWI at breast MRI depends on the amount of fibroglandular tissue: implications for unenhanced screening.,European radiology,2024,"To compare image quality of diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and contrast-enhanced breast MRI (DCE-T1) stratified by the amount of fibroglandular tissue (FGT) as a measure of breast density. Retrospective, multi-reader, bicentric visual grading analysis study on breast density (A-D) and overall image and fat suppression quality of DWI and DCE-T1, scored on a standard 5-point Likert scale. Cross tabulations and visual grading characteristic (VGC) curves were calculated for fatty breasts (A/B) versus dense breasts (C/D). Image quality of DWI was higher in the case of increased breast density, with good scores (score 3-5) in 85.9% (D) and 88.4% (C), compared to 61.6% (B) and 53.5% (A). Overall image quality of DWI was in favor of dense breasts (C/D), with an area under the VGC curve of 0.659 (p < 0.001). Quality of DWI and DCE-T1 fat suppression increased with higher breast density, with good scores (score 3-5) for 86.9% and 45.7% of density D, and 90.2% and 42.9% of density C cases, compared to 76.0% and 33.6% for density B and 54.7% and 29.6% for density A (DWI and DCE-T1 respectively). Dense breasts show excellent fat suppression and substantially higher image quality in DWI images compared with non-dense breasts. These results support the setup of studies exploring DWI-based MR imaging without IV contrast for additional screening of women with dense breasts. Our findings demonstrate that image quality of DWI is robust in women with an increased amount of fibroglandular tissue, technically supporting the feasibility of exploring applications such as screening of women with mammographically dense breasts. • Image and fat suppression quality of diffusion-weighted imaging are dependent on the amount of fibroglandular tissue (FGT) which is closely connected to breast density. • Fat suppression quality in diffusion-weighted imaging of the breast is best in women with a high amount of fibroglandular tissue. • High image quality of diffusion-weighted imaging in women with a high amount of FGT in MRI supports that the technical feasibility of DWI can be explored in the additional screening of women with mammographically dense breasts.",2164
37999727,Preoperative breast MRI positively impacts surgical outcomes of needle biopsy-diagnosed pure DCIS: a patient-matched analysis from the MIPA study.,European radiology,2024,"To investigate the influence of preoperative breast MRI on mastectomy and reoperation rates in patients with pure ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). The MIPA observational study database (7245 patients) was searched for patients aged 18-80 years with pure unilateral DCIS diagnosed at core needle or vacuum-assisted biopsy (CNB/VAB) and planned for primary surgery. Patients who underwent preoperative MRI (MRI group) were matched (1:1) to those who did not receive MRI (noMRI group) according to 8 confounding covariates that drive referral to MRI (age; hormonal status; familial risk; posterior-to-nipple diameter; BI-RADS category; lesion diameter; lesion presentation; surgical planning at conventional imaging). Surgical outcomes were compared between the matched groups with nonparametric statistics after calculating odds ratios (ORs). Of 1005 women with pure unilateral DCIS at CNB/VAB (507 MRI group, 498 noMRI group), 309 remained in each group after matching. First-line mastectomy rate in the MRI group was 20.1% (62/309 patients, OR 2.03) compared to 11.0% in the noMRI group (34/309 patients, p = 0.003). The reoperation rate was 10.0% in the MRI group (31/309, OR for reoperation 0.40) and 22.0% in the noMRI group (68/309, p < 0.001), with a 2.53 OR of avoiding reoperation in the MRI group. The overall mastectomy rate was 23.3% in the MRI group (72/309, OR 1.40) and 17.8% in the noMRI group (55/309, p = 0.111). Compared to those going directly to surgery, patients with pure DCIS at CNB/VAB who underwent preoperative MRI had a higher OR for first-line mastectomy but a substantially lower OR for reoperation. When confounding factors behind MRI referral are accounted for in the comparison of patients with CNB/VAB-diagnosed pure unilateral DCIS, preoperative MRI yields a reduction of reoperations that is more than twice as high as the increase in overall mastectomies. • Confounding factors cause imbalance when investigating the influence of preoperative MRI on surgical outcomes of pure DCIS. • When patient matching is applied to women with pure unilateral DCIS, reoperation rates are significantly reduced in women who underwent preoperative MRI. • The reduction of reoperations brought about by preoperative MRI is more than double the increase in overall mastectomies.",2296
37994967,Pretreatment MRI-detected extramural venous invasion as a prognostic and predictive biomarker for neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy in non-metastatic rectal cancer: a propensity score matched analysis.,European radiology,2024,"This study evaluated pretreatment magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-detected extramural venous invasion (pmrEMVI) as a predictor of survival after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT) in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC). Medical records of 1184 patients with rectal adenocarcinoma who underwent TME between January 2011 and December 2016 were reviewed. MRI data were collected from a computerized radiologic database. Cox proportional hazards analysis was used to assess local, systemic recurrence, and disease-free survival risk based on pretreatment MRI-assessed tumor characteristics. After propensity score matching (PSM) for pretreatment MRI features, nCRT therapeutic outcomes according to pmrEMVI status were evaluated. Cox proportional hazards analysis was used to identify risk factors for early recurrence in patients receiving nCRT. Median follow-up was 62.8 months. Among all patients, the presence of pmrEMVI was significantly associated with worse disease-free survival (DFS; HR 1.827, 95% CI 1.285-2.597, p = 0.001) and systemic recurrence (HR 2.080, 95% CI 1.400-3.090, p < 0.001) but not local recurrence. Among patients with pmrEMVI, nCRT provided no benefit for oncological outcomes before or after PSM. Furthermore, pmrEMVI( +) was the only factor associated with early recurrence on multivariate analysis in patients receiving nCRT. pmrEMVI is a poor prognostic factor for DFS and SR in patients with non-metastatic rectal cancer and also serves as a predictive biomarker of poor DFS and SR following nCRT in LARC. Therefore, for patients who are positive for pmrEMVI, consideration of alternative treatment strategies may be warranted. This study demonstrated the usefulness of pmrEMVI as a predictive biomarker for nCRT, which may assist in initial treatment decision-making in patients with non-metastatic rectal cancer. • Pretreatment MRI-detected extramural venous invasion (pmrEMVI) was significantly associated with worse disease-free survival and systemic recurrence in patients with non-metastatic rectal cancer. • pmrEMVI is a predictive biomarker of poor DFS following nCRT in patients with LARC. • The presence of pmrEMVI was the only factor associated with early recurrence on multivariate analysis in patients receiving nCRT.",2278
37994966,Automatic image segmentation and online survival prediction model of medulloblastoma based on machine learning.,European radiology,2024,"To develop a dynamic nomogram containing radiomics signature and clinical features for estimating the overall survival (OS) of patients with medulloblastoma (MB) and design an automatic image segmentation model to reduce labor and time costs. Data from 217 medulloblastoma (MB) patients over the past 4 years were collected and separated into a training set and a test set. Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), random survival forest (RSF), and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression methods were employed to select variables in the training set. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard models, as well as Kaplan-Meier analysis, were utilized to determine the relationship among the radiomics signature, clinical features, and overall survival. A dynamic nomogram was developed. Additionally, a 3D-Unet deep learning model was used to train the automatic tumor delineation model. Higher Rad-scores were significantly associated with worse OS in both the training and validation sets (p < 0.001 and p = 0.047, respectively). The Cox model combined clinical and radiomics signatures ([IBS = 0.079], [C-index = 0.747, SE = 0.045]) outperformed either radiomics signatures alone ([IBS = 0.081], [C-index = 0.738, SE = 0.041]) or clinical features alone ([IBS = 0.085], [C-index = 0.565, SE = 0.041]). The segmentation model had mean Dice coefficients of 0.80, 0.82, and 0.78 in the training, validation, and test sets respectively. A deep learning-based tumor segmentation model was built with Dice coefficients of 0.8372, 0.8017, and 0.7673 on the training set, validation set, and test set, respectively. A combination of radiomics features and clinical characteristics enhances the accuracy of OS prediction in medulloblastoma patients. Additionally, building an MRI image automatic segmentation model reduces labor and time costs. A survival prognosis model based on radiomics and clinical characteristics could improve the accuracy of prognosis estimation for medulloblastoma patients, and an MRI-based automatic tumor segmentation model could reduce the cost of time. • A model that combines radiomics and clinical features can predict the survival prognosis of patients with medulloblastoma. • Online nomogram and image automatic segmentation model can help doctors better judge the prognosis of medulloblastoma and save working time. • The developed AI system can help doctors judge the prognosis of diseases and promote the development of precision medicine.",2508
37989916,Assessment of arterial-phase hyperenhancement and late-phase washout of hepatocellular carcinoma-a meta-analysis of contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) with SonoVue® and Sonazoid®.,European radiology,2024,"The recognition of arterial phase hyperenhancement (APHE) and washout during the late phase is key for correct diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS). This meta-analysis was conducted to compare SonoVue®-enhanced and Sonazoid®-enhanced ultrasound in the assessment of HCC enhancement and diagnosis. Studies were included in the analysis if they reported data for HCC enhancement in the arterial phase and late phase for SonoVue® or in the arterial phase and Kupffer phase (KP) for Sonazoid®. Forty-two studies (7502 patients) with use of SonoVue® and 30 studies (2391 patients) with use of Sonazoid® were identified. In a pooled analysis, the comparison between SonoVue® and Sonazoid® CEUS was performed using chi-square test. An inverse variance weighted random-effect model was used to estimate proportion, sensitivity, and specificity along with 95% confidence interval (CI). In the meta-analysis, the proportion of HCC showing APHE with SonoVue®, 93% (95% CI 91-95%), was significantly higher than the proportion of HCC showing APHE with Sonazoid®, 77% (71-83%) (p < 0.0001); similarly, the proportion of HCC showing washout at late phase/KP was significantly higher with SonoVue®, 86% (83-89%), than with Sonazoid®, 76% (70-82%) (p < 0.0001). The sensitivity and specificity for the detection of APHE plus late-phase/KP washout detection in HCC were also higher with SonoVue® than with Sonazoid® (sensitivity 80% vs 52%; specificity 80% vs 73% in studies within unselected patient populations). APHE and late washout in HCC are more frequently observed with SonoVue® than with Sonazoid®. This may affect the diagnostic performance of CEUS in the diagnosis of HCCs. Meta-analysis data show the presence of key enhancement features for diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma is different between ultrasound contrast agents, and arterial hyperenhancement and late washout are more frequently observed at contrast-enhanced ultrasound with SonoVue® than with Sonazoid®. • Dynamic enhancement features are key for imaging-based diagnosis of HCC. • Arterial hyperenhancement and late washout are more often observed in HCCs using SonoVue®-enhanced US than with Sonazoid®. • The existing evidence for contrast-enhanced US may need to be considered being specific to the individual contrast agent.",2338
37987835,Independent validation of CT radiomics models in colorectal liver metastases: predicting local tumour progression after ablation.,European radiology,2024,"Independent internal and external validation of three previously published CT-based radiomics models to predict local tumor progression (LTP) after thermal ablation of colorectal liver metastases (CRLM). Patients with CRLM treated with thermal ablation were collected from two institutions to collect a new independent internal and external validation cohort. Ablation zones (AZ) were delineated on portal venous phase CT 2-8 weeks post-ablation. Radiomics features were extracted from the AZ and a 10 mm peri-ablational rim (PAR) of liver parenchyma around the AZ. Three previously published prediction models (clinical, radiomics, combined) were tested without retraining. LTP was defined as new tumor foci appearing next to the AZ up to 24 months post-ablation. The internal cohort included 39 patients with 68 CRLM and the external cohort 52 patients with 78 CRLM. 34/146 CRLM developed LTP after a median follow-up of 24 months (range 5-139). The median time to LTP was 8 months (range 2-22). The combined clinical-radiomics model yielded a c-statistic of 0.47 (95%CI 0.30-0.64) in the internal cohort and 0.50 (95%CI 0.38-0.62) in the external cohort, compared to 0.78 (95%CI 0.65-0.87) in the previously published original cohort. The radiomics model yielded c-statistics of 0.46 (95%CI 0.29-0.63) and 0.39 (95%CI 0.28-0.52), and the clinical model 0.51 (95%CI 0.34-0.68) and 0.51 (95%CI 0.39-0.63) in the internal and external cohort, respectively. The previously published results for prediction of LTP after thermal ablation of CRLM using clinical and radiomics models were not reproducible in independent internal and external validation. Local tumour progression after thermal ablation of CRLM cannot yet be predicted with the use of CT radiomics of the ablation zone and peri-ablational rim. These results underline the importance of validation of radiomics results to test for reproducibility in independent cohorts. • Previous research suggests CT radiomics models have the potential to predict local tumour progression after thermal ablation in colorectal liver metastases, but independent validation is lacking. • In internal and external validation, the previously published models were not able to predict local tumour progression after ablation. • Radiomics prediction models should be investigated in independent validation cohorts to check for reproducibility.",2382
37987665,Mammography Breast Cancer Screening Triage Using Deep Learning: A UK Retrospective Study.,Radiology,2023,"Background Breast screening enables early detection of cancers; however, most women have normal mammograms, resulting in repetitive and resource-intensive reading tasks. Purpose To investigate if deep learning (DL) algorithms can be used to triage mammograms by identifying normal results to reduce workload or flag cancers that may be overlooked. Materials and Methods In this retrospective study, three commercial DL algorithms were investigated using consecutive mammograms from two UK Breast Screening Program sites from January 2015 to December 2017 and January 2017 to December 2018 on devices from two mammography vendors. Normal mammograms with a 3-year follow-up and histopathologically proven cancer detected at screening, the subsequent round, or in the 3-year interval were included. Two algorithm thresholds were set: in scenario A, 99.0% sensitivity for rule-out triage to a lone reader, and in scenario B, approximately 1.0% additional recall providing a rule-in triage for further assessment. Both thresholds were then applied to the screening workflow in scenario C. The sensitivity and specificity were used to assess the overall predictive performance of each DL algorithm. Results The data set comprised 78 849 patients (median age, 59 years [IQR, 53-63 years]) and 887 screening-detected, 439 interval, and 688 subsequent screening round-detected cancers. In scenario A (rule-out triage), models DL-1, DL-2, and DL-3 triaged 35.0% (27 565 of 78 849), 53.2% (41 937 of 78 849), and 55.6% (43 869 of 78 849) of mammograms, respectively, with 0.0% (0 of 887) to 0.1% (one of 887) of screening-detected cancers undetected. In scenario B, DL algorithms triaged in 4.6% (20 of 439) to 8.2% (36 of 439) of interval and 5.2% (36 of 688) to 6.1% (42 of 688) of subsequent-round cancers when applied after the routine double-reading workflow. Combining both approaches in scenario C resulted in an overall noninferior specificity (difference, -0.9%; ",1961
37987657,Multiparametric MRI-based 5-year Risk Prediction Model for Biochemical Recurrence of Prostate Cancer after Radical Prostatectomy.,Radiology,2023,"Background Current predictive tools to estimate the risk of biochemical recurrence (BCR) after treatment of prostate cancer do not consider multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) information. Purpose To develop a risk prediction tool that considers mpMRI findings to assess the risk of 5-year BCR after radical prostatectomy. Materials and Methods In this retrospective single-center analysis in 1459 patients with prostate cancer who underwent mpMRI before radical prostatectomy (in 2012-2015), the outcome of interest was 5-year BCR (two consecutive prostate-specific antigen [PSA] levels > 0.2 ng/mL [0.2 µg/L]). Patients were randomly divided into training (70%) and test (30%) sets. Kaplan-Meier plots were applied to the training set to estimate survival probabilities. Multivariable Cox regression models were used to test the relationship between BCR and different sets of exploratory variables. The C-index of the final model was calculated for the training and test sets and was compared with European Association of Urology, University of California San Francisco Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, and Partin risk tools using the partial likelihood ratio test. Five risk categories were created. Results The median duration of follow-up in the whole cohort was 59 months (IQR, 32-81 months); 376 of 1459 (25.8%) patients had BCR. A multivariable Cox regression model (referred to as PIPEN, and composed of PSA density, International Society of Urological Pathology grade group, Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System category, European Society of Urogenital Radiology extraprostatic extension score, nodes) fitted to the training data yielded a C-index of 0.74, superior to that of other predictive tools (C-index 0.70 for all models; ",1785

This study aimed to investigate the long-term effects of platinum-based chemotherapy on cardiac function and myocardial tissue in GCC survivors by cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging. Asymptomatic GCC survivors ≥ 3 years after platinum-based chemotherapy and age-matched healthy controls underwent CMR assessment, including left ventricular (LV) and right ventricular (RV) ejection fraction (EF), strain analysis, late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) imaging, and T1/T2 mapping. Forty-four survivors (age 44 [interquartile range, IQR 37-52] years; follow-up time 10 [IQR 5-15] years after chemotherapy) and 21 controls were evaluated. LV- and RVEF were lower in GCC survivors compared to controls (LVEF 56 ± 5% vs. 59 ± 5%, p = 0.017; RVEF 50 ± 7% vs. 55 ± 7%, p = 0.008). Seven percent (3/44) of survivors showed reduced LVEF (< 50%), and 41% (18/44) showed borderline LVEF (50-54%). The strain analysis revealed significantly reduced deformation compared to controls (LV global longitudinal strain [GLS] -13 ± 2% vs. -15 ± 1%, p < 0.001; RV GLS -15 ± 4% vs. -19 ± 4%, p = 0.005). Tissue characterization revealed focal myocardial fibrosis in 9 survivors (20%) and lower myocardial native T1 times in survivors compared to controls (1202 ± 25 ms vs. 1226 ± 37 ms, p = 0.016). Attenuated LVEF was observed after two cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy (54 ± 5% vs. 62 ± 5%, p < 0.001). Based on CMR evaluation, combination chemotherapy with cumulative cisplatin ≥ 200 mg/m Platinum-based chemotherapy is associated with decreased systolic function, non-ischemic focal myocardial scar, and decreased T1 times in asymptomatic long-term germ cell cancer survivors. Clinicians should be particularly aware of the risk of cardiac toxicity after platinum-based chemotherapy. • Platinum-based chemotherapy is associated with attenuation of biventricular systolic function, lower myocardial T1 relaxation times, and non-ischemic late gadolinium enhancement. • Decreased systolic function and non-ischemic late gadolinium enhancement are associated with a cumulative cisplatin dose of  ≥ 200 mg/m",2258

This study included patients with LACC showing parametrial invasion at Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). They were treated with neoadjuvant chemo-radiotherapy (CT/RT) before undergoing radical hysterectomy. The staging MRIs were reviewed retrospectively. Measurements of maximum PMI (PMI Out of 221 patients, 126 (57%) had non-metastatic lymph nodes (N-), while 95 (43%) had metastatic lymph nodes (N+). The median observation period for all these patients was 73 months (95% confidence interval [CI]: 66-77). The 5-year DFS and CSS probability rates were 75% and 85.7%, respectively, for the N- group and 54.3% and 73.6%, respectively, for the N+ group. A higher PMI The degree of PMI evaluated on MRI affects outcome in N- patients with LACC. The degree of MRI parametrial invasion affects disease-free survival and cancer-specific survival in patients with the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage IIB cervical cancer. This MRI finding can be easily incorporated into routine clinical practice. • Visual assessment of parametrial invasion on MRI was not significantly associated with prognosis in locally advanced cervical cancer (LACC). • A greater degree of parametrial invasion is associated with poorer disease-free survival and cancer-specific survival in patients with LACC without metastatic lymph node involvement. • The degree of parametrial invasion at MRI has no correlation with prognosis in LACC with metastatic lymph nodes.",1716
37981590,Head-to-head comparison of prostate-specific membrane antigen PET and multiparametric MRI in the diagnosis of pretreatment patients with prostate cancer: a meta-analysis.,European radiology,2024,"To compare prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) PET with multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) in the diagnosis of pretreatment prostate cancer (PCa). Pubmed, Embase, Medline, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library were searched for eligible studies published before June 22, 2022. We assessed risk of bias and applicability by using QUADAS-2 tool. Data synthesis was performed with Stata 17.0 software, using the ""midas"" and ""meqrlogit"" packages. We included 29 articles focusing on primary cancer detection, 18 articles about primary staging, and two articles containing them both. For PSMA PET versus mpMRI in primary PCa detection, sensitivities and specificities in the per-patient analysis were 0.90 and 0.84 (p<0.0001), and 0.66 and 0.60 (p <0.0001), and in the per-lesion analysis they were 0.79 and 0.78 (p <0.0001), and 0.84 and 0.82 (p <0.0001). For the per-patient analysis of PSMA PET versus mpMRI in primary staging, sensitivities and specificities in extracapsular extension detection were 0.59 and 0.66 (p =0.005), and 0.79 and 0.76 (p =0.0074), and in seminal vesicle infiltration (SVI) detection they were 0.51 and 0.60 (p =0.0008), and 0.93 and 0.96 (p =0.0092). For PSMA PET versus mpMRI in lymph node metastasis (LNM) detection, sensitivities and specificities in the per-patient analysis were 0.68 and 0.46 (p <0.0001), and 0.91 and 0.90 (p =0.81), and in the per-lesion analysis they were 0.67 and 0.36 (p <0.0001), and 0.99 and 0.99 (p =0.18). PSMA PET has higher diagnostic value than mpMRI in the detection of primary PCa. Regarding the primary staging, mpMRI has potential advantages in SVI detection, while PSMA PET has relative advantages in LNM detection. The integration of prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) PET into the diagnostic pathway may be helpful for improving the accuracy of prostate cancer detection. However, further studies are needed to address the cost implications and evaluate its utility in specific patient populations or clinical scenarios. Moreover, we recommend the combination of PSMA PET and mpMRI for cancer staging. • Prostate-specific membrane antigen PET has higher sensitivity and specificity for primary tumor detection in prostate cancer compared to multiparametric MRI. • Prostate-specific membrane antigen PET also has significantly better sensitivity and specificity for lymph node metastases of prostate cancer compared to multiparametric MRI. • Multiparametric MRI has better accuracy for extracapsular extension and seminal vesicle infiltration compared to ate-specific membrane antigen PET.",2560
37979009,Split scar sign to predict complete response in rectal cancer after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy: systematic review and meta-analysis.,European radiology,2024,"Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the modality of choice for rectal cancer initial staging and restaging after neoadjuvant chemoradiation. Our objective was to perform a meta-analysis of the diagnostic performance of the split scar sign (SSS) on rectal MRI in predicting complete response after neoadjuvant therapy. MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases were searched for relevant published studies through June 2023. Primary studies met eligibility criteria if they evaluated the diagnostic performance of the SSS to predict complete response on pathology or clinical follow-up in patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemoradiation. A meta-analysis with a random-effects model was used to estimate pooled sensitivity and specificity, area under the curve (AUC), and diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) of the SSS. A total of 4 studies comprising 377 patients met the inclusion criteria. The prevalence of complete response in the studies was 21.7-52.5%. The pooled sensitivity and specificity of the SSS to predict complete response were 62.0% (95% CI, 43.5-78.5%) and 91.9% (95% CI, 78.9-97.2%), respectively. The estimated AUC for SSS was 0.83 (95% CI, 0.56-0.94) with a DOR of 18.8 (95% CI, 3.65-96.5). The presence of SSS on rectal MRI demonstrated high specificity for complete response in patients with rectal cancer after neoadjuvant chemoradiation. This imaging pattern can be a valuable tool to identify potential candidates for organ-sparing treatment and surveillance. SSS presents high specificity for complete response post-neoadjuvant. This MRI finding enhances rectal cancer treatment assessment and aids clinicians and patients in choosing watch-and-wait over immediate surgery, which can potentially reduce costs and associated morbidity. •Fifteen to 50% of rectal cancer patients achieve complete response after neoadjuvant chemoradiation and may be eligible for a watch-and-wait strategy. •The split scar sign has high specificity for a complete response. •This imaging finding is valuable to select candidates for organ-sparing management.",2052
37975920,Impact of real-life use of artificial intelligence as support for human reading in a population-based breast cancer screening program with mammography and tomosynthesis.,European radiology,2024,"To evaluate the impact of using an artificial intelligence (AI) system as support for human double reading in a real-life scenario of a breast cancer screening program with digital mammography (DM) or digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT). We analyzed the performance of double reading screening with mammography and tomosynthesis after implementarion of AI as decision support. The study group consisted of a consecutive cohort of 1 year screening between March 2021 and March 2022 where double reading was performed with concurrent AI support that automatically detects and highlights lesions suspicious of breast cancer in mammography and tomosynthesis. Screening performance was measured as cancer detection rate (CDR), recall rate (RR), and positive predictive value (PPV) of recalls. Performance in the study group was compared using a McNemar test to a control group that included a screening cohort of the same size, recorded just prior to the implementation of AI. A total of 11,998 women (mean age 57.59 years ± 5.8 [sd]) were included in the study group (5049 DM and 6949 DBT). Comparing global results (including DM and DBT) of double reading with vs. without AI support, we observed an increase in CDR, PPV, and RR by 3.2/‰ (5.8 vs. 9; p < 0.001), 4% (10.6 vs. 14.6; p < 0.001), and 0.7% (5.4 vs. 6.1; p < 0.001) respectively. AI used as support for human double reading in a real-life breast cancer screening program with DM and DBT increases CDR and PPV of the recalled women. Artificial intelligence as support for human double reading improves accuracy in a real-life breast cancer screening program both in digital mammography and digital breast tomosynthesis. • AI systems based on deep learning technology offer potential for improving breast cancer screening programs. • Using artificial intelligence as support for reading improves radiologists' performance in breast cancer screening programs with mammography or tomosynthesis. • Artificial intelligence used concurrently with human reading in clinical screening practice increases breast cancer detection rate and positive predictive value of the recalled women.",2133

A total of 225 lung adenocarcinoma cases were retrospectively reviewed for demographic, clinical, pathological, traditional CT, and spectral parameters. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was carried out based on three logistic models, including a model using traditional CT features (traditional model), a model using spectral parameters (spectral model), and an integrated model combining traditional CT and spectral parameters (integrated model). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis and decision curve analysis (DCA) were performed to assess these models. Univariable analysis showed significant differences between the STAS and non-STAS groups in traditional CT features, including nodule density (p < 0.001), pleural indentation types (p = 0.006), air-bronchogram sign (p = 0.031), the presence of spiculation (p < 0.001), long-axis diameter of the entire nodule (LD) (p < 0.001), and consolidation/tumor ratio (CTR) (p < 0.001). Multivariable analysis revealed that LD > 20 mm (odds ratio [OR] = 2.271, p = 0.025) and CTR (OR = 24.208, p < 0.001) were independent predictors in the traditional model, while electronic density (ED) in the venous phase was an independent predictor in the spectral (OR = 1.062, p < 0.001) and integrated (OR = 1.055, p < 0.001) models. The area under the curve (AUC) for the integrated model (0.84) was the highest (spectral model, 0.83; traditional model, 0.80), and the difference between the integrated and traditional models was statistically significant (p = 0.015). DCA showed that the integrated model had superior clinical value versus the traditional model. DLCT has added value for STAS prediction in lung adenocarcinoma. Spectral CT has added value for spread through air spaces prediction in lung adenocarcinoma so may impact treatment planning in the future. • Electronic density may be a potential spectral index for predicting spread through air spaces in lung adenocarcinoma. • A combination of spectral and traditional CT features enhances the performance of traditional CT for predicting spread through air spaces.",2240
37968476,Intratumoral calcification: not only a diagnostic but also a prognostic indicator in oligodendrogliomas.,European radiology,2024,"Calcification is a hallmark characteristic of oligodendroglioma (ODG) that may be used as a diagnostic factor, but its prognostic implications remain unclear. This study aimed to investigate the features of calcified ODGs and to evaluate the differences in survival between patients with calcified and noncalcified ODGs. We retrospectively reviewed the records of 305 consecutive patients who were diagnosed with IDH-mutant, 1p/19q codeleted ODG at our institution from July 2009 to August 2020. Patients with intratumoral calcification were identified. The clinical, radiologic, and molecular features of the patients in the calcified group and noncalcified group were recorded. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify prognostic factors. Of the 305 patients, 112 (36.7%) were confirmed to have intratumoral calcification. Compared to ODGs without calcification, ODGs with calcifications had a larger tumor diameter; lower degree of resection; higher tumor grade; higher MGMT methylation level; higher Ki-67 index; and higher rates of midline crossing, enhancement, cyst, and 1q/19p copolysomy, and patients with calcification were more likely to receive chemoradiotherapy. ODGs with T2 hypointense calcification had a higher Hounsfield unit (HU) value on CT scans, and a lower degree of resection. Patients with T2 hypointense calcification ODGs had a shorter survival than those with non-hypointense calcification ODGs. ODGs with calcification and cysts showed a higher Ki-67 index, tumor grade, and enhanced rate, and the patients had an unfavorable overall survival (OS). Calcification was found to be a negative prognostic factor for both progression-free survival (PFS) and OS by univariate analysis, which was confirmed by the Cox proportional hazard model. Calcification is a useful negative prognostic factor for PFS and OS in patients with ODGs and could therefore be helpful in guiding personalized treatment and predicting patient prognosis. Calcification can serve as an independent prognostic factor for patients with oligodendroglioma and shows a vital role in guiding individualized treatment. • Intratumoral calcification is an independent negative prognostic risk factor for progression-free survival and overall survival in oligodendroglioma patients. • Calcifications in oligodendroglioma can be divided into hypointense and non-hypointense subtypes based on T2-weighted imaging, and patients with T2-hypointense calcification oligodendrogliomas have worse prognosis. • Calcification concurrent with cysts indicates a more aggressive phenotype of oligodendrogliomas and a significantly reduced survival rate.",2653
37968475,Evaluation of a multiparametric renal CT algorithm for diagnosis of clear-cell renal cell carcinoma among small (≤ 4 cm) solid renal masses.,European radiology,2024,"To evaluate a recently proposed CT-based algorithm for diagnosis of clear-cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) among small (≤ 4 cm) solid renal masses diagnosed by renal mass biopsy. This retrospective study included 51 small renal masses in 51 patients with renal-mass CT and biopsy between 2014 and 2021. Three radiologists independently evaluated corticomedullary phase CT for the following: heterogeneity and attenuation ratio (mass:renal cortex), which were used to inform the CT score (1-5). CT score ≥ 4 was considered positive for ccRCC. Diagnostic accuracy was calculated for each reader and overall using fixed effects logistic regression modelling. There were 51% (26/51) ccRCC and 49% (25/51) other masses. For diagnosis of ccRCC, area under curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value (PPV) were 0.69 (95% confidence interval 0.61-0.76), 78% (68-86%), 59% (46-71%), and 67% (54-79%), respectively. CT score ≤ 2 had a negative predictive value 97% (92-99%) to exclude diagnosis of ccRCC. For diagnosis of papillary renal cell carcinoma (pRCC), CT score ≤ 2, AUC, sensitivity, specificity, and PPV were 0.89 (0.81-0.98), 81% (58-94%), 98% (93-99%), and 85% (62-97%), respectively. Pooled inter-observer agreement for CT scoring was moderate (Fleiss weighted kappa = 0.52). The CT scoring system for prediction of ccRCC was sensitive with a high negative predictive value and moderate agreement. The CT score is highly specific for diagnosis of pRCC. The CT score algorithm may help guide renal mass biopsy decisions in clinical practice, with high sensitivity to identify clear-cell tumors for biopsy to establish diagnosis and grade and high specificity to avoid biopsy in papillary tumors. • A CT score ≥ 4 had high sensitivity and negative predictive value for diagnosis of clear-cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC) among solid ≤ 4-cm renal masses. • A CT score ≤ 2 was highly specific for diagnosis of papillary RCC among solid ≤ 4-cm renal masses. • Inter-observer agreement for CT score was moderate.",2035

Breast imaging providers and organizations invest significant resources in educating patients and referring physicians to address variability in changing breast cancer screening recommendations, cultural biases, and socioeconomic barriers for patients. The breast imaging examination frequently involves multiple imaging modalities, including interventional procedures, thus requiring multiple room types. Practices need to consider the variables that affect workflow efficiency throughout the process of examination scheduling, performance, interpretation, and results delivery, as well as options in facilities design for creating inviting yet functional environments for patients.

We analyzed 44 and 40 diffuse glioma samples that were pathologically confirmed as HGGs and IDH1-mutant LGGs, respectively. The DKI parameters included kurtosis metrics (mean kurtosis [MK], axial kurtosis [K Excluding FA, all DKI metrics showed significant differences between HGGs and LGGs (all p ≤ 0.001). The N/C ratio of HGGs was significantly higher than that of LGGs; however, differences in cellularity were not significant between the two glioma groups (p = 0.525).

37962503,Comparison of Contrast-enhanced Mammography with MRI Utilizing an Enriched Reader Study: A Breast Cancer Study (CONTRRAST Trial).,Radiology,2023,"Background Despite growing interest in using contrast-enhanced mammography (CEM) for breast cancer screening as an alternative to breast MRI, limited literature is available. Purpose To determine whether CEM is noninferior to breast MRI or abbreviated breast MRI (AB MRI) and superior to two-dimensional mammography in an asymptomatic population simulating those who would present for screening and then undergo diagnostic work-up. Materials and Methods This enriched reader study used CEM and MRI data prospectively collected from asymptomatic individuals at a single institution from December 2014 to March 2020. Case sets were obtained at screening, as part of work-up for a screening-detected finding, or before biopsy of a screening-detected abnormality. All images were anonymized and randomized, and all 12 radiologists interpreted them. For CEM interpretation, readers were first shown low-energy images as a surrogate for digital mammography and asked to give a forced Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System score for up to three abnormalities. The highest score was used as the case score. Readers then reviewed the full CEM examination and scored it similarly. After a minimum 1-month washout, the readers similarly interpreted AB MRI and full MRI examinations. Receiver operating characteristic analysis, powered to test CEM noninferiority to full MRI, was performed. Results The study included 132 case sets (14 negative, 74 benign, and 44 malignant; all female participants; mean age, 54 years ± 12 [SD]). The mean areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUCs) for digital mammography, CEM, AB MRI, and full MRI were 0.79, 0.91, 0.89, and 0.91, respectively. CEM was superior to digital mammography (",1733
37955670,Radiomics for the identification of extraprostatic extension with prostate MRI: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,European radiology,2024,"Extraprostatic extension (EPE) of prostate cancer (PCa) is predicted using clinical nomograms. Incorporating MRI could represent a leap forward, although poor sensitivity and standardization represent unsolved issues. MRI radiomics has been proposed for EPE prediction. The aim of the study was to systematically review the literature and perform a meta-analysis of MRI-based radiomics approaches for EPE prediction. Multiple databases were systematically searched for radiomics studies on EPE detection up to June 2022. Methodological quality was appraised according to Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2 (QUADAS-2) tool and radiomics quality score (RQS). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) was pooled to estimate predictive accuracy. A random-effects model estimated overall effect size. Statistical heterogeneity was assessed with I Thirteen studies were included, showing limitations in study design and methodological quality (median RQS 10/36), with high statistical heterogeneity. Pooled AUC for EPE identification was 0.80. In subgroup analysis, test-set and cross-validation-based studies had pooled AUC of 0.85 and 0.89 respectively. Pooled AUC was 0.72 for deep learning (DL)-based and 0.82 for handcrafted radiomics studies and 0.79 and 0.83 for studies with multiple and single scanner data, respectively. Finally, models with the best predictive performance obtained using radiomics features showed pooled AUC of 0.82, while those including clinical data of 0.76. MRI radiomics-powered models to identify EPE in PCa showed a promising predictive performance overall. However, methodologically robust, clinically driven research evaluating their diagnostic and therapeutic impact is still needed. Radiomics might improve the management of prostate cancer patients increasing the value of MRI in the assessment of extraprostatic extension. However, it is imperative that forthcoming research prioritizes confirmation studies and a stronger clinical orientation to solidify these advancements. • MRI radiomics deserves attention as a tool to overcome the limitations of MRI in prostate cancer local staging. • Pooled AUC was 0.80 for the 13 included studies, with high heterogeneity (84.7%, p < .001), methodological issues, and poor clinical orientation. • Methodologically robust radiomics research needs to focus on increasing MRI sensitivity and bringing added value to clinical nomograms at patient level.",2469
37955669,Performance of artificial intelligence in 7533 consecutive prevalent screening mammograms from the BreastScreen Australia program.,European radiology,2024,"To assess the performance of an artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm in the Australian mammography screening program which routinely uses two independent readers with arbitration of discordant results. A total of 7533 prevalent round mammograms from 2017 were available for analysis. The AI program classified mammograms into deciles on the basis of breast cancer (BC) risk. BC diagnoses, including invasive BC (IBC) and ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), included those from the prevalent round, interval cancers, and cancers identified in the subsequent screening round two years later. Performance was assessed by sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and the proportion of women recalled by the radiologists and identified as higher risk by AI. Radiologists identified 54 women with IBC and 13 with DCIS with a recall rate of 9.7%. In contrast, 51 of 54 of the IBCs and 12/13 cases of DCIS were within the higher AI score group (score 10), a recall equivalent of 10.6% (a difference of 0.9% (CI -0.03 to 1.89%, p = 0.06). When IBCs were identified in the 2017 round, interval cancers classified as false negatives or with minimal signs in 2017, and cancers from the 2019 round were combined, the radiologists identified 54/67 and 59/67 were in the highest risk AI category (sensitivity 80.6% and 88.06 % respectively, a difference that was not different statistically). As the performance of AI was comparable to that of expert radiologists, future AI roles in screening could include replacing one reader and supporting arbitration, reducing workload and false positive results. AI analysis of consecutive prevalent screening mammograms from the Australian BreastScreen program demonstrated the algorithm's ability to match the cancer detection of experienced radiologists, additionally identifying five interval cancers (false negatives), and the majority of the false positive recalls. • The AI program was almost as sensitive as the radiologists in terms of identifying prevalent lesions (51/54 for invasive breast cancer, 63/67 when including ductal carcinoma in situ). • If selected interval cancers and cancers identified in the subsequent screening round were included, the AI program identified more cancers than the radiologists (59/67 compared with 54/67, sensitivity 88.06 % and 80.6% respectively p = 0.24). • The high negative predictive value of a score of 1-9 would indicate a role for AI as a triage tool to reduce the recall rate (specifically false positives).",2512
37950082,Bronchiectasis is associated with lower lung function in lung cancer screening participants.,European radiology,2024,"Bronchiectasis is a frequent incidental finding on chest computed tomography (CT), but its relevance in lung cancer screening is not fully understood. We investigated the association between bronchiectasis and respiratory symptoms, pulmonary function, and emphysema in lung cancer screening participants with and without chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). We included 3260 (ex-)smokers from the Dutch-Belgian lung cancer screening trial (NELSON). Bronchiectasis was scored by chest radiologists. The relationship with pulmonary function (FEV1%predicted, FEV1/FVC), respiratory complaints (cough, dyspnea, wheezing, mucus hypersecretion), and CT-quantified emphysema (15th percentile) was examined with independent t-tests and multivariate regression. Bronchiectasis was present in 5.4% (n = 175/3260). There was no difference in prevalence between subjects with and without COPD (68/1121 [5.9%] vs. 109/2139 [5.1%]; p = .368). COPD subjects with bronchiectasis had a lower FEV1%predicted (76.2% vs. 85.0%; p < .001), lower FEV1/FVC (0.58 vs. 0.62; p < .001), and more emphysema (- 938 HU vs. - 930 HU; p = .001) than COPD subjects without bronchiectasis. In COPD subjects, bronchiectasis was independently associated with a lower FEV1%predicted (B =  - 7.7; CI [- 12.3, - 3.3]), lower FEV1/FVC (B =  - 2.5; CI [- 4.3, - 0.8]), more cough (OR 2.4; CI [1.3, 4.3]), more mucus hypersecretion (OR 1.8; CI [1.0, 3.1]) and more dyspnea (OR 2.3; CI [1.3, 3.9]). In those without COPD (n = 2139), bronchiectasis was associated with more cough, mucus hypersecretion, and wheezing, but not with deteriorating lung function. Bronchiectasis was present in 5.4% of our lung cancer screening participants and was associated with more respiratory symptoms and, in those with COPD, with lower lung function and more emphysema. In a lung cancer screening population, bronchiectasis has a prevalence of 5.4% with a mainly mild severity. This finding is of little clinical relevance unless mild COPD is also present. In those subjects, bronchiectasis was associated with a lower lung function, more respiratory symptoms, and more emphysema. • Bronchiectasis was found in 5.4% of lung cancer screening participants, consisting of (ex-)smokers with and without mild COPD. • In those with mild COPD, bronchiectasis was associated with a lower lung function, more respiratory symptoms, and more emphysema. • Incidental findings of mild bronchiectasis are not very relevant in a lung cancer screening population, unless COPD is also present.",2528
37947835,CT features combined with RECIST 1.1 criteria improve progression assessments of sunitinib-treated gastrointestinal stromal tumors.,European radiology,2024,"To explore the auxiliary value of combining CT features with existing response evaluation criteria in the prediction of progressive disease (PD) in gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) patients treated with sunitinib. Eighty-one patients with GISTs who received sunitinib were included in this retrospective multicenter study and divided into training and external validation cohorts. Progression at six months was determined as a reference standard. The predictive performance of the RECIST 1.1 and Choi criteria was compared. CT features at baseline and the first follow-up were analyzed. Logistic regression analyses were used to determine the most significant predictors and develop modified criteria. A total of 216 lesions showed a good response and 107 showed a poor response in 81 patients. The RECIST 1.1 criteria performed better than the Choi criteria in predicting progression (AUC, 0.75 vs. 0.69, p = 0.04). The expanded/intensified high-enhancement area, blurred tumor-tissue interface, and progressive enlarged vessels feeding or draining the mass (EVFDM) differed significantly between lesions with good and poor responses in the training cohort (p = 0.001, 0.003, and 0.000, respectively). Multivariate analysis revealed that the expanded/intensified high-enhancement area (p = 0.001), progressive EVFDM (p = 0.000), and RECIST PD (p = 0.000) were independent predictive factors. Modified RECIST (mRECIST) criteria were developed and showed significantly higher AUCs in the training and external validation cohorts than the RECIST 1.1 criteria (training: 0.81 vs. 0.73, p = 0.002; validation: 0.82 vs. 0.77, p = 0.04). The mRECIST criteria, combining CT features with the RECIST 1.1 criteria, demonstrated superior performance in the prediction of early progression in GIST patients receiving sunitinib. The mRECIST criteria, which combine CT features with the RECIST 1.1 criteria, may facilitate the early detection of progressive disease in GIST patients treated with sunitinib, thereby potentially guiding the timely switch to late-line medications or combination with surgical excision. • The RECIST 1.1 criteria outperformed the Choi criteria in identifying progression of GISTs in patients treated with sunitinib. • GISTs displayed different morphologic features on CT depending on how they responded to sunitinib. • Combining CT morphologic features with the RECIST 1.1 criteria allowed for the prompt and accurate identification of progressing GIST lesions.",2484
37938386,Population-wide evaluation of artificial intelligence and radiologist assessment of screening mammograms.,European radiology,2024,"To validate an AI system for standalone breast cancer detection on an entire screening population in comparison to first-reading breast radiologists. All mammography screenings performed between August 4, 2014, and August 15, 2018, in the Region of Southern Denmark with follow-up within 24 months were eligible. Screenings were assessed as normal or abnormal by breast radiologists through double reading with arbitration. For an AI decision of normal or abnormal, two AI-score cut-off points were applied by matching at mean sensitivity (AI The sample included 249,402 screenings (149,495 women) and 2033 breast cancers (72.6% screen-detected cancers, 27.4% interval cancers). AI Standalone AI can detect breast cancer at an accuracy level equivalent to the standard of first readers when the AI threshold point was matched at first reader specificity. However, AI and first readers detected a different composition of cancers. Replacing first readers with AI with an appropriate cut-off score could be feasible. AI-detected cancers not detected by radiologists suggest a potential increase in the number of cancers detected if AI is implemented to support double reading within screening, although the clinicopathological characteristics of detected cancers would not change significantly. • Standalone AI cancer detection was compared to first readers in a double-read mammography screening population. • Standalone AI matched at first reader specificity showed no statistically significant difference in overall accuracy but detected different cancers. • With an appropriate threshold, AI-integrated screening can increase the number of detected cancers with similar clinicopathological characteristics.",1708

The prospective OTST comparing double reading DBT vs. DM had paired design with four parallel arms: DM, DM + computer aided detection, DBT + DM, and DBT + synthetic mammography. Eight radiologists interpreted images in batches using a 5-point scale. Reading time was automatically recorded. A retrospective reader study including four radiologists classified screen-detected cancers with at least one false-negative score and screening examinations of interval cancers as negative, non-specific minimal sign, significant minimal sign, and missed; the two latter groups are defined ""actionable."" Statistics included chi-square, Fisher's exact, McNemar's, and Mann-Whitney U tests. Discordant rate (cancer missed by one reader) for screen-detected cancers was overall comparable (DBT (31% [71/227]) and DM (30% [52/175]), p = .81), significantly lower at DBT for spiculated cancers (DBT, 19% [20/106] vs. DM, 36% [38/106], p = .003), but high (28/49 = 57%, p = 0.001) for DBT-only detected spiculated cancers. Reading time and sensitivity varied among readers. False-negative DBT-only detected spiculated cancers had shorter reading time than true-negatives in 46% (13/28). Retrospective evaluation classified the following DBT exams ""actionable"": three missed by both readers, 95% (39/41) of discordant cancers detected by both modes, all 30 discordant DBT-only cancers, 25% (13/51) of interval cancers. Discordant rate was overall comparable for DBT and DM, significantly lower at DBT for spiculated cancers, but high for DBT-only detected spiculated lesions. Most false-negative screen-detected DBT were classified as ""actionable."" Retrospective evaluation of false-negative interpretations from the Oslo Tomosynthesis Screening Trial shows that most discordant and several interval cancers could have been detected at screening. This underlines the potential for modern AI-based reading aids and triage, as high-volume screening is a demanding task. • Digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) screening is more sensitive and has higher specificity compared to digital mammography screening, but high-volume DBT screening is a demanding task which can result in high discordance rate among readers. • Independent double reading DBT screening had overall comparable discordance rate as digital mammography, lower for spiculated masses seen on both modalities, and higher for small spiculated cancer seen only on DBT. • Almost all discordant digital breast tomosynthesis-detected cancers (72 of 74) and 25% (13 of 51) of the interval cancers in the Oslo Tomosynthesis Screening Trial were retrospectively classified as actionable and could have been detected by the readers.",2965
37938383,Improving mammography interpretation for both novice and experienced readers: a comparative study of two commercial artificial intelligence software.,European radiology,2024,"To evaluate the improvement of mammography interpretation for novice and experienced radiologists assisted by two commercial AI software. We compared the performance of two AI software (AI-1 and AI-2) in two experienced and two novice readers for 200 mammographic examinations (80 cancer cases). Two reading sessions were conducted within 4 weeks. The readers rated the likelihood of malignancy (range, 1-7) and the percentage probability of malignancy (range, 0-100%), with and without AI assistance. Differences in AUROC, sensitivity, and specificity were analyzed. Mean AUROC increased in both novice (0.86 to 0.90 with AI-1 [p = 0.005]; 0.91 with AI-2 [p < 0.001]) and experienced readers (0.87 to 0.92 with AI-1 [p < 0.001]; 0.90 with AI-2 [p = 0.004]). Sensitivities increased from 81.3 to 88.8% with AI-1 (p = 0.027) and to 91.3% with AI-2 (p = 0.005) in novice readers, and from 81.9 to 90.6% with AI-1 (p = 0.001) and to 87.5% with AI-2 (p = 0.016) in experienced readers. Specificity did not decrease significantly in both novice (p > 0.999, both) and experienced readers (p > 0.999 with AI-1 and 0.282 with AI-2). There was no significant difference in the performance change depending on the type of AI software (p > 0.999). Commercial AI software improved the diagnostic performance of both novice and experienced readers. The type of AI software used did not significantly impact performance changes.

37938382,Development of a CT radiomics nomogram for preoperative prediction of Ki-67 index in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma: a two-center retrospective study.,European radiology,2024,"To develop and validate a contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT)-based radiomics nomogram for the preoperative evaluation of Ki-67 proliferation status in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). In this two-center retrospective study, a total of 181 patients (95 in the training cohort; 42 in the testing cohort, and 44 in the external validation cohort) with PDAC who underwent CECT examination were included. Radiomic features were extracted from portal venous phase images. The radiomics signatures were built by using two feature-selecting methods (relief and recursive feature elimination) and four classifiers (support vector machine, naive Bayes, linear discriminant analysis (LDA), and logistic regression (LR)). Multivariate LR was used to build a clinical model and radiomics-clinical nomogram. The predictive performances of the models were evaluated using area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and decision curve analysis (DCA). The relief selector and LDA classifier using twelve features built the optimal radiomics signature, with AUCs of 0.948, 0.927, and 0.824 in the training, testing, and external validation cohorts, respectively. The radiomics-clinical nomogram incorporating the optimal radiomics signature, CT-reported lymph node status, and CA19-9 showed better predictive performance with AUCs of 0.976, 0.955, and 0.882 in the training, testing, and external validation cohorts, respectively. The calibration curve and DCA demonstrated goodness-of-fit and improved benefits in clinical practice of the nomogram. The radiomics-clinical nomogram is an effective and non-invasive computer-aided tool to predict the Ki-67 expression status in patients with PDAC. The radiomics-clinical nomogram is an effective and non-invasive computer-aided tool to predict the Ki-67 expression status in patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. The radiomics analysis could be helpful to predict Ki-67 expression status in patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). The radiomics-clinical nomogram integrated with the radiomics signature, clinical data, and CT radiological features could significantly improve the differential diagnosis of Ki-67 expression status. The radiomics-clinical nomogram showed satisfactory calibration and net benefit for discriminating high and low Ki-67 expression status in PDAC.",2363

We included data from 17,614 women diagnosed with invasive breast cancer as a result of participation in BreastScreen Norway, 1996-2020. Data on mammographic features (mass, spiculated mass, architectural distortion, asymmetric density, density with calcification and calcification alone), tumour diameter and cause of death was obtained from the Cancer Registry of Norway. Cox regression was used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for breast cancer death by mammographic features using spiculated mass as reference, adjusting for age, tumour diameter and lymph node status. All analyses were dichotomised by tumour diameter (small versus large). Mean age at diagnosis was 60.8 (standard deviation, SD=5.8) for 10,160 women with small tumours and 60.0 (SD=5.8) years for 7454 women with large tumours. The number of breast cancer deaths was 299 and 634, respectively. Mean time from diagnosis to death was 8.7 (SD=5.0) years for women with small tumours and 7.2 (4.6) years for women with large tumours. Using spiculated mass as reference, adjusted HR for breast cancer death among women with small tumours was 2.48 (95% CI 1.67-3.68) for calcification alone, while HR for women with large tumours was 1.30 (95% CI 1.02-1.66) for density with calcification. Small screen-detected invasive cancers presenting as calcification and large screen-detected cancers presenting as density with calcification were associated with the highest risk of breast cancer death. Small tumours (<15 mm) presented as calcification alone and large tumours (≥ 15 mm) presented as density with calcification were associated with the highest risk of breast cancer death among women with screen-detected invasive breast cancer diagnosed 1996-2020. • Women diagnosed with invasive screen-detected breast cancer 1996-2020 were analysed. • Small screen-detected cancers presenting as calcification alone resulted in the highest risk of breast cancer death. • Large screen-detected cancers presenting as density with calcification resulted in the highest risk of breast cancer death.",2265
37935443,"Method of primary breast cancer detection and the disease-free interval, adjusting for lead time.",Journal of the National Cancer Institute,2024,"Little is known about the impact of screen-detected breast cancer compared with clinically detected breast cancer on the disease-free interval (ie, free from locoregional recurrences, distant metastasis, contralateral breast cancer). Moreover, it is thought that most studies overestimate the beneficial effect of screening, as they do not adjust for lead time. We investigated the association between method of breast cancer detection and disease-free interval, taking lead time into account. Women aged 50-76 years, diagnosed with breast cancer between 2005 and 2008 were selected from the Netherlands Cancer Registry. Women diagnosed in 2005 were divided into screen-detected and clinically detected cancer and had a follow-up of 10 years (2005 cohort). Women diagnosed in 2006-2008 were divided into screen-detected, interval, and nonscreen-related cancer and had a follow-up of 5 years (2006-2008 cohort). A previously published method was used to adjust for lead time. Analyses were repeated correcting for confounding variables instead of lead time. The 2005 cohort included 6215 women. Women with screen-detected cancer had an improved disease-free interval compared with women with clinically detected cancer (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.77, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.68 to 0.87). The 2006-2008 cohort included 15 176 women. Women with screen-detected or interval cancer had an improved disease-free interval compared with women with nonscreen-related cancer (HR = 0.76, 95% CI = 0.66 to 0.88; HR = 0.88, 95% CI = 0.78 to 0.99, respectively). Correcting for confounders instead of lead time did not change associations. Women with screen-detected cancer had an improved disease-free interval compared with women with a nonscreen-related or clinically detected cancer, after correction for lead time.",1809
37934100,Development of a Model including MRI Features for Predicting Advanced-stage Recurrence of Hepatocellular Carcinoma after Liver Resection.,Radiology,2023,"Background Identifying patients at high risk for advanced-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) recurrence after liver resection may improve patient survival. Purpose To develop a model including MRI features for predicting postoperative advanced-stage HCC recurrence. Materials and Methods This single-center, retrospective study includes consecutive adult patients who underwent preoperative contrast-enhanced MRI and curative-intent resection for early- to intermediate-stage HCC (from December 2011 to April 2021). Three radiologists evaluated 52 qualitative features on MRI scans. In the training set, Fine-Gray proportional subdistribution hazard analysis was performed to identify clinical, laboratory, imaging, pathologic, and surgical variables to include in the predictive model. In the test set, the concordance index (C-index) was computed to compare the developed model with current staging systems. The Kaplan-Meier survival curves were compared using the log-rank test. Results The study included 532 patients (median age, 54 years; IQR, 46-62 years; 465 male patients), 302 patients from the training set (median age, 54 years; IQR, 46-63 years; 265 male patients), and 128 patients from the test set (median age, 53 years; IQR, 46-63 years; 108 male patients). Advanced-stage recurrence was observed in 38 of 302 (12.6%) and 15 of 128 (11.7%) of patients from the training and test sets, respectively. Serum neutrophil count (10",1444
37932389,Added value of the EUSOBI diffusion levels in breast MRI.,European radiology,2024,"To investigate whether using the diffusion levels (DLs) proposed by the European Society of Breast Imaging (EUSOBI) improves the diagnostic accuracy of breast MRI. This retrospective study included 145 women who, between September 2019 and June 2020, underwent breast 1.5-T MRI with DWI. Reader 1 and reader 2 (R1-R2) independently assessed breast lesions using the BI-RADS on dynamic contrast-enhanced imaging and T2-weighted imaging. DWI was subsequently disclosed, allowing readers able to measure lesions ADC and subjectively express the overall risk of malignancy on a 1-5 Likert scale. ADCs were interpreted as a range of values corresponding to the EUSOBI DLs. The analysis evaluated the inter-reader agreement in measuring ADC and DLs, the per-DL malignancy rate, and accuracy for malignancy using ROC analysis against histological examination or a 3-year follow-up. Lesions were malignant and showed non-mass enhancement in 67.7% and 76.1% of cases, respectively. ADC was measurable in 63.2%/66.7% of lesions (R1/R2), with a minimal discrepancy on Bland-Altman analysis and 0.948 (95%CI 0.925-0.965)/0.989 (95%CI 0.988-0.991) intraclass correlation coefficient in measuring ADC/DLs. The malignancy rate (R1/R2) increased from 0.5/0.5% (""very high"" DL) to 96.0/96.8% (""very low"" DL), as expected. Likert categorization showed larger areas under the curve than the BI-RADS for both R1 (0.91 versus 0.87; p = 0.0208) and R2 (0.91 versus 0.89; p = 0.1171), with improved specificity (81.5% versus 78.5% for R1 and 84.4% versus 81.2% for R2). Though ADC was not measurable in about one-third of lesions, DLs were categorized with excellent inter-reader agreement, improving the specificity for malignancy. DLs proposed by the EUSOBI are a reproducible tool to interpret the ADC of breast lesions and, in turn, to improve the specificity of breast MRI and reduce unnecessary breast biopsies. • The European Society of Breast Imaging proposed diffusion levels for the interpretation of the apparent diffusion coefficient in diffusion-weighted imaging of the breast. • Adding diffusion levels to the interpretation of magnetic resonance imaging improved the diagnostic accuracy for breast cancer, especially in terms of specificity. • Diffusion levels can favor a more widespread and standardized use of diffusion-weighted imaging of the breast.",2346
37930408,Nodal staging with MRI after neoadjuvant chemo-radiotherapy for locally advanced rectal cancer: a fast and reliable method.,European radiology,2024,"In patients with locally advanced rectal carcinoma (LARC), negative nodal status after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT) may allow for rectum-sparing protocols rather than total mesorectal excision; however, current MRI criteria for nodal staging have suboptimal accuracy. The aim of this study was to compare the diagnostic accuracy of different MRI dimensional criteria for nodal staging after nCRT in patients with LARC. Patients who underwent MRI after nCRT for LARC followed by surgery were retrospectively included and divided into a training and a validation cohort of 100 and 39 patients, respectively. Short-, long-, and cranial-caudal axes and volume of the largest mesorectal node and nodal status based on European Society of Gastrointestinal Radiology consensus guidelines (i.e., ESGAR method) were assessed by two radiologists independently. Inter-reader agreement was assessed in the training cohort. Histopathology was the reference standard. ROC curves and the best cut-off were calculated, and accuracies compared with the McNemar test. The study population included 139 patients (median age 62 years [IQR 55-72], 94 men). Inter-reader agreement was high for long axis (κ = 0.81), volume (κ = 0.85), and ESGAR method (κ = 0.88) and low for short axis (κ = 0.11). Accuracy was similar (p > 0.05) for long axis, volume, and ESGAR method both in the training (71%, 74%, and 65%, respectively) and in the validation (83%, 78%, and 75%, respectively) cohorts. Accuracy of the measurement of long axis and volume of the largest lymph node is not inferior to the ESGAR method for nodal staging after nCRT in LARC. In MRI restaging of rectal cancer, measurement of the long axis or volume of largest mesorectal lymph node after preoperative chemoradiotherapy is a faster and reliable alternative to ESGAR criteria for nodal staging. • Current MRI criteria for nodal staging in locally advanced rectal cancer after chemo-radiotherapy have suboptimal accuracy and are time-consuming. • Measurement of long axis or volume of the largest mesorectal lymph node on MRI showed good accuracy for assessment of loco-regional nodal status in locally advanced rectal cancer. • MRI measurement of the long axis and volume of largest mesorectal lymph node after chemo-radiotherapy could be a faster and reliable alternative to ESGAR criteria for nodal staging.",2360
37926742,Multiparametric MRI-based VI-RADS: can it predict 1- to 5-year recurrence of bladder cancer?,European radiology,2024,"To evaluate whether Vesical Imaging-Reporting And Data System (VI-RADS) scores based on multiparametric MRI (mp-MRI) can predict bladder cancer (BCa) recurrence. In this retrospective study, 284 patients with pathologically confirmed bladder neoplasms from November 2011 to October 2020 were included. Two radiologists blindly and independently scored mp-MRI scans according to VI-RADS. Scoring inconsistency was resolved in consensus. The latest follow-up was completed in December 2022. Pearson's correlation analyses, independent-sample t-tests, and receiver operating characteristic analyses were performed to assess the efficacy of VI-RADS score for the 1- to 5-year recurrence prognostication. Based on the latest follow-up, 37 (of 284, 13.0%), 69 (of 284, 24.3%), 70 (of 234, 29.9%), 72 (of 190, 37.9%), and 63 (of 135, 46.7%) patients had cancer recurrence at 1- to 5-year follow-up, respectively. VI-RADS scores showed significantly intergroup differences between recurrent and nonrecurrent cases during 1- to 4-year surveillance (p < 0.05). The recurrence-free survival was significantly higher in patients with VI-RADS scores of 1 or 2, compared to those with scores of 3, 4, or 5 (p < 0.05). Areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves for 1- to 5-year recurrence prediction were 0.744, 0.686, 0.656, 0.595, and 0.536, respectively. VI-RADS score of 3 or more was the threshold for 1-year recurrence assessment, and VI-RADS more than 3 was the cutoff for 2-year recurrence prediction. VI-RADS score has potential in preoperative prognostication of BCa recurrence, but its predictive power decreases over time. VI-RADS has potential in bladder cancer recurrence assessment, but its prognostic value decreases over time. Patients with VI-RADS ≥ 3 may be more likely to recur in 1 or 2 years postoperatively, thus should be performed with intensive surveillances. • VI-RADS scores had significant differences in 1- to 4-year recurrent and nonrecurrent patient groups. • Patients with VI-RADS scores of ≤ 2 showed more favorable recurrence-free survival outcomes. • The prognostic value of VI-RADS score decreased over time for bladder cancer recurrence prediction.",2186

Here, we present the experience of microwave ablation (MWA) of lung nodules in the HOR. We reviewed patients who underwent image-guide percutaneous MWA for lung nodules in the HOR under general anaesthesia between July 2020 and July 2022. The workflow in the HOR including the pre-procedure preparation, anaesthesia consideration, operation methods, and postoperative care was clearly described. Forty lesions in 33 patients who underwent MWA under general anaesthesia (GA) in the HOR were analysed. Twenty-seven patients had a single pulmonary nodule, and the remaining six patients had multiple nodules. The median procedure time was 41.0 min, and the median ablation time per lesion was 6.75 min. The median global operation room time was 115.0 min. The median total dose area product was 14881 μGym Thermal ablation of pulmonary nodules under GA in the HOR can be performed safely and efficiently if we follow the workflow provided. The procedure provides an alternative to managing pulmonary nodules in patients. Thermal ablation of pulmonary nodules under GA in the HOR can be performed safely and efficiently if the provided workflow is followed. • We tested the feasibility of microwave ablation of lung lesions performed in a hybrid operating room. • To this end, we provide a description of microwave ablation of the lung under cone-beam CT localisation. • We describe a workflow by which ablation of the pulmonary nodule can be performed safely under general anaesthesia.",1652
37926740,MRI radiomics may predict early tumor recurrence in patients with sinonasal squamous cell carcinoma.,European radiology,2024,"Sinonasal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) follows a poor prognosis with high tendency for local recurrence. We aimed to evaluate whether MRI radiomics can predict early local failure in sinonasal SCC. Sixty-eight consecutive patients with node-negative sinonasal SCC (January 2005-December 2020) were enrolled, allocated to the training (n = 47) and test sets (n = 21). Early local failure, which occurred within 12 months of completion of initial treatment, was the primary endpoint. For clinical features (age, location, treatment modality, and clinical T stage), binary logistic regression analysis was performed. For 186 extracted radiomic features, different feature selections and classifiers were combined to create two prediction models: (1) a pure radiomics model; and (2) a combined model with clinical features and radiomics. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) were calculated and compared using DeLong's method. Early local failure occurred in 38.3% (18/47) and 23.8% (5/21) in the training and test sets, respectively. We identified several radiomic features which were strongly associated with early local failure. In the test set, both the best-performing radiomics model and the combined model (clinical + radiomic features) yielded higher AUCs compared to the clinical model (AUC, 0.838 vs. 0.438, p = 0.020; 0.850 vs. 0.438, p = 0.016, respectively). The performances of the best-performing radiomics model and the combined model did not differ significantly (AUC, 0.838 vs. 0.850, p = 0.904). MRI radiomics integrated with a machine learning classifier may predict early local failure in patients with sinonasal SCC. MRI radiomics intergrated with machine learning classifiers may predict early local failure in sinonasal squamous cell carcinomas more accurately than the clinical model. • A subset of radiomic features which showed significant association with early local failure in patients with sinonasal squamous cell carcinomas was identified. • MRI radiomics integrated with machine learning classifiers can predict early local failure with high accuracy, which was validated in the test set (area under the curve = 0.838). • The combined clinical and radiomics model yielded superior performance for early local failure prediction compared to that of the radiomics (area under the curve 0.850 vs. 0.838 in the test set), without a statistically significant difference.",2426
37926739,Diffusion MRI is valuable in brainstem glioma genotyping with quantitative measurements of white matter tracts.,European radiology,2024,"To investigate the value of diffusion MRI (dMRI) in H3K27M genotyping of brainstem glioma (BSG). A primary cohort of BSG patients with dMRI data (b = 0, 1000 and 2000 s/mm At total of 117 patients (80 H3K27M-mutant) were included in the primary cohort. In total, 29 tumor histogram features and 41 WM tract measurements were selected for subsequent genotyping model construction. Incorporating WM tract measurements significantly improved diagnostic performances (p < 0.05). The model incorporating tumor and WM features from both DKI and DTI metrics showed the best performance (AUC = 0.9311). The nomogram combining this dMRI model and clinical variables achieved AUCs of 0.9321 and 0.8951 in the primary and validation cohort respectively. dMRI is valuable in BSG genotyping. Tumor diffusion histogram features are useful in genotyping, and WM tract measurements are more valuable in improving genotyping performance. This study found that diffusion MRI is valuable in predicting H3K27M mutation in brainstem gliomas, which is helpful to realize the noninvasive detection of brainstem glioma genotypes and improve the diagnosis of brainstem glioma. • Diffusion MRI has significant value in brainstem glioma H3K27M genotyping, and models with satisfactory performances were built. • Whole-tumor diffusion histogram features are useful in H3K27M genotyping, and quantitative measurements of white matter tracts are valuable as they have the potential to improve model performance. • The model combining the most discriminative diffusion MRI model and clinical variables can help make clinical decision.",1603
37926738,CT-based quantification of trachea shape to detect invasion by thyroid cancer.,European radiology,2024,"This study aims to develop a CT-based method for quantifying tracheal shape and evaluating its ability to distinguish between cases with or without tracheal invasion in patients with thyroid carcinoma. A total of 116 quantitative shape features, including 56 geometric moments and 60 bounding shape features, were defined. The tracheal lumen was semi-automatically defined with a CT threshold of less than - 500 HU. Three contiguous slices with the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd smallest trachea lumen areas were contiguously selected, and the appropriate number of slices to be included was determined. Fifty-six patients with differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC) invading the trachea and 22 patients with DTC but without invasion were retrospectively included. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was applied to select the representative shape features and determine the optimal threshold. 23.3%, 25.9%, and 24.1% of the features displayed an area under the ROC curve (AUC) ≥ 0.800 when derived from 1, 2, and 3 slices, respectively. Calculating feature values from two slices with the 1st and 2nd smallest tracheal lumen area were considered appropriate. Six final features, including 3 geometric moments and 3 bounding shape features, were selected to determine the tracheal invasion status of DTC and displayed AUCs of 0.875-0.918, accuracies of 0.821-0.891, sensitivities of 0.813-0.893, and specificities of 0.818-0.932, outperforming the visual evaluation results. Geometric moments and bounding shape features can quantify the tracheal shape and are reliable for identifying DTC tracheal invasion. The selected features quantified the extent of tracheal deformity in DTC patients with and without tracheal invasion. Six geometric features provide a non-invasive, semi-automated evaluation of the tracheal invasion status of thyroid cancer. • A novel method for quantifying tracheal shape using 56 geometric moments and 60 bounding shape features was developed. • Six features identify tracheal invasion by thyroid carcinoma. • The selected features quantified the extent of tracheal deformity in differentiated thyroid carcinoma patients with and without tracheal invasion.",2184
37922931,A CT-based radiomics classification model for the prediction of histological type and tumour grade in retroperitoneal sarcoma (RADSARC-R): a retrospective multicohort analysis.,The Lancet. Oncology,2023,"Retroperitoneal sarcomas are tumours with a poor prognosis. Upfront characterisation of the tumour is difficult, and under-grading is common. Radiomics has the potential to non-invasively characterise the so-called radiological phenotype of tumours. We aimed to develop and independently validate a CT-based radiomics classification model for the prediction of histological type and grade in retroperitoneal leiomyosarcoma and liposarcoma. A retrospective discovery cohort was collated at our centre (Royal Marsden Hospital, London, UK) and an independent validation cohort comprising patients recruited in the phase 3 STRASS study of neoadjuvant radiotherapy in retroperitoneal sarcoma. Patients aged older than 18 years with confirmed primary leiomyosarcoma or liposarcoma proceeding to surgical resection with available contrast-enhanced CT scans were included. Using the discovery dataset, a CT-based radiomics workflow was developed, including manual delineation, sub-segmentation, feature extraction, and predictive model building. Separate probabilistic classifiers for the prediction of histological type and low versus intermediate or high grade tumour types were built and tested. Independent validation was then performed. The primary objective of the study was to develop radiomic classification models for the prediction of retroperitoneal leiomyosarcoma and liposarcoma type and histological grade. 170 patients recruited between Oct 30, 2016, and Dec 23, 2020, were eligible in the discovery cohort and 89 patients recruited between Jan 18, 2012, and April 10, 2017, were eligible in the validation cohort. In the discovery cohort, the median age was 63 years (range 27-89), with 83 (49%) female and 87 (51%) male patients. In the validation cohort, median age was 59 years (range 33-77), with 46 (52%) female and 43 (48%) male patients. The highest performing model for the prediction of histological type had an area under the receiver operator curve (AUROC) of 0·928 on validation, based on a feature set of radiomics and approximate radiomic volume fraction. The highest performing model for the prediction of histological grade had an AUROC of 0·882 on validation, based on a radiomics feature set. Our validated radiomics model can predict the histological type and grade of retroperitoneal sarcomas with excellent performance. This could have important implications for improving diagnosis and risk stratification in retroperitoneal sarcomas.

37924344,Training and external validation of pre-treatment FDG PET-CT-based models for outcome prediction in anal squamous cell carcinoma.,European radiology,2024,"The incidence of anal squamous cell carcinoma (ASCC) is increasing worldwide, with a significant proportion of patients treated with curative intent having recurrence. The ability to accurately predict progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) would allow for development of personalised treatment strategies. The aim of the study was to train and external test radiomic/clinical feature derived time-to-event prediction models. Consecutive patients with ASCC treated with curative intent at two large tertiary referral centres with baseline FDG PET-CT were included. Radiomic feature extraction was performed using LIFEx software on the pre-treatment PET-CT. Two distinct predictive models for PFS and OS were trained and tuned at each of the centres, with the best performing models externally tested on the other centres' patient cohort. A total of 187 patients were included from centre 1 (mean age 61.6 ± 11.5 years, median follow up 30 months, PFS events = 57/187, OS events = 46/187) and 257 patients were included from centre 2 (mean age 62.6 ± 12.3 years, median follow up 35 months, PFS events = 70/257, OS events = 54/257). The best performing model for PFS and OS was achieved using a Cox regression model based on age and metabolic tumour volume (MTV) with a training c-index of 0.7 and an external testing c-index of 0.7 (standard error = 0.4). A combination of patient age and MTV has been demonstrated using external validation to have the potential to predict OS and PFS in ASCC patients. A Cox regression model using patients' age and metabolic tumour volume showed good predictive potential for progression-free survival in external testing. The benefits of a previous radiomics model published by our group could not be confirmed on external testing. • A predictive model based on patient age and metabolic tumour volume showed potential to predict overall survival and progression-free survival and was validated on an external test cohort. • The methodology used to create a predictive model from age and metabolic tumour volume was repeatable using external cohort data. • The predictive ability of positron emission tomography-computed tomography-derived radiomic features diminished when the influence of metabolic tumour volume was accounted for.",2288
37921926,HUNCHEST-II contributes to a shift to earlier-stage lung cancer detection: final results of a nationwide screening program.,European radiology,2024,"The introduction of low-dose CT (LDCT) altered the landscape of lung cancer (LC) screening and contributed to the reduction of mortality rates worldwide. Here we report the final results of HUNCHEST-II, the largest population-based LDCT screening program in Hungary, including the screening and diagnostic outcomes, and the characteristics of the LC cases. A total of 4215 high-risk individuals aged between 50 and 75 years with a smoking history of at least 25 pack-years were assigned to undergo LDCT screening. Screening outcomes were determined based on the volume, growth, and volume doubling time of pulmonary nodules or masses. The clinical stage distribution of screen-detected cancers was compared with two independent practice-based databases consisting of unscreened LC patients. The percentage of negative and indeterminate tests at baseline were 74.2% and 21.7%, respectively, whereas the prevalence of positive LDCT results was 4.1%. Overall, 76 LC patients were diagnosed throughout the screening rounds (1.8% of total participants), out of which 62 (1.5%) patients were already identified in the first screening round. The overall positive predictive value of a positive test was 58%. Most screen-detected malignancies were stage I LCs (60.7%), and only 16.4% of all cases could be classified as stage IV disease. The percentage of early-stage malignancies was significantly higher among HUNCHEST-II screen-detected individuals than among the LC patients in the National Koranyi Institute of Pulmonology's archive or the Hungarian Cancer Registry (p < 0.001). HUNCHEST-II demonstrates that LDCT screening for LC facilitates early diagnosis, thus arguing in favor of introducing systematic LC screening in Hungary. HUNCHEST-II is the so-far largest population-based low-dose CT screening program in Hungary. A positive test's overall positive predictive value was 58%, and most screen-detected malignancies were early-stage lesions. These results pave the way for expansive systematic screening in the region. • Conducted in 18 medical facilities, HUNCHEST-II is the so far largest population-based low-dose CT screening program in Hungary. • The vast majority of screen-detected malignancies were early-stage lung cancers, and the overall positive predictive value of a positive test was 58%. • HUNCHEST-II facilitates early diagnosis, thus arguing in favor of introducing systematic lung cancer screening in Hungary.",2433
37921924,Diagnostic performance of Node Reporting and Data System (Node-RADS) for regional lymph node staging of gastric cancer by CT.,European radiology,2024,"Diagnostic performance of imaging for regional lymph node assessment in gastric cancer is still limited, and there is a lack of consensus on radiological evaluation. At the same time, there is an increasing demand for structured reporting using Reporting and Data Systems (RADS) to standardize oncological imaging. We aimed at investigating the diagnostic performance of Node-RADS compared to the use of various individual criteria for assessing regional lymph nodes in gastric cancer using histopathology as reference. In this retrospective single-center study, consecutive 91 patients (median age, 66 years, range 33-91 years, 54 men) with CT scans and histologically proven gastric adenocarcinoma were assessed using Node-RADS assigning scores from 1 to 5 for the likelihood of regional lymph node metastases. Additionally, different Node-RADS criteria as well as subcategories of altered border contour (lobulated, spiculated, indistinct) were assessed individually. Sensitivity, specificity, and Youden's index were calculated for Node-RADS scores, and all criteria investigated. Interreader agreement was calculated using Cohen's kappa. Among all criteria, best performance was found for Node-RADS scores ≥ 3 and ≥ 4 with a sensitivity/specificity/Youden's index of 56.8%/90.7%/0.48 and 48.6%/98.1%/0.47, respectively, both with substantial interreader agreement (κ = 0.73 and 0.67, p < 0.01). Among individual criteria, the best performance was found for short-axis diameter of 10 mm with sensitivity/specificity/Youden's index of 56.8%/87.0%/0.44 (κ = 0.65, p < 0.01). This study shows that structured reporting of combined size and configuration criteria of regional lymph nodes in gastric cancer slightly improves overall diagnostic performance compared to individual criteria including short-axis diameter alone. The results show an increase in specificity and unchanged sensitivity. The results of this study suggest that Node-RADS may be a suitable tool for structured reporting of regional lymph nodes in gastric cancer. • Assessment of lymph nodes in gastric cancer is still limited, and there is a lack of consensus on radiological evaluation. • Node-RADS in gastric cancer improves overall diagnostic performance compared to individual criteria including short-axis diameter. • Node-RADS may be a suitable tool for structured reporting of regional lymph nodes in gastric cancer.",2395

The 20-year cumulative incidence of breast cancer was 11.3% (95% CI, 10.7%-11.9%) among women with a false-positive result vs 7.3% (95% CI, 7.2%-7.5%) among those without, with an adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 1.61 (95% CI, 1.54-1.68). The corresponding HRs were higher among women aged 60 to 75 years at the examination (HR, 2.02; 95% CI, 1.80-2.26) and those with lower mammographic breast density (HR, 4.65; 95% CI, 2.61-8.29). In addition, breast cancer risk was higher for women who underwent a biopsy at the recall (HR, 1.77; 95% CI, 1.63-1.92) than for those without a biopsy (HR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.43-1.60). Cancers after a false-positive result were more likely to be detected on the ipsilateral side of the false-positive result (HR, 1.92; 95% CI, 1.81-2.04) and were more common during the first 4 years of follow-up (HR, 2.57; 95% CI, 2.33-2.85 during the first 2 years; HR, 1.93; 95% CI, 1.76-2.12 at >2 to 4 years). No statistical difference was found for different tumor characteristics (except for larger tumor size). Furthermore, associated with the increased risk of breast cancer, women with a false-positive result had an 84% higher rate of breast cancer death than those without (HR, 1.84; 95% CI, 1.57-2.15). This study suggests that the risk of developing breast cancer after a false-positive mammography result differs by individual characteristics and follow-up. These findings can be used to develop individualized risk-based breast cancer screening after a false-positive result.",2682
37916978,A Fully Automated Deep-Learning Model for Predicting the Molecular Subtypes of Posterior Fossa Ependymomas Using T2-Weighted Images.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,2024,"We aimed to develop and validate a deep learning (DL) model to automatically segment posterior fossa ependymoma (PF-EPN) and predict its molecular subtypes [Group A (PFA) and Group B (PFB)] from preoperative MR images. We retrospectively identified 227 PF-EPNs (development and internal test sets) with available preoperative T2-weighted (T2w) MR images and molecular status to develop and test a 3D nnU-Net (referred to as T2-nnU-Net) for tumor segmentation and molecular subtype prediction. The network was externally tested using an external independent set [n = 40; subset-1 (n = 31) and subset-2 (n =9)] and prospectively enrolled cases [prospective validation set (n = 27)]. The Dice similarity coefficient was used to evaluate the segmentation performance. Receiver operating characteristic analysis for molecular subtype prediction was performed. For tumor segmentation, the T2-nnU-Net achieved a Dice score of 0.94 ± 0.02 in the internal test set. For molecular subtype prediction, the T2-nnU-Net achieved an AUC of 0.93 and accuracy of 0.89 in the internal test set, an AUC of 0.99 and accuracy of 0.93 in the external test set. In the prospective validation set, the model achieved an AUC of 0.93 and an accuracy of 0.89. The predictive performance of T2-nnU-Net was superior or comparable to that of demographic and multiple radiologic features (AUCs ranging from 0.87 to 0.95). A fully automated DL model was developed and validated to accurately segment PF-EPNs and predict molecular subtypes using only T2w MR images, which could help in clinical decision-making.",1578
37916956,"Discovery and Clinical Proof-of-Concept of RLY-2608, a First-in-Class Mutant-Selective Allosteric PI3Kα Inhibitor That Decouples Antitumor Activity from Hyperinsulinemia.",Cancer discovery,2024,"PIK3CA (PI3Kα) is a lipid kinase commonly mutated in cancer, including ∼40% of hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. The most frequently observed mutants occur in the kinase and helical domains. Orthosteric PI3Kα inhibitors suffer from poor selectivity leading to undesirable side effects, most prominently hyperglycemia due to inhibition of wild-type (WT) PI3Kα. Here, we used molecular dynamics simulations and cryo-electron microscopy to identify an allosteric network that provides an explanation for how mutations favor PI3Kα activation. A DNA-encoded library screen leveraging electron microscopy-optimized constructs, differential enrichment, and an orthosteric-blocking compound led to the identification of RLY-2608, a first-in-class allosteric mutant-selective inhibitor of PI3Kα. RLY-2608 inhibited tumor growth in PIK3CA-mutant xenograft models with minimal impact on insulin, a marker of dysregulated glucose homeostasis. RLY-2608 elicited objective tumor responses in two patients diagnosed with advanced hormone receptor-positive breast cancer with kinase or helical domain PIK3CA mutations, with no observed WT PI3Kα-related toxicities. Treatments for PIK3CA-mutant cancers are limited by toxicities associated with the inhibition of WT PI3Kα. Molecular dynamics, cryo-electron microscopy, and DNA-encoded libraries were used to develop RLY-2608, a first-in-class inhibitor that demonstrates mutant selectivity in patients. This marks the advance of clinical mutant-selective inhibition that overcomes limitations of orthosteric PI3Kα inhibitors. See related commentary by Gong and Vanhaesebroeck, p. 204 .

37914975,Discrimination of invasive lung adenocarcinoma from Lung-RADS category 2 nonsolid nodules through visual assessment: a retrospective study.,European radiology,2024,"Invasive adenocarcinomas (IADs) have been identified among nonsolid nodules (NSNs) assigned as Lung Imaging Reporting and Data System (Lung-RADS) category 2. This study used visual assessment for differentiating IADs from noninvasive lesions (NILs) in this category. This retrospective study included 222 patients with 242 NSNs, which were resected after preoperative computed tomography (CT)-guided dye localization. Visual assessment was performed by using the lung and bone window (BW) settings to classify NSNs into BW-visible (BWV) and BW-invisible (BWI) NSNs. In addition, nodule size, shape, border, CT attenuation, and location were evaluated and correlated with histopathological results. Logistic regression was performed for multivariate analysis. A p value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. A total of 242 NSNs (mean diameter, 7.6 ± 2.8 mm), including 166 (68.6%) BWV and 76 (31.4%) BWI NSNs, were included. IADs accounted for 31% (75) of the nodules. Only 4 (5.3%) IADs were identified in the BWI group and belonged to the lepidic-predominant (n = 3) and acinar-predominant (n = 1) subtypes. In univariate analysis for differentiating IADs from NILs, the nodule size, shape, CT attenuation, and visual classification exhibited statistical significance. Nodule size and visual classification were the significant predictors for IAD in multivariate analysis with logistic regression (p < 0.05). The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of visual classification in IAD prediction were 94.7%, 43.1%, 42.8%, and 94.7%, respectively. The window-based visual classification of NSNs is a simple and objective method to discriminate IADs from NILs. The present study shows that using the bone window to classify nonsolid nodules helps discriminate invasive adenocarcinoma from noninvasive lesions. • Evidence has shown the presence of lung adenocarcinoma in Lung-RADS category 2 nonsolid nodules. • Nonsolid nodules are classified into the bone window-visible and the bone window-invisible nonsolid nodules, and this classification differentiates invasive adenocarcinoma from noninvasive lesions. • The Lung-RADS category 2 nonsolid nodules are unlikely invasive adenocarcinoma if they show nonvisualization in the bone window.",2295
37907761,Diffusion-weighted imaging for determining response to neoadjuvant therapy in pancreatic cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,European radiology,2024,"To determine the role of diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) for predicting response to neoadjuvant therapy (NAT) in pancreatic cancer. MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases were searched for studies evaluating the performance of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) to assess response to NAT. Data extracted included ADC pre- and post-NAT, for predicting response as defined by imaging, histopathology, or clinical reference standards. ADC values were compared with standardized mean differences. Risk of bias was assessed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Studies (QUADAS-2). Of 337 studies, 7 were included in the analysis (161 patients). ADC values reported for the pre- and post-NAT assessments overlapped between responders and non-responders. One study reported inability of ADC increase after NAT for distinguishing responders and non-responders. A correlation with histopathological response was reported for pre- and post-NAT ADC in 4 studies. DWI's diagnostic performance was reported to be high in three studies, with a 91.6-100% sensitivity and 62.5-94.7% specificity. Finally, heterogeneity and high risk of bias were identified across studies, affecting the domains of patient selection, index test, reference standard, and flow and timing. DWI might be useful for determining response to NAT in pancreatic cancer. However, there are still too few studies on this matter, which are also heterogeneous and at high risk for bias. Further studies with standardized procedures for data acquisition and accurate reference standards are needed. Diffusion-weighted MRI might be useful for assessing response to neoadjuvant therapy in pancreatic cancer. However, further studies with robust data are needed to provide specific recommendations for clinical practice. •The role of DWI with ADC measurements for assessing response to neoadjuvant therapy in pancreatic cancer is still unclear. •Pre- and post-neoadjuvant therapy ADC values overlap between responders and non-responders. •DWI has a reported high diagnostic performance for determining response when using histopathological or clinical reference standards; however, studies are still few and at high risk for bias.",2198
37906014,International Expert Consensus on US Lexicon for Thyroid Nodules.,Radiology,2023,"Multiple US-based systems for risk stratification of thyroid nodules are in use worldwide. Unfortunately, the malignancy probability assigned to a nodule varies, and terms and definitions are not consistent, leading to confusion and making it challenging to compare study results and craft revisions. Consistent application of these systems is further hampered by interobserver variability in identifying the sonographic features on which they are founded. In 2018, an international multidisciplinary group of 19 physicians with expertise in thyroid sonography (termed the International Thyroid Nodule Ultrasound Working Group) was convened with the goal of developing an international system, tentatively called the International Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System, or I-TIRADS, in two phases: (phase I) creation of a lexicon and atlas of US descriptors of thyroid nodules and (phase II) development of a system that estimates the malignancy risk of a thyroid nodule. This article presents the methods and results of phase I. The purpose herein is to show what has been accomplished thus far, as well as generate interest in and support for this effort in the global thyroid community.",1193

We evaluated 52 237 women aged 40-79 years who underwent 2611 screening MRIs alone and 6518 supplemental MRI plus mammography pairs propensity score-matched to 65 810 screening mammograms. Rates per 1000 examinations of interval, advanced, and screen-detected early stage invasive cancers and false-positive recall and biopsy recommendation were estimated by breast density (nondense = almost entirely fatty or scattered fibroglandular densities; dense = heterogeneously/extremely dense) adjusting for registry, examination year, age, race and ethnicity, family history of breast cancer, and prior breast biopsy. Screen-detected early stage cancer rates were statistically higher for MRI plus mammography vs mammography for nondense (9.3 vs 2.9; difference = 6.4, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.5 to 10.3) and dense (7.5 vs 3.5; difference = 4.0, 95% CI = 1.4 to 6.7) breasts and for MRI vs MRI plus mammography for dense breasts (19.2 vs 7.5; difference = 11.7, 95% CI = 4.6 to 18.8). Interval rates were not statistically different for MRI plus mammography vs mammography for nondense (0.8 vs 0.5; difference = 0.4, 95% CI = -0.8 to 1.6) or dense breasts (1.5 vs 1.4; difference = 0.0, 95% CI = -1.2 to 1.3), nor were advanced cancer rates.

False-positive recall and biopsy recommendation rates were statistically higher for MRI groups than mammography alone. MRI screening with or without mammography increased rates of screen-detected early stage cancer and false-positives for women with dense breasts without a concomitant decrease in advanced or interval cancers.",2018
37891415,Reducing false positives in deep learning-based brain metastasis detection by using both gradient-echo and spin-echo contrast-enhanced MRI: validation in a multi-center diagnostic cohort.,European radiology,2024,"To develop a deep learning (DL) for detection of brain metastasis (BM) that incorporates both gradient- and turbo spin-echo contrast-enhanced MRI (dual-enhanced DL) and evaluate it in a clinical cohort in comparison with human readers and DL using gradient-echo-based imaging only (GRE DL). DL detection was developed using data from 200 patients with BM (training set) and tested in 62 (internal) and 48 (external) consecutive patients who underwent stereotactic radiosurgery and diagnostic dual-enhanced imaging (dual-enhanced DL) and later guide GRE imaging (GRE DL). The detection sensitivity and positive predictive value (PPV) were compared between two DLs. Two neuroradiologists independently analyzed BM and reference standards for BM were separately drawn by another neuroradiologist. The relative differences (RDs) from the reference standard BM numbers were compared between the DLs and neuroradiologists. Sensitivity was similar between GRE DL (93%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 90-96%) and dual-enhanced DL (92% [89-94%]). The PPV of the dual-enhanced DL was higher (89% [86-92%], p < .001) than that of GRE DL (76%, [72-80%]). GRE DL significantly overestimated the number of metastases (false positives; RD: 0.05, 95% CI: 0.00-0.58) compared with neuroradiologists (RD: 0.00, 95% CI: - 0.28, 0.15, p < .001), whereas dual-enhanced DL (RD: 0.00, 95% CI: 0.00-0.15) did not show a statistically significant difference from neuroradiologists (RD: 0.00, 95% CI: - 0.20-0.10, p = .913). The dual-enhanced DL showed improved detection of BM and reduced overestimation compared with GRE DL, achieving similar performance to neuroradiologists. The use of deep learning-based brain metastasis detection with turbo spin-echo imaging reduces false positive detections, aiding in the guidance of stereotactic radiosurgery when gradient-echo imaging alone is employed. •Deep learning for brain metastasis detection improved by using both gradient- and turbo spin-echo contrast-enhanced MRI (dual-enhanced deep learning). •Dual-enhanced deep learning increased true positive detections and reduced overestimation. •Dual-enhanced deep learning achieved similar performance to neuroradiologists for brain metastasis counts.",2223
37889272,Study of radiochemotherapy decision-making for young high-risk low-grade glioma patients using a macroscopic and microscopic combined radiomics model.,European radiology,2024,"As a few types of glioma, young high-risk low-grade gliomas (HRLGGs) have higher requirements for postoperative quality of life. Although adjuvant chemotherapy with delayed radiotherapy is the first treatment strategy for HRLGGs, not all HRLGGs benefit from it. Accurate assessment of chemosensitivity in HRLGGs is vital for making treatment choices. This study developed a multimodal fusion radiomics (MFR) model to support radiochemotherapy decision-making for HRLGGs. A MFR model combining macroscopic MRI and microscopic pathological images was proposed. Multiscale features including macroscopic tumor structure and microscopic histological layer and nuclear information were grabbed by unique paradigm, respectively. Then, these features were adaptively incorporated into the MFR model through attention mechanism to predict the chemosensitivity of temozolomide (TMZ) by means of objective response rate and progression free survival (PFS). Macroscopic tumor texture complexity and microscopic nuclear size showed significant statistical differences (p < 0.001) between sensitivity and insensitivity groups. The MFR model achieved stable prediction results, with an area under the curve of 0.950 (95% CI: 0.942-0.958), sensitivity of 0.833 (95% CI: 0.780-0.848), specificity of 0.929 (95% CI: 0.914-0.936), positive predictive value of 0.833 (95% CI: 0.811-0.860), and negative predictive value of 0.929 (95% CI: 0.914-0.934). The predictive efficacy of MFR was significantly higher than that of the reported molecular markers (p < 0.001). MFR was also demonstrated to be a predictor of PFS. A MFR model including radiomics and pathological features predicts accurately the response postoperative TMZ treatment. Our MFR model could identify young high-risk low-grade glioma patients who can have the most benefit from postoperative upfront temozolomide (TMZ) treatment. • Multimodal radiomics is proposed to support the radiochemotherapy of glioma. • Some macro and micro image markers related to tumor chemotherapy sensitivity are revealed. • The proposed model surpasses reported molecular markers, with a promising area under the curve (AUC) of 0.95.",2159
37889268,Decreased prostate MRI cancer detection rate due to moderate to severe susceptibility artifacts from hip prosthesis.,European radiology,2024,"To evaluate the impact of susceptibility artifacts from hip prosthesis on cancer detection rate (CDR) in prostate MRI. This three-center retrospective study included prostate MRI studies for patients without known prostate cancer between 2017 and 2021. Exams with hip prosthesis were searched on MRI reports. The degree of susceptibility artifact on diffusion-weighted images was retrospectively categorized into mild, moderate, and severe (> 66%, 33-66%, and < 33% of the prostate volume are evaluable) by blind reviewers. CDR was defined as the number of exams with Gleason score ≥7 detected by MRI (PI-RADS ≥3) divided by the total number of exams. For each artifact grade, control exams without hip prosthesis were matched (1:6 match), and CDR was compared. The degree of CDR reduction was evaluated with ratio, and influential factors were evaluated by expanding the equation. Hip arthroplasty was present in 548 (4.8%) of the 11,319 MRI exams. CDR of the cases and matched control exams for each artifact grade were as follows: mild (n = 238), 0.27 vs 0.25, CDR ratio = 1.09 [95% CI: 0.87-1.37]; moderate (n = 143), 0.18 vs 0.27, CDR ratio = 0.67 [95% CI: 0.46-0.96]; severe (n = 167), 0.22 vs 0.28, CDR ratio = 0.80 [95% CI: 0.59-1.08]. When moderate and severe artifact grades were combined, CDR ratio was 0.74 [95% CI: 0.58-0.93]. CDR reduction was mostly attributed to the increased frequency of PI-RADS 1-2. With moderate to severe susceptibility artifacts from hip prosthesis, CDR was decreased to 74% compared to the matched control. Moderate to severe susceptibility artifacts from hip prosthesis may cause a non-negligible CDR reduction in prostate MRI. Expanding indications for systematic prostate biopsy may be considered when PI-RADS 1-2 was assigned. • We proposed cancer detection rate as a diagnostic performance metric in prostate MRI. • With moderate to severe susceptibility artifacts secondary to hip arthroplasty, cancer detection rate decreased to 74% compared to the matched control. • Expanding indications for systematic prostate biopsy may be considered when PI-RADS 1-2 is assigned.",2115

37882835,Nodal infiltration in endometrial cancer: a prediction model using best subset regression.,European radiology,2024,"To build preoperative prediction models with and without MRI for regional lymph node metastasis (r-LNM, pelvic and/or para-aortic LNM (PENM/PANM)) and for PANM in endometrial cancer using established risk factors. In this retrospective two-center study, 364 patients with endometrial cancer were included: 253 in the model development and 111 in the external validation. For r-LNM and PANM, respectively, best subset regression with ten-time fivefold cross validation was conducted using ten established risk factors (4 clinical and 6 imaging factors). Models with the top 10 percentile of area under the curve (AUC) and with the fewest variables in the model development were subjected to the external validation (11 and 4 candidates, respectively, for r-LNM and PANM). Then, the models with the highest AUC were selected as the final models. Models without MRI findings were developed similarly, assuming the cases where MRI was not available. The final r-LNM model consisted of pelvic lymph node (PEN) ≥ 6 mm, deep myometrial invasion (DMI) on MRI, CA125, para-aortic lymph node (PAN) ≥ 6 mm, and biopsy; PANM model consisted of DMI, PAN, PEN, and CA125 (in order of correlation coefficient β values). The AUCs were 0.85 (95%CI: 0.77-0.92) and 0.86 (0.75-0.94) for the external validation, respectively. The model without MRI for r-LNM and PANM showed AUC of 0.79 (0.68-0.89) and 0.87 (0.76-0.96), respectively. The prediction models created by best subset regression with cross validation showed high diagnostic performance for predicting LNM in endometrial cancer, which may avoid unnecessary lymphadenectomies. The prediction risks of lymph node metastasis (LNM) and para-aortic LNM can be easily obtained for all patients with endometrial cancer by inputting the conventional clinical information into our models. They help in the decision-making for optimal lymphadenectomy and personalized treatment. •Diagnostic performance of lymph node metastases (LNM) in endometrial cancer is low based on size criteria and can be improved by combining with other clinical information. •The optimized logistic regression model for regional LNM consists of lymph node ≥ 6 mm, deep myometrial invasion, cancer antigen-125, and biopsy, showing high diagnostic performance. •Our model predicts the preoperative risk of LNM, which may avoid unnecessary lymphadenectomies.",2363

37870625,Influence of CT dose reduction on AI-driven malignancy estimation of incidental pulmonary nodules.,European radiology,2024,"The purpose of this study was to determine the influence of dose reduction on a commercially available lung cancer prediction convolutional neuronal network (LCP-CNN). CT scans from a cohort provided by the local lung cancer center (n = 218) with confirmed pulmonary malignancies and their corresponding reduced dose simulations (25% and 5% dose) were subjected to the LCP-CNN. The resulting LCP scores (scale 1-10, increasing malignancy risk) and the proportion of correctly classified nodules were compared. The cohort was divided into a low-, medium-, and high-risk group based on the respective LCP scores; shifts between the groups were studied to evaluate the potential impact on nodule management. Two different malignancy risk score thresholds were analyzed: a higher threshold of ≥ 9 (""rule-in"" approach) and a lower threshold of > 4 (""rule-out"" approach). In total, 169 patients with 196 nodules could be included (mean age ± SD, 64.5 ± 9.2 year; 49% females). Mean LCP scores for original, 25% and 5% dose levels were 8.5 ± 1.7, 8.4 ± 1.7 (p > 0.05 vs. original dose) and 8.2 ± 1.9 (p < 0.05 vs. original dose), respectively. The proportion of correctly classified nodules with the ""rule-in"" approach decreased with simulated dose reduction from 58.2 to 56.1% (p = 0.34) and to 52.0% for the respective dose levels (p = 0.01). For the ""rule-out"" approach the respective values were 95.9%, 96.4%, and 94.4% (p = 0.12). When reducing the original dose to 25%/5%, eight/twenty-two nodules shifted to a lower, five/seven nodules to a higher malignancy risk group. CT dose reduction may affect the analyzed LCP-CNN regarding the classification of pulmonary malignancies and potentially alter pulmonary nodule management. Utilization of a ""rule-out"" approach with a lower malignancy risk threshold prevents underestimation of the nodule malignancy risk for the analyzed software, especially in high-risk cohorts. • LCP-CNN may be affected by CT image parameters such as noise resulting from low-dose CT acquisitions. • CT dose reduction can alter pulmonary nodule management recommendations by affecting the outcome of the LCP-CNN. • Utilization of a lower malignancy risk threshold prevents underestimation of pulmonary malignancies in high-risk cohorts.",2260
37870624,Prognostic MRI features to predict postresection survivals for very early to intermediate stage hepatocellular carcinoma.,European radiology,2024,"Contrast-enhanced MRI can provide individualized prognostic information for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We aimed to investigate the value of MRI features to predict early (≤ 2 years)/late (> 2 years) recurrence-free survival (E-RFS and L-RFS, respectively) and overall survival (OS). Consecutive adult patients at a tertiary academic center who received curative-intent liver resection for very early to intermediate stage HCC and underwent preoperative contrast-enhanced MRI were retrospectively enrolled from March 2011 to April 2021. Three masked radiologists independently assessed 54 MRI features. Uni- and multivariable Cox regression analyses were conducted to investigate the associations of imaging features with E-RFS, L-RFS, and OS. This study included 600 patients (median age, 53 years; 526 men). During a median follow-up of 55.3 months, 51% of patients experienced recurrence (early recurrence: 66%; late recurrence: 34%), and 17% died. Tumor size, multiple tumors, rim arterial phase hyperenhancement, iron sparing in solid mass, tumor growth pattern, and gastroesophageal varices were associated with E-RFS and OS (largest p = .02). Nonperipheral washout (p = .006), markedly low apparent diffusion coefficient value (p = .02), intratumoral arteries (p = .01), and width of the main portal vein (p = .03) were associated with E-RFS but not with L-RFS or OS, while the VICT2 trait was specifically associated with OS (p = .02). Multiple tumors (p = .048) and radiologically-evident cirrhosis (p < .001) were the only predictors for L-RFS. Twelve visually-assessed MRI features predicted postoperative E-RFS (≤ 2 years), L-RFS (> 2 years), and OS for very early to intermediate-stage HCCs. The prognostic MRI features may help inform personalized surgical planning, neoadjuvant/adjuvant therapies, and postoperative surveillance, thus may be included in future prognostic models. • Tumor size, multiple tumors, rim arterial phase hyperenhancement, iron sparing, tumor growth pattern, and gastroesophageal varices predicted both recurrence-free survival within 2 years and overall survival. • Nonperipheral washout, markedly low apparent diffusion coefficient value, intratumoral arteries, and width of the main portal vein specifically predicted recurrence-free survival within 2 years, while the VICT2 trait specifically predicted overall survival. • Multiple tumors and radiologically-evident cirrhosis were the only predictors for recurrence-free survival beyond 2 years.",2493

DL models were trained to simultaneously predict five morphological and histopathological features using preoperative chest CT scans from patients with resected lung adenocarcinomas. The DL score was validated in temporal and external test sets, with freedom from recurrence (FFR) and overall survival (OS) as outcomes. Discrimination was evaluated using the time-dependent area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (TD-AUC) and compared with the DL discrete-time survival model. Additionally, we performed multivariable Cox regression analysis. In the temporal test set (640 patients; median age, 64 years), the TD-AUC was 0.79 for 5-year FFR and 0.73 for 5-year OS. In the external test set (846 patients; median age, 65 years), the TD-AUC was 0.71 for 5-year OS, equivalent to the pathologic stage (0.71 vs. 0.71 [p = 0.74]). The prognostic value of the DL score was independent of clinical factors (adjusted per-percentage hazard ratio for FFR (temporal test), 1.02 [95% CI: 1.01-1.03; p < 0.001]; OS (temporal test), 1.01 [95% CI: 1.002-1.02; p = 0.01]; OS (external test), 1.01 [95% CI: 1.005-1.02; p < 0.001]). Our model showed a higher TD-AUC than the DL discrete-time survival model, but without statistical significance (2.5-year OS: 0.73 vs. 0.68; p = 0.13). The CT-based prognostic score from collective deep learning of morphological and histopathological features showed potential in predicting survival in lung adenocarcinomas. Collective CT-based deep learning of morphological and histopathological features presents potential for enhancing lung adenocarcinoma prognostication and optimizing pre-/postoperative management. • A CT-based prognostic model was developed using collective deep learning of morphological and histopathological features from preoperative CT scans of 3181 patients with resected lung adenocarcinoma. • The prognostic performance of the model was comparable-to-higher performance than the pathologic T category or stage. • Our approach yielded a higher discrimination performance than the direct survival prediction model, but without statistical significance (0.73 vs. 0.68; p=0.13).",2375
37857902,Routine radiology-pathology concordance evaluation of CT-guided percutaneous lung biopsies increases the number of cancers identified.,European radiology,2024,"Routine concordance evaluation between pathology and imaging findings was introduced for CT-guided biopsies. To analyze malignancy rate in concordant, discordant, and indeterminate non-malignant results of CT-guided lung biopsies. Concordance between pathology results and imaging findings of consecutive patients undergoing CT-guided lung biopsy between 7/1/2016 and 9/30/2021 was assessed during routine meetings by procedural radiologists. Concordant was defined as pathology consistent with imaging findings; discordant was used when pathology could not explain imaging findings; indeterminate when pathology could explain imaging findings but there was concern for malignancy. Recommendations for discordant and indeterminate were provided. All the malignant results were concordant. Pathology of repeated biopsy, surgical sample, or follow-up was considered reference standard. Consecutive 828 CT-guided lung biopsies were performed on 795 patients (median age 70 years, IQR 61-77), 423/828 (51%) women. On pathology, 224/828 (27%) were non-malignant. Among the non-malignant, radiology-pathology concordance determined 138/224 (62%) to be concordant with imaging findings, 54/224 (24%) discordant, and 32/224 (14%) indeterminate. When compared to the reference standard, 33/54 (61%) discordant results, 6/30 (20%) indeterminate, and 3/133 (2%) concordant were malignant. The prevalence of malignancy in the three groups was significantly different (p < 0.001). Time to diagnosis was significantly different between patients who reached the diagnosis with imaging follow-up (median 114 days, IQR 69-206) compared to repeat biopsy (33 days, IQR 18-133) (p = 0.01). Routine radiology-pathology concordance evaluation of CT-guided lung biopsy correctly identifies patients at high risk for missed diagnosis of malignancy. Repeat biopsy is the fastest method to reach diagnosis. A routine radiology-pathology concordance assessment identifies patients with non-malignant CT-guided lung biopsy result who are at greater risk of missed diagnosis of malignancy. • A routine radiology-pathology concordance evaluation of CT-guided lung biopsies classified 224 non-malignant results as concordant, discordant, or indeterminate. • The percentage of malignancy on follow-up was significantly different in concordant (2%), discordant (61%), and indeterminate (20%) (p < 0.001). • Time to definitive diagnosis was significantly shorter with repeat biopsy (33 days), compared to imaging follow-up (114 days), p = 0.01.",2510

37855688,PET/CT Biomarkers Enable Risk Stratification of Patients with Relapsed/Refractory Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma Enrolled in the LOTIS-2 Clinical Trial.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,2024,"Significant progress has occurred in developing quantitative PET/CT biomarkers in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Total metabolic tumor volume (MTV) is the most extensively studied, enabling assessment of FDG-avid tumor burden associated with outcomes. However, prior studies evaluated the outcome of cytotoxic chemotherapy or chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy without data on recently approved FDA agents. Therefore, we aimed to assess the prognosis of PET/CT biomarkers in patients treated with loncastuximab tesirine. We centrally reviewed screening PET/CT scans of patients with relapsed/refractory DLBCL enrolled in the LOTIS-2 (NCT03589469) study. MTV was obtained by computing individual volumes using the SUV ≥4.0 threshold. Other PET/CT metrics, clinical factors, and the International Metabolic Prognostic Index (IMPI) were evaluated. Logistic regression was used to assess the association between biomarkers and treatment response. Cox regression was used to determine the effect of biomarkers on time-to-event outcomes. We estimated biomarker prediction as continuous and binary variables defined by cutoff points. Across 138 patients included in this study, MTV with a cutoff point of 96 mL was the biomarker associated with the highest predictive performance in univariable and multivariable models to predict failure to achieve complete metabolic response (OR, 5.42; P = 0.002), progression-free survival (HR, 2.68; P = 0.002), and overall survival (HR, 3.09; P < 0.0001). IMPI demonstrated an appropriate performance, however, not better than MTV alone. Pretreatment MTV demonstrated robust risk stratification, with those patients demonstrating high MTV achieving lower responses and survival to loncastuximab tesirine in relapsed/refractory DLBCL.",1779
37853176,Predicting meningioma grades and pathologic marker expression via deep learning.,European radiology,2024,"To establish a deep learning (DL) model for predicting tumor grades and expression of pathologic markers of meningioma. A total of 1192 meningioma patients from two centers who underwent surgical resection between September 2018 and December 2021 were retrospectively included. The pathological data and post-contrast T1-weight images for each patient were collected. The patients from institute I were subdivided into training, validation, and testing sets, while the patients from institute II served as the external testing cohort. The fine-tuned ResNet50 model based on transfer learning was adopted to classify WHO grade in the whole cohort and predict Ki-67 index, H3K27me3, and progesterone receptor (PR) status of grade 1 meningiomas. The predictive performance was evaluated by the accuracy and loss curve, confusion matrix, receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC), and area under curve (AUC). The DL prediction model for each label achieved high predictive performance in two cohorts. For WHO grade prediction, the area under the curve (AUC) was 0.966 (95%CI 0.957-0.975) in the internal testing set and 0.669 (95%CI 0.643-0.695) in the external validation cohort. The AUC in predicting Ki-67 index, H3K27me3, and PR status were 0.905 (95%CI 0.895-0.915), 0.773 (95%CI 0.760-0.786), and 0.771 (95%CI 0.750-0.792) in the internal testing set and 0.591 (95%CI 0.562-0.620), 0.658 (95%CI 0.648-0.668), and 0.703 (95%CI 0.674-0.732) in the external validation cohort, respectively. DL models can preoperatively predict meningioma grades and pathologic marker expression with favorable predictive performance. Our DL model could predict meningioma grades and expression of pathologic markers and identify high-risk patients with WHO grade 1 meningioma, which would suggest a more aggressive operative intervention preoperatively and a more frequent follow-up schedule postoperatively. WHO grades and some pathologic markers of meningioma were associated with therapeutic strategies and clinical outcomes. A deep learning-based approach was employed to develop a model for predicting meningioma grades and the expression of pathologic markers. Preoperative prediction of meningioma grades and the expression of pathologic markers was beneficial for clinical decision-making.",2284

Based on the true diffusion coefficient (D MVI-positive HCC exhibited a significantly higher fraction of habitat 4 (f DWI-based habitat imaging shows clinical potential for noninvasively and preoperatively determining the MVI of HCC with high accuracy. The proposed strategy, diffusion-weighted imaging-based habitat imaging, can be applied for preoperatively and noninvasively identifying microvascular invasion in hepatocellular carcinoma, which offers potential benefits in terms of prognostic prediction and clinical management. • This study proposed a strategy of DWI-based habitat imaging for hepatocellular carcinoma. • The habitat imaging-derived metrics can serve as diagnostic markers for identifying the microvascular invasion. • Integrating the habitat-based metric and clinical variable, a predictive nomogram was constructed and displayed high accuracy for predicting microvascular invasion.",1286
37853174,Role of contrast-enhanced mammography in the preoperative detection of ductal carcinoma in situ of the breasts: a comparison with low-energy image and magnetic resonance imaging.,European radiology,2024,"To compare contrast-enhanced mammography (CEM) with low-energy image (LEI) alone and with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the preoperative diagnosis of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). In this single-center retrospective study, we reviewed 98 pure DCIS lesions in 96 patients who underwent CEM and MRI within 2 weeks preoperatively. The diagnostic performances of each imaging modality, lesion morphology, and extent were evaluated. The sensitivity of CEM to DCIS was similar to that of MRI (92.9% vs. 93.9%, p = 0.77) and was significantly higher than that of LEI alone (76.5%, p = 0.002). The sensitivity of CEM to calcified DCIS (92.4%) was not significantly different from LEI alone (92.4%) and from MRI (93.9%, p = 1.00). However, CEM contributed to the simultaneous comparison of calcifications with enhancements. CEM had considerably higher sensitivity compared with LEI alone (93.8% vs. 43.8%, p < 0.001) and performed similarly to MRI (93.8%, p = 1.00) for noncalcified DCIS. All DCIS lesions were enhanced in MRI, whereas 94.9% (93/98) were enhanced in CEM. Non-mass enhancement was the most common presentation (CEM 63.4% and MRI 66.3%). The difference between the lesion size on each imaging modality and the histopathological size was smallest in MRI, followed by CEM, and largest in LEI. CEM was more sensitive than LEI alone and comparable to MRI in DCIS diagnosis. The enhanced morphology of DCIS in CEM was consistent with that in MRI. CEM was superior to LEI alone in size measurement of DCIS. This study investigated the value of CEM in the diagnosis and evaluation of DCIS, aiming to offer a reference for the selection of examination methods for DCIS and contribute to the early diagnosis and precise treatment of DCIS. • DCIS is an important indication for breast surgery. Early and accurate diagnosis is crucial for DCIS treatment and prognosis. • CEM overcomes the deficiency of mammography in noncalcified DCIS diagnosis, exhibiting similar sensitivity to MRI; and CEM contributes to the comparison of calcification and enhancement of calcified DCIS, thereby outperforming MRI. • CEM is superior to LEI alone and slightly inferior to MRI in the size evaluation of DCIS.",2198

American journal of roentgenology,2024,"DWI is a noncontrast MRI technique that measures the diffusion of water molecules within biologic tissue. DWI is increasingly incorporated into routine breast MRI examinations. Currently, the main applications of DWI are breast cancer detection and characterization, prognostication, and prediction of treatment response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. In addition, DWI is promising as a noncontrast MRI alternative for breast cancer screening. Problems with suboptimal resolution and image quality have restricted the mainstream use of DWI for breast imaging, but these shortcomings are being addressed through several technologic advancements. In this review, we present an up-to-date assessment of the use of DWI for breast cancer imaging, including a summary of the clinical literature and recommendations for future use.",822
37848775,Proliferative hepatocellular carcinomas in cirrhosis: patient outcomes of LI-RADS category 4/5 and category M.,European radiology,2024,"We aimed to compare Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System (LI-RADS) category 4/5 and category M (LR-M) of proliferative hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) in cirrhotic patients and evaluate their impacts on prognosis. This retrospective multi-reader study included cirrhotic patients with single treatment-naïve HCC ≤ 5.0 cm who underwent contrast-enhanced CT, MRI, and subsequent hepatic resection within 2 months. The percentages of CT/MRI LR-4/5 and LR-M in proliferative and non-proliferative HCCs were compared. Univariable and multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were performed to assess the association of LI-RADS categories (LR-4/5 vs. LR-M) and pathologic classification (proliferative vs. non-proliferative) with overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS). Subgroups of patients with proliferative and non-proliferative HCCs were analyzed to compare OS and RFS between LR-4/5 and LR-M. Of the 204 included patients, 38 were classified as having proliferative HCC. The percentages of LR-M were higher in proliferative than non-proliferative HCC on both CT (15.8% vs. 3.0%, p = 0.007) and MRI (26.3% vs. 9.6%, p = 0.016). Independent of pathologic classification, CT and MRI LR-M were significantly associated with poorer OS (hazard ratio (HR) = 4.58, p = 0.013, and HR = 6.45, p < 0.001) and RFS (HR = 3.66, p = 0.005, and HR = 6.44, p < 0.001) than LR-4/5. MRI LR-M was associated with significantly poorer OS (p ≤ 0.003) and RFS (p < 0.001) than MRI LR-4/5 in both proliferative and non-proliferative HCCs. This multi-reader study showed that the percentages of LR-M were significantly higher in proliferative than non-proliferative HCCs. CT/MRI LR-M was significantly associated with poor OS and RFS, independent of the pathologic classification of proliferative versus non-proliferative HCCs. CT and MRI LI-RADS category M can be clinically useful in predicting poor outcomes in patients with proliferative and non-proliferative hepatocellular carcinomas. • The percentages of LR-M tumors on both CT and MRI were significantly higher in proliferative than non-proliferative hepatocellular carcinomas. • Independent of pathologic classification, CT/MRI LR-M categories were correlated with poor overall survival and recurrence-free survival. • Patients with both proliferative and non-proliferative hepatocellular carcinomas categorized as MRI LR-M had significantly poorer overall survival and recurrence-free survival than those categorized as MRI LR-4/5.",2506

This retrospective, multicenter study included consecutive patients with newly diagnosed and pathologically confirmed OPSCC between January 2017 and December 2020 (110 patients in the training set, 44 patients in the external validation set). A total of 293 radiomics features were extracted from three sequences (T2-weighted images [T2WI], contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images [CE-T1WI], and ADC). Combinations of three feature selection, five oversampling, and 12 machine learning techniques were evaluated to optimize its diagnostic performance. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of the top five models was validated in the external validation set. A total of 154 patients (59.2 ± 9.1 years; 132 men [85.7%]) were included, and oversampling was employed to account for data imbalance between HPV-positive and HPV-negative OPSCC (86.4% [133/154] vs. 13.6% [21/154]). For the ADC radiomics model, the combination of random oversampling and ridge showed the highest diagnostic performance in the external validation set (AUC, 0.791; 95% CI, 0.775-0.808). The ADC radiomics model showed a higher trend in diagnostic performance compared to the radiomics model using CE-T1WI (AUC, 0.604; 95% CI, 0.590-0.618), T2WI (AUC, 0.695; 95% CI, 0.673-0.717), and a combination of both (AUC, 0.642; 95% CI, 0.626-0.657). The ADC radiomics model using random oversampling and ridge showed the highest diagnostic performance in predicting the HPV status of OPSCC in the external validation set. Among multiple sequences, the ADC radiomics model has a potential for generalizability and applicability in clinical practice. Exploring multiple oversampling and machine learning techniques was a valuable strategy for optimizing radiomics model performance. • Previous radiomics studies using multiparametric MRI were conducted at single centers without external validation and had unresolved data imbalances. • Among the ADC, CE-T1WI, and T2WI radiomics models and the ADC histogram models, the ADC radiomics model was the best-performing model for predicting human papillomavirus status in oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma. • The ADC radiomics model with the combination of random oversampling and ridge showed the highest diagnostic performance.",2491

This retrospective single-institution study included patients with isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) wild-type glioblastoma and a newly developed or enlarging measurable contrast-enhancing mass within 12 weeks after concurrent chemoradiotherapy. CBV, capillary transit time heterogeneity (CTH), oxygen extraction fraction (OEF), and cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO A total of 103 patients were included (mean age, 59.6 years; 59 women), with 67 cases of TP and 36 cases of pseudoprogression. Pseudoprogression exhibited higher CTH (4.0 vs. 3.4, p = .019) and higher OEF (12.7 vs. 10.7, p = .014) than TP, but a similar CBV (1.48 vs. 1.53, p = .13) and CMRO High intratumoural capillary transit heterogeneity and high oxygen extraction fraction derived from DSC-PWI have enhanced the diagnostic value of CBV in pseudoprogression of post-treatment IDH-wild type glioblastoma. In the early post-treatment stage of glioblastoma, pseudoprogression exhibited both high oxygen extraction fraction and high capillary transit heterogeneity and these dynamic susceptibility contrast-perfusion weighted imaging derived parameters have added value in cerebral blood volume-based noninvasive differentiation of pseudoprogression from true progression. • Capillary transit time heterogeneity and oxygen extraction fraction can be measured noninvasively through processing of dynamic susceptibility contrast imaging. • Pseudoprogression exhibited higher capillary transit time heterogeneity and higher oxygen extraction fraction than true progression. • A combination of cerebral blood volume, capillary transit time heterogeneity, and oxygen extraction fraction yielded the highest diagnostic performance (area under the curve 0.71).",2011

37840101,MRI-detected tumor deposits in cT3 and cT4 rectal cancer following neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy.,European radiology,2024,"To evaluate the identification of tumor deposits (TDs) and the prognostic significance of an MRI tumor regression grade for TDs in patients with rectal cancer treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT). Ninety-one patients with cT3 or cT4 rectal cancer who underwent surgery following nCRT between August 2014 and June 2020 were retrospectively analyzed. Changes in pre-nCRT MRI-detected TDs (mrTDs) were described as mrTD regression grade. The diagnostic performance of post-nCRT MRI-detected TDs (ymrTDs) was compared with histopathological reference standard. The correlation between ymrTDs, mrTD regression grade, and disease-free survival (DFS) was assessed. The sensitivity and specificity of ymrTDs were 88.00% and 89.39%, respectively. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.887 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.803-0.944). The 3-year DFS of patients with positive ymrTDs was significantly lower than of the negative group (44.83% vs 82.73%, p < 0.001). The 3-year DFS was 33.33% for patients with poor regression of mrTDs following nCRT and 55.56% for those with moderate regression, compared to 69.23% in good responders and 83.97% in patients without mrTDs (p < 0.001). On multivariable Cox regression, mrTD regression grade was the only independent MRI factor associated with DFS (p = 0.042). Diagnostic performance of ymrTDs was moderate. The mrTD regression grade was independently correlated with DFS, which may have a prognostic implication for treatment and follow-up. Patients with poor regression of MRI-detected tumor deposits may benefit from more aggressive treatments, such as chemoradiation therapy plus induction or consolidation chemotherapy. • MRI provides a preoperative and noninvasive way to visualize tumor deposits (TDs) after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT). • Post-nCRT MRI-detected TDs are a poor prognostic marker in cT3 and cT4 rectal cancer patients. • The regression of MRI-detected TDs after nCRT is associated with an improved disease-free survival.",2028
37840100,Feasibility of UTE-MRI-based radiomics model for prediction of histopathologic subtype of lung adenocarcinoma: in comparison with CT-based radiomics model.,European radiology,2024,"To assess the feasibility of the UTE-MRI radiomic model in predicting the micropapillary and/or solid (MP/S) patterns of surgically resected lung adenocarcinoma. We prospectively enrolled 74 lesions from 71 patients who underwent UTE-MRI and CT before curative surgery for early lung adenocarcinoma. For conventional radiologic analysis, we analyzed the longest lesion diameter and lesion characteristics at both UTE-MRI and CT. Radiomic features were extracted from the volume of interest of the lesions and Rad-scores were generated using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator with fivefold cross-validation. Six models were constructed by combining the conventional radiologic model, UTE-MRI Rad-score, and CT Rad-score. The areas under the curves (AUCs) of each model were compared using the DeLong method. Early recurrence after curative surgery was analyzed, and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was performed. Twenty-four lesions were MP/S-positive, and 50 were MP/S-negative. The longitudinal size showed a small systematic difference between UTE-MRI and CT, with fair intermodality agreement of lesion characteristic (kappa = 0.535). The Rad-scores of the UTE-MRI and CT demonstrated AUCs of 0.84 and 0.841, respectively (p = 0.98). Among the six models, mixed conventional, UTE-MRI, and CT Rad-score model showed the highest diagnostic performance (AUC = 0.879). In the survival analysis, the high- and low-risk groups were successfully divided by the Rad-score in UTE-MRI (p = 0.01) and CT (p < 0.01). UTE-MRI radiomic model predicting MP/S positivity is feasible compared with the CT radiomic model. Also, it was associated with early recurrence in the survival analysis. A radiomic model utilizing UTE-MRI, which does not present a radiation hazard, was able to successfully predict the histopathologic subtype of lung adenocarcinoma, and it was associated with the patient's recurrence-free survival. • No studies have reported the ultrashort echo time (UTE)-MRI-based radiomic model for lung adenocarcinoma. • The UTE-MRI Rad-score showed comparable diagnostic performance with CT Rad-score for predicting micropapillary and/or solid histopathologic pattern. • UTE-MRI is feasible not only for conventional radiologic analysis, but also for radiomics analysis.",2287
37840099,A bimodal nomogram as an adjunct tool to reduce unnecessary breast biopsy following discordant ultrasonic and mammographic BI-RADS assessment.,European radiology,2024,"To develop a bimodal nomogram to reduce unnecessary biopsies in breast lesions with discordant ultrasound (US) and mammography (MG) Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) assessments. This retrospective study enrolled 706 women following opportunistic screening or diagnosis with discordant US and MG BI-RADS assessments (where one assessed a lesion as BI-RADS 4 or 5, while the other assessed the same lesion as BI-RADS 0, 2, or 3) from two medical centres between June 2019 and June 2021. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to develop the nomogram. DeLong's and McNemar's tests were used to assess the model's performance. Age, MG features (margin, shape, and density in masses, suspicious calcifications, and architectural distortion), and US features (margin and shape in masses as well as calcifications) were independent risk factors for breast cancer. The nomogram obtained an area under the curve of 0.87 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.83-0.91), 0.91 (95% CI, 0.87 - 0.96), and 0.92 (95% CI, 0.86-0.98) in the training, internal validation, and external testing samples, respectively, and demonstrated consistency in calibration curves. Coupling the nomogram with US reduced unnecessary biopsies from 74 to 44% and the missed malignancies rate from 13 to 2%. Similarly, coupling with MG reduced missed malignancies from 20 to 6%, and 63% of patients avoided unnecessary biopsies. Interobserver agreement between US and MG increased from - 0.708 (poor agreement) to 0.700 (substantial agreement) with the nomogram. When US and MG BI-RADS assessments are discordant, incorporating the nomogram may improve the diagnostic accuracy, avoid unnecessary breast biopsies, and minimise missed diagnoses. The nomogram developed in this study could be used as a computer program to assist radiologists with detecting breast cancer and ensuring more precise management and improved treatment decisions for breast lesions with discordant assessments in clinical practice. • Coupling the nomogram with US and mammography improves the detection of breast cancers without the risk of unnecessary biopsy or missed malignancies. • The nomogram increases mammography and US interobserver agreement and enhances the consistency of decision-making. • The nomogram has the potential to be a computer program to assist radiologists in identifying breast cancer and making optimal decisions.",2423
37823922,MRI-derived extracellular volume as a biomarker of cancer therapy cardiotoxicity: systematic review and meta-analysis.,European radiology,2024,"MRI-derived extracellular volume (ECV) allows characterization of myocardial changes before the onset of overt pathology, which may be caused by cancer therapy cardiotoxicity. Our purpose was to review studies exploring the role of MRI-derived ECV as an early cardiotoxicity biomarker to guide timely intervention. In April 2022, we performed a systematic search on EMBASE and PubMed for articles on MRI-derived ECV as a biomarker of cancer therapy cardiotoxicity. Two blinded researchers screened the retrieved articles, including those reporting ECV values at least 3 months from cardiotoxic treatment. Data extraction was performed for each article, including clinical and technical data, and ECV values. Pooled ECV was calculated using the random effects model and compared among different treatment regimens and among those who did or did not experience overt cardiac dysfunction. Meta-regression analyses were conducted to appraise which clinical or technical variables yielded a significant impact on ECV. Overall, 19 studies were included. Study populations ranged from 9 to 236 patients, for a total of 1123 individuals, with an average age ranging from 12.5 to 74 years. Most studies included patients with breast or esophageal cancer, treated with anthracyclines and chest radiotherapy. Pooled ECV was 28.44% (95% confidence interval, CI, 26.85-30.03%) among subjects who had undergone cardiotoxic cancer therapy, versus 25.23% (95%CI 23.31-27.14%) among those who had not (p = .003). A higher ECV in patients who underwent cardiotoxic treatment could imply subclinical changes in the myocardium, present even before overt cardiac pathology is detectable. The ability to detect subclinical changes in the myocardium displayed by ECV suggests its use as an early biomarker of cancer therapy-related cardiotoxicity. • Cardiotoxicity is a common adverse effect of cancer therapy; therefore, its prompt detection could improve patient outcomes. • Pooled MRI-derived myocardial extracellular volume was higher in patients who underwent cardiotoxic cancer therapy than in those who did not (28.44% versus 25.23%, p = .003). • MRI-derived myocardial extracellular volume represents a potential early biomarker of cancer therapy cardiotoxicity.",2247
37819276,Deep learning to assist composition classification and thyroid solid nodule diagnosis: a multicenter diagnostic study.,European radiology,2024,"This study aimed to propose a deep learning (DL)-based framework for identifying the composition of thyroid nodules and assessing their malignancy risk. We conducted a retrospective multicenter study using ultrasound images from four hospitals. Convolutional neural network (CNN) models were constructed to classify ultrasound images of thyroid nodules into solid and non-solid, as well as benign and malignant. A total of 11,201 images of 6784 nodules were used for training, validation, and testing. The area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC) was employed as the primary evaluation index. The models had AUCs higher than 0.91 in the benign and malignant grading of solid thyroid nodules, with the Inception-ResNet AUC being the highest at 0.94. In the test set, the best algorithm for identifying benign and malignant thyroid nodules had a sensitivity of 0.88, and a specificity of 0.86. In the human vs. DL test set, the best algorithm had a sensitivity of 0.93, and a specificity of 0.86. The Inception-ResNet model performed better than the senior physicians (p < 0.001). The sensitivity and specificity of the optimal model based on the external test set were 0.90 and 0.75, respectively. This research demonstrates that CNNs can assist thyroid nodule diagnosis and reduce the rate of unnecessary fine-needle aspiration (FNA). High-resolution ultrasound has led to increased detection of thyroid nodules. This results in unnecessary fine-needle aspiration and anxiety for patients whose nodules are benign. Deep learning can solve these problems to some extent. • Thyroid solid nodules have a high probability of malignancy. • Our models can improve the differentiation between benign and malignant solid thyroid nodules. • The differential performance of one model was superior to that of senior radiologists. Applying this could reduce the rate of unnecessary fine-needle aspiration of solid thyroid nodules.",1938
37816923,Fat-containing hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with cirrhosis: proposal of a diagnostic modification regarding enhancement characteristics.,European radiology,2024,"The aim of this study was to develop and validate an algorithm for the non-invasive diagnosis of these fat-containing HCCs. Eighty-four cirrhotic patients with 77 fat-containing HCCs and 11 non-HCC fat-containing nodules were retrospectively included. All MRIs were reviewed; nodule characteristics, European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) and LI-RADS classifications, and survival were collected. One of the major features of LI-RADS v2018 (non-rim-like arterial phase hyperenhancement [APHE]) was changed to include different enhancing patterns at arterial phase and a new fat-LI-RADS algorithm was created for fat-containing nodules in cirrhosis. Its diagnostic performance was evaluated in both a derivation and external validation cohort (external cohort including 58 fat-containing HCCs and 10 non-HCC fat nodules). Reproducibility of this new algorithm was assessed. In the derivation cohort, 54/77 (70.1%) fat-containing HCCs had APHE, 62/77 (80.5%) had enhancement compared to the nodule itself at arterial phase (APE), 43/77 (55.8%) had washout, and 20/77 (26.0%) had an enhancing capsule. EASL and LI-RADS had a sensitivity of 37.7% (29/77) and 36.4% (28/77), respectively, for the diagnosis of fat-containing HCC and both had a specificity of 100% (11/11). The new fat-LI-RADS algorithm increased sensitivity to 50.6% (39/77) without decreasing the specificity of 100% (11/11). The validation cohort confirmed the increased sensitivity, with a slight decrease in specificity. The concordance for the diagnosis of HCC for fat-LR5 was 85.3% (58/68). The new fat-LI-RADS algorithm proposed here significantly improves the performance of the non-invasive diagnosis of fat-containing HCC and thus could reduce the number of biopsies conducted for fat-containing HCCs. The European Association for the Study of the Liver and LI-RADS guidelines are poorly sensitive for the diagnosis of fat-containing HCC, mainly because of the low rate of arterial phase hyperenhancement (APHE) displayed by fat-containing HCC. Using all types of enhancement instead of APHE improves sensitivity of LI-RADS. • Fat-containing HCCs on MRI account for 7.5% of HCCs and have different imaging characteristics from non-fatty HCCs. • The European Association for the Study of the Liver and LI-RADS algorithms for the non-invasive diagnosis of HCC have low sensitivity for the diagnosis of fat-containing HCC with MRI (37.7% and 36.4%, respectively). • The new fat-LI-RADS, which includes a slight modification of the ""arterial enhancement"" criterion, improves the sensitivity for the diagnosis of fat-containing HCC using MRI, without degrading the specificity.",2660
37815447,Expanding Role of Advanced Image Analysis in CT-detected Indeterminate Pulmonary Nodules and Early Lung Cancer Characterization.,Radiology,2023,"The implementation of low-dose chest CT for lung screening presents a crucial opportunity to advance lung cancer care through early detection and interception. In addition, millions of pulmonary nodules are incidentally detected annually in the United States, increasing the opportunity for early lung cancer diagnosis. Yet, realization of the full potential of these opportunities is dependent on the ability to accurately analyze image data for purposes of nodule classification and early lung cancer characterization. This review presents an overview of traditional image analysis approaches in chest CT using semantic characterization as well as more recent advances in the technology and application of machine learning models using CT-derived radiomic features and deep learning architectures to characterize lung nodules and early cancers. Methodological challenges currently faced in translating these decision aids to clinical practice, as well as the technical obstacles of heterogeneous imaging parameters, optimal feature selection, choice of model, and the need for well-annotated image data sets for the purposes of training and validation, will be reviewed, with a view toward the ultimate incorporation of these potentially powerful decision aids into routine clinical practice.",1294
37812297,Multitask deep learning on mammography to predict extensive intraductal component in invasive breast cancer.,European radiology,2024,"To develop a multitask deep learning (DL) algorithm to automatically classify mammography imaging findings and predict the existence of extensive intraductal component (EIC) in invasive breast cancer. Mammograms with invasive breast cancers from 2010 to 2019 were downloaded for two radiologists performing image segmentation and imaging findings annotation. Images were randomly split into training, validation, and test datasets. A multitask approach was performed on the EfficientNet-B0 neural network mainly to predict EIC and classify imaging findings. Three more models were trained for comparison, including a single-task model (predicting EIC), a two-task model (predicting EIC and cell receptor status), and a three-task model (combining the abovementioned tasks). Additionally, these models were trained in a subgroup of invasive ductal carcinoma. The DeLong test was used to examine the difference in model performance. This study enrolled 1459 breast cancers on 3076 images. The EIC-positive rate was 29.0%. The three-task model was the best DL model with an area under the curve (AUC) of EIC prediction of 0.758 and 0.775 at the image and breast (patient) levels, respectively. Mass was the most accurately classified imaging finding (AUC = 0.915), followed by calcifications and mass with calcifications (AUC = 0.878 and 0.824, respectively). Cell receptor status prediction was less accurate (AUC = 0.625-0.653). The multitask approach improves the model training compared to the single-task model, but without significant effects. A mammography-based multitask DL model can perform simultaneous imaging finding classification and EIC prediction. The study results demonstrated the potential of deep learning to extract more information from mammography for clinical decision-making. • Extensive intraductal component (EIC) is an independent risk factor of local tumor recurrence after breast-conserving surgery. • A mammography-based deep learning model was trained to predict extensive intraductal component close to radiologists' reading. • The developed multitask deep learning model could perform simultaneous imaging finding classification and extensive intraductal component prediction.",2208
37812296,Multi-parametric MRI-based machine learning model for prediction of WHO grading in patients with meningiomas.,European radiology,2024,"The purpose of this study was to develop and validate a nomogram combined multiparametric MRI and clinical indicators for identifying the WHO grade of meningioma. Five hundred and sixty-eight patients were included in this study, who were diagnosed pathologically as having meningiomas. Firstly, radiomics features were extracted from CE-T1, T2, and 1-cm-thick tumor-to-brain interface (BTI) images. Then, difference analysis and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator were orderly used to select the most representative features. Next, the support vector machine algorithm was conducted to predict the WHO grade of meningioma. Furthermore, a nomogram incorporated radiomics features and valuable clinical indicators was constructed by logistic regression. The performance of the nomogram was assessed by calibration and clinical effectiveness, as well as internal validation. Peritumoral edema volume and gender are independent risk factors for predicting meningioma grade. The multiparametric MRI features incorporating CE-T1, T2, and BTI features showed the higher performance for prediction of meningioma grade with a pooled AUC = 0.885 (95% CI, 0.821-0.946) and 0.860 (95% CI, 0.788-0.923) in the training and test groups, respectively. Then, a nomogram with a pooled AUC = 0.912 (95% CI, 0.876-0.961), combined radiomics score, peritumoral edema volume, and gender improved diagnostic performance compared to radiomics model or clinical model and showed good calibration as the true results. Moreover, decision curve analysis demonstrated satisfactory clinical effectiveness of the proposed nomogram. A novel nomogram is simple yet effective in differentiating WHO grades of meningioma and thus can be used in patients with meningiomas. We proposed a nomogram that included clinical indicators and multi-parameter radiomics features, which can accurately, objectively, and non-invasively differentiate WHO grading of meningioma and thus can be used in clinical work. • The study combined radiomics features and clinical indicators for objectively predicting the meningioma grade. • The model with CE-T1 + T2 + brain-to-tumor interface features demonstrated the best predictive performance by investigating seven different radiomics models. • The nomogram potentially has clinical applications in distinguishing high-grade and low-grade meningiomas.",2367
37812294,The prognostic value of bone marrow retention index and bone marrow-to-liver ratio of baseline 18F-FDG PET/CT in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.,European radiology,2024,"To determine prognostic value of bone marrow retention index (RI-bm) and bone marrow-to-liver ratio (BLR) measured on baseline dual-phase  This prospective study enrolled 135 patients with newly diagnosed DLBCL. All patients underwent dual-phase  The final analysis included 98 patients with complete remission. At a median follow-up of 22 months, 57 patients showed no relapse, 74 survived, and 24 died. The 2-year relapse-free survival (RFS) values for patients with higher and lower RI-bm were 20% and 65.1%, respectively (p < 0.001), and for patients with higher and lower BLR were 30.2% and 69.6%, respectively (p < 0.001). The 2-year overall survival (OS) values for patients with higher and lower RI-bm were 60% and 76.3%, respectively (p = 0.023), and for patients with higher and lower BLR were 57.3% and 78.6%, respectively (p = 0.035). Univariate analysis revealed that RI-bm and BLR were independent significant prognostic factors for both RFS and OS (hazard ratio [HR] = 4.02, p < 0.001, and HR = 3.23, p < 0.001, respectively) and (HR = 2.83, p = 0.030 and HR = 2.38, p = 0.041, respectively). Baseline RI-bm and BLR were strong independent prognostic factors in DLBCL patients. Bone marrow retention index (RI-bm) and bone marrow-to-liver ratio (BLR) could represent suitable and noninvasive positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) parameters for predicting pretreatment risk in patients with newly diagnosed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) who were treated with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (R-CHOP) chemotherapy. • Bone marrow retention index (RI-bm) and bone marrow-to-liver ratio (BLR) are powerful prognostic variables in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) patients. • High BLR and RI-bm are significantly associated with poor overall survival (OS) and relapse-free survival (RFS). • RI-bm and BLR represent suitable and noninvasive risk indicators in DLBCL patients.",1955
37803212,Increased confidence of radiomics facilitating pretherapeutic differentiation of BRAF-altered pediatric low-grade glioma.,European radiology,2024,"Currently, the BRAF status of pediatric low-grade glioma (pLGG) patients is determined through a biopsy. We established a nomogram to predict BRAF status non-invasively using clinical and radiomic factors. Additionally, we assessed an advanced thresholding method to provide only high-confidence predictions for the molecular subtype. Finally, we tested whether radiomic features provide additional predictive information for this classification task, beyond that which is embedded in the location of the tumor. Random forest (RF) models were trained on radiomic and clinical features both separately and together, to evaluate the utility of each feature set. Instead of using the traditional single threshold technique to convert the model outputs to class predictions, we implemented a double threshold mechanism that accounted for uncertainty. Additionally, a linear model was trained and depicted graphically as a nomogram. The combined RF (AUC: 0.925) outperformed the RFs trained on radiomic (AUC: 0.863) or clinical (AUC: 0.889) features alone. The linear model had a comparable AUC (0.916), despite its lower complexity. Traditional thresholding produced an accuracy of 84.5%, while the double threshold approach yielded 92.2% accuracy on the 80.7% of patients with the highest confidence predictions. Models that included radiomic features outperformed, underscoring their importance for the prediction of BRAF status. A linear model performed similarly to RF but with the added benefit that it can be visualized as a nomogram, improving the explainability of the model. The double threshold technique was able to identify uncertain predictions, enhancing the clinical utility of the model. Radiomic features and tumor location are both predictive of BRAF status in pLGG patients. We show that they contain complementary information and depict the optimal model as a nomogram, which can be used as a non-invasive alternative to biopsy. • Radiomic features provide additional predictive information for the determination of the molecular subtype of pediatric low-grade gliomas patients, beyond what is embedded in the location of the tumor, which has an established relationship with genetic status. • An advanced thresholding method can help to distinguish cases where machine learning models have a high chance of being (in)correct, improving the utility of these models. • A simple linear model performs similarly to a more powerful random forest model at classifying the molecular subtype of pediatric low-grade gliomas but has the added benefit that it can be converted into a nomogram, which may facilitate clinical implementation by improving the explainability of the model.",2690

The combination of US and MB has been demonstrated to prolong the survival of patients with pancreatic cancer. This phase 2 clinical trial aimed to determine the clinical efficacy and safety of sonochemotherapy for inoperable pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma by using US and MB. Eighty-two patients with stage III or IV pancreatic cancer were recruited from July 2018 to March 2021 and followed up until September 2022. US treatment was performed with a modified diagnostic US scanner for 30 min after chemotherapeutic infusion. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS), and the secondary endpoints were Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) status < 2, progression-free survival (PFS), disease control rate (DCR), and adverse events. Seventy-eight patients were randomly allocated (40 to chemotherapy and 38 to sonochemotherapy). The median OS was longer with sonochemotherapy than with chemotherapy (9.10 vs. 6.10 months; p = 0.037). The median PFS with sonochemotherapy was 5.50 months, compared with 3.50 months (p = 0.080) for chemotherapy. The time of ECOG status < 2 was longer with sonochemotherapy (7.20 months) than with chemotherapy (5.00 months; p = 0.029). The DCR was 73.68% for sonochemotherapy compared with 42.50% for the control (p = 0.005). The incidence of overall adverse events was balanced between the two groups. The use of sonochemotherapy can extend the survival and well-being time of stage III or IV pancreatic cancer patients without any increase in serious adverse events. ChineseClinicalTrials.gov ChiCTR2100044721 CLINICAL RELEVANCE STATEMENT: This multicentre, randomised, controlled trial has proven that sonochemotherapy, namely, the combination of diagnostic ultrasound, microbubbles, and chemotherapy, could extend the overall survival of patients with end-stage pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma from 6.10 to 9.10 months without increasing any serious adverse events. • This is the first multicentre, randomised, controlled trial of sonochemotherapy for clinical pancreatic cancer treatment using ultrasound and a commercial ultrasound contrast agent. • Sonochemotherapy extended the median overall survival from 6.10 (chemotherapy alone) to 9.10 months. • The disease control rate increased from 42.50% with chemotherapy to 73.68% with sonochemotherapy.",2458
37792079,Diagnostic algorithm for subcentimeter hepatocellular carcinoma using alpha-fetoprotein and imaging features on gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI.,European radiology,2024,"To investigate the role of serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) in diagnosing subcentimeter hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) on gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI (EOB-MRI). This study retrospectively enrolled treatment-naïve patients with chronic hepatitis B who had a solitary subcentimeter observation on EOB-MRI from January 2017 to March 2023. Final diagnosis was confirmed by pathology for HCC and pathology or follow-up for benign controls. The AFP cutoff value for HCC was determined using Youden's index. Diagnostic criteria were developed according to significant findings in logistic regression analyses based on AFP and imaging features. The diagnostic performance of possible criteria was compared to the diagnostic hallmarks of HCC (arterial-phase hyperintensity and portal-phase hypointensity). A total of 305 patients (mean age, 51.5 ± 10.7 years; 153 men) were divided into derivation and temporal validation cohorts. Four findings, namely AFP >13.7 ng/mL, arterial-phase hyperintensity, portal-phase hypointensity, and transitional-phase hypointensity, were predictors of HCC. A new criterion (at least three of the four findings) showed higher sensitivity than the diagnostic hallmarks (derivation cohort, 71.6% vs. 52.3%, p < 0.001; validation cohort, 75.0% vs. 47.5%, p = 0.003) without decreasing specificity (derivation cohort, 92.5% vs. 92.5%, p > 0.999; validation cohort, 92.0% vs. 92.0%, p > 0.999). Another criterion (all four findings) achieved a slightly higher specificity than the diagnostic hallmark (derivation cohort, 99.1% vs. 92.5%, p = 0.023; validation cohort, 100.0% vs. 92.0%, p = 0.134). Subgroup analysis for hepatobiliary hypointense observations yielded similar results. Including AFP in the diagnostic algorithm may improve the diagnostic performance for subcentimeter HCC. Combining imaging features on gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI with alpha-fetoprotein may enhance the diagnostic performance for subcentimeter HCC in treatment-naïve patients with chronic hepatitis B. • The traditional diagnostic hallmark of HCC (arterial-phase hyperintensity and portal-phase hypointensity) shows modest diagnostic performance for subcentimeter HCC on EOB-MRI. • Serum alpha-fetoprotein > 13.7 ng/mL, arterial-phase hyperintensity, portal-phase hypointensity, and transitional-phase hypointensity were independent predictors for subcentimeter HCC. • A criterion of at least three of the four above findings achieved a higher sensitivity without decreasing specificity.",2485
37782338,Radiomics in cone-beam breast CT for the prediction of axillary lymph node metastasis in breast cancer: a multi-center multi-device study.,European radiology,2024,"To develop a radiomics model in contrast-enhanced cone-beam breast CT (CE-CBBCT) for preoperative prediction of axillary lymph node (ALN) status and metastatic burden of breast cancer. Two hundred and seventy-four patients who underwent CE-CBBCT examination with two scanners between 2012 and 2021 from two institutions were enrolled. The primary tumor was annotated in each patient image, from which 1781 radiomics features were extracted with PyRadiomics. After feature selection, support vector machine models were developed to predict ALN status and metastatic burden. To avoid overfitting on a specific patient subset, 100 randomly stratified splits were made to assign the patients to either training/fine-tuning or test set. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of these radiomics models was compared to those obtained when training the models only with clinical features and combined clinical-radiomics descriptors. Ground truth was established by histopathology. One hundred and eighteen patients had ALN metastasis (N + (≥ 1)). Of these, 74 had low burden (N + (1~2)) and 44 high burden (N + (≥ 3)). The remaining 156 patients had none (N0). AUC values across the 100 test repeats in predicting ALN status (N0/N + (≥ 1)) were 0.75 ± 0.05 (0.67~0.93, radiomics model), 0.68 ± 0.07 (0.53~0.85, clinical model), and 0.74 ± 0.05 (0.67~0.88, combined model). For metastatic burden prediction (N + (1~2)/N + (≥ 3)), AUC values were 0.65 ± 0.10 (0.50~0.88, radiomics model), 0.55 ± 0.10 (0.40~0.80, clinical model), and 0.64 ± 0.09 (0.50~0.90, combined model), with all the ranges spanning 0.5. In both cases, the radiomics model was significantly better than the clinical model (both p < 0.01) and comparable with the combined model (p = 0.56 and 0.64). Radiomics features of primary tumors could have potential in predicting ALN metastasis in CE-CBBCT imaging. The findings support potential clinical use of radiomics for predicting axillary lymph node metastasis in breast cancer patients and addressing the limited axilla coverage of cone-beam breast CT. • Contrast-enhanced cone-beam breast CT-based radiomics could have potential to predict N0 vs. N + (≥ 1) and, to a limited extent, N + (1~2) vs. N + (≥ 3) from primary tumor, and this could help address the limited axilla coverage, pending future verifications on larger cohorts. • The average AUC of radiomics and combined models was significantly higher than that of clinical models but showed no significant difference between themselves. • Radiomics features descriptive of tumor texture were found informative on axillary lymph node status, highlighting a higher heterogeneity for tumor with positive axillary lymph node.",2712
37776361,Evaluation of simultaneous multi-slice acquisition with advanced processing for free-breathing diffusion-weighted imaging in patients with liver metastasis.,European radiology,2024,"Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) with simultaneous multi-slice (SMS) acquisition and advanced processing can accelerate acquisition time and improve MR image quality. This study evaluated the image quality and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) measurements of free-breathing DWI acquired from patients with liver metastases using a prototype SMS-DWI acquisition (with/without an advanced processing option) and conventional DWI. Four DWI schemes were compared in a pilot 5-patient cohort; three DWI schemes were further assessed in a 24-patient cohort. Two readers scored image quality of all b-value images and ADC maps across the three methods. ADC measurements were performed, for all three methods, in left and right liver parenchyma, spleen, and liver metastases. The Friedman non-parametric test (post-hoc Wilcoxon test with Bonferroni correction) was used to compare image quality scoring; t-test was used for ADC comparisons. SMS-DWI was faster (by 24%) than conventional DWI. Both readers scored the SMS-DWI with advanced processing as having the best image quality for highest b-value images (b750) and ADC maps; Cohen's kappa inter-reader agreement was 0.6 for b750 image and 0.56 for ADC maps. The prototype SMS-DWI sequence with advanced processing allowed a better visualization of the left lobe of the liver. ADC measured in liver parenchyma, spleen, and liver metastases using the SMS-DWI with advanced processing option showed lower values than those derived from the SMS-DWI method alone (t-test, p < 0.0001; p < 0.0001; p = 0.002). Free-breathing SMS-DWI with advanced processing was faster and demonstrated better image quality versus a conventional DWI protocol in liver patients. Free-breathing simultaneous multi-slice- diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) with advanced processing was faster and demonstrated better image quality versus a conventional DWI protocol in liver patients. • Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) with simultaneous multi-slice (SMS) can accelerate acquisition time and improve image quality. • Apparent diffusion coefficients (ADC) measured in liver parenchyma, spleen, and liver metastases using the simultaneous multi-slice DWI with advanced processing were significantly lower than those derived from the simultaneous multi-slice DWI method alone. • Simultaneous multi-slice DWI sequence with inline advanced processing was faster and demonstrated better image quality in liver patients.",2435
37775590,Can absolute arterial phase hyperenhancement improve sensitivity of detection of hepatocellular carcinoma in indeterminate nodules on CT?,European radiology,2024,"To determine if quantitative assessment of relative (R) and absolute (A) arterial phase hyperenhancement (APHE) and washout (WO) applied to indeterminate nodules on CT would improve the overall sensitivity of detection of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). One-hundred and fourteen patients (90 male; mean age, 65 years) with 210 treatment-naïve HCC nodules (190 HCCs, 20 benign) who underwent 4-phase CT were included in this retrospective study. Four radiologists independently assigned a qualitative LR (LI-RADS) category per nodule. LR-3/4 nodules were then quantitatively analyzed by the 4 readers, placing ROIs within nodules and adjacent liver parenchyma. A/R-APHE and WO were calculated, and per-reader sensitivity and specificity updated. Interobserver agreement and AUCs were calculated per reader. Qualitative readers 1-4 categorized 57, 69, 57, and 63 nodules as LR-3/4 respectively with moderate to substantial agreement in LR category (kappa 0.56-0.69, p < 0.0001); their diagnostic performances in the detection of HCC were 80%, 73.2%, 77.4%, and 77.4% sensitivity, and 100%, 95%, 70%, and 100% specificity, respectively. A threshold of ≥ 20 HU for A-APHE increased overall sensitivity of HCC detection by 0.5-3.1% without changing specificity for the subset of nodules APHE - /WO + on qualitative read, with 2, 6, 6, and 1 additional HCC detected by readers 1-4. Relative and various A-WO formulae and thresholds all increased sensitivity, but with a drop in specificity for some/all readers. Quantitatively assessed A-APHE showed potential to increase sensitivity and maintain specificity of HCC diagnosis when selectively applied to indeterminate nodules demonstrating WO without subjective APHE. Quantitatively assessed R and A-WO increased sensitivity, however reduced specificity. A workflow using selective quantification of absolute arterial enhancement is routinely employed in the CT assessment of renal and adrenal nodules. Quantitatively assessed absolute arterial enhancement is a simple tool which may be used as an adjunct to help increase sensitivity and maintain specificity of HCC diagnosis in indeterminate nodules demonstrating WO without subjective APHE. • In indeterminate nodules categorized as LI-RADS 3/4 due to absent subjective arterial phase hyperenhancement, a cut-off for absolute arterial phase hyperenhancement of ≥ 20 HU may increase the overall sensitivity of detection of HCC by 0.5-3.1% without affecting specificity. • Relative and various absolute washout formulae and cut-offs increased sensitivity of HCC detection, but with a drop in specificity for some/all readers.",2620
37774317,RANO 2.0: Update to the Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology Criteria for High- and Low-Grade Gliomas in Adults.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,2023,"The Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) criteria for high-grade gliomas (RANO-HGG) and low-grade gliomas (RANO-LGG) were developed to improve reliability of response assessment in glioma trials. Over time, some limitations of these criteria were identified, and challenges emerged regarding integrating features of the modified RANO (mRANO) or the immunotherapy RANO (iRANO) criteria. Informed by data from studies evaluating the different criteria, updates to the RANO criteria are proposed (RANO 2.0). We recommend a standard set of criteria for both high- and low-grade gliomas, to be used for all trials regardless of the treatment modalities being evaluated. In the newly diagnosed setting, the postradiotherapy magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), rather than the postsurgical MRI, will be used as the baseline for comparison with subsequent scans. Since the incidence of pseudoprogression is high in the 12 weeks after radiotherapy, continuation of treatment and confirmation of progression during this period with a repeat MRI, or histopathologic evidence of unequivocal recurrent tumor, are required to define tumor progression. However, confirmation scans are not mandatory after this period nor for the evaluation of treatment for recurrent tumors. For treatments with a high likelihood of pseudoprogression, mandatory confirmation of progression with a repeat MRI is highly recommended. The primary measurement remains the maximum cross-sectional area of tumor (two-dimensional) but volumetric measurements are an option. For IDH wild-type glioblastoma, the nonenhancing disease will no longer be evaluated except when assessing response to antiangiogenic agents. In IDH-mutated tumors with a significant nonenhancing component, clinical trials may require evaluating both the enhancing and nonenhancing tumor components for response assessment. The revised RANO 2.0 criteria refine response assessment in gliomas.",1932
37773633,Magnetic Resonance Imaging of Iron Metabolism with T2* Mapping Predicts an Enhanced Clinical Response to Pharmacologic Ascorbate in Patients with GBM.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,2024,"Pharmacologic ascorbate (P-AscH-) is hypothesized to be an iron (Fe)-dependent tumor-specific adjuvant to chemoradiation in treating glioblastoma (GBM). This study determined the efficacy of combining P-AscH- with radiation and temozolomide in a phase II clinical trial while simultaneously investigating a mechanism-based, noninvasive biomarker in T2* mapping to predict GBM response to P-AscH- in humans. The single-arm phase II clinical trial (NCT02344355) enrolled 55 subjects, with analysis performed 12 months following the completion of treatment. Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were estimated with the Kaplan-Meier method and compared across patient subgroups with log-rank tests. Forty-nine of 55 subjects were evaluated using T2*-based MRI to assess its utility as an Fe-dependent biomarker. Median OS was estimated to be 19.6 months [90% confidence interval (CI), 15.7-26.5 months], a statistically significant increase compared with historic control patients (14.6 months). Subjects with initial T2* relaxation < 50 ms were associated with a significant increase in PFS compared with T2*-high subjects (11.2 months vs. 5.7 months, P < 0.05) and a trend toward increased OS (26.5 months vs. 17.5 months). These results were validated in preclinical in vitro and in vivo model systems. P-AscH- combined with temozolomide and radiotherapy has the potential to significantly enhance GBM survival. T2*-based MRI assessment of tumor iron content is a prognostic biomarker for GBM clinical outcomes. See related commentary by Nabavizadeh and Bagley, p. 255.",1589
37773213,Prediction of high Ki-67 proliferation index of gastrointestinal stromal tumors based on CT at non-contrast-enhanced and different contrast-enhanced phases.,European radiology,2024,"To evaluate and analyze radiomics models based on non-contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) and different phases of contrast-enhanced CT in predicting Ki-67 proliferation index (PI) among patients with pathologically confirmed gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs). A total of 383 patients with pathologically proven GIST were divided into a training set (n = 218, vendor 1) and 2 validation sets (n = 96, vendor 2; n = 69, vendors 3-5). Radiomics features extracted from the most recent non-contrast-enhanced and three contrast-enhanced CT scan prior to pathological examination. Random forest models were trained for each phase to predict tumors with high Ki-67 proliferation index (Ki-67>10%) and were evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and other metrics on the validation sets. Out of 107 radiomics features extracted from each phase of CT images, four were selected for analysis. The model trained using the non-contrast-enhanced phase achieved an AUC of 0.792 in the training set and 0.822 and 0.711 in the two validation sets, similar to models trained on different contrast-enhanced phases (p > 0.05). Several relevant features, including NGTDM Busyness and tumor size, remained predictive in non-contrast-enhanced and different contrast-enhanced images. The results of this study indicate that a radiomics model based on non-contrast-enhanced CT matches that of models based on different phases of contrast-enhanced CT in predicting the Ki-67 PI of GIST. GIST may exhibit similar radiological patterns irrespective of the use of contrast agent, and such radiomics features may help quantify these patterns to predict Ki-67 PI of GISTs. GIST may exhibit similar radiomics patterns irrespective of contrast agent; thus, radiomics models based on non-contrast-enhanced CT could be an alternative for risk stratification in GIST patients with contraindication to contrast agent. • Performance of radiomics models in predicting Ki-67 proliferation based on different CT phases is evaluated. • Non-contrast-enhanced CT-based radiomics models performed similarly to contrast-enhanced CT in risk stratification in GIST patients. • NGTDM Busyness remains stable to contrast agents in GISTs in radiomics models.",2263
37750777,Four-dimensional Flow MRI Assessment of Portal Hemodynamics and Hepatic Regeneration after Portal Vein Embolization.,Radiology,2023,"Background Percutaneous transhepatic portal vein (PV) embolization (PVE) is a standard preoperative procedure for advanced biliary cancer when the future liver remnant (FLR) is insufficient, yet the effect of this procedure on portal hemodynamics is still unclear. Purpose To assess whether four-dimensional (4D) MRI flowmetry can be used to estimate FLR volume and to identify the optimal time for this measurement. Materials and Methods This prospective single-center study enrolled consecutive adult patients with biliary cancer who underwent percutaneous transhepatic PVE for the right liver between June 2020 and November 2022. Portal hemodynamics were assessed using 4D flow MRI before PVE and within 1 day (0-day group) or 3-4 days (3-day group) after PVE. FLR volume was measured using CT before PVE and after PVE but before surgery. Blood flow changes were analyzed with the Wilcoxon signed rank test, and correlations with Spearman rank correlation. Results The 0-day group included 24 participants (median age, 72 years [IQR, 69-77 years]; 17 male participants), and the 3-day group included 13 participants (median age, 71 years [IQR, 68-78 years]; eight male participants). Both groups showed increased left PV (LPV) flow rate after PVE (0-day group: from median 3.72 mL/sec [IQR, 2.83-4.55 mL/sec] to 9.48 mL/sec [IQR, 8.12-10.7 mL/sec], ",1352

37750771,Association of Breast Cancer Odds with Background Parenchymal Enhancement Quantified Using a Fully Automated Method at MRI: The IMAGINE Study.,Radiology,2023,"Background Background parenchymal enhancement (BPE) at breast MRI has been associated with increased breast cancer risk in several independent studies. However, variability of subjective BPE assessments have precluded its use in clinical practice. Purpose To examine the association between fully objective measures of BPE at MRI and odds of breast cancer. Materials and Methods This prospective case-control study included patients who underwent a bilateral breast MRI examination and were receiving care at one of three centers in the United States from November 2010 to July 2017. Breast volume, fibroglandular tissue (FGT) volume, and BPE were quantified using fully automated software. Fat volume was defined as breast volume minus FGT volume. BPE extent was defined as the proportion of FGT voxels with enhancement of 20% or more. Spearman rank correlation between quantitative BPE extent and Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) BPE categories assigned by an experienced board-certified breast radiologist was estimated. With use of multivariable logistic regression, breast cancer case-control status was regressed on tertiles (low, moderate, and high) of BPE, FGT volume, and fat volume, with adjustment for covariates. Results In total, 536 case participants with breast cancer (median age, 48 years [IQR, 43-55 years]) and 940 cancer-free controls (median age, 46 years [IQR, 38-55 years]) were included.

37737870,Membranous urethral length measurement on preoperative MRI to predict incontinence after radical prostatectomy: a literature review towards a proposal for measurement standardization.,European radiology,2024,"To investigate the membranous urethral length (MUL) measurement and its interobserver agreement, and propose literature-based recommendations to standardize MUL measurement for increasing interobserver agreement. MUL measurements based on prostate MRI scans, for urinary incontinence risk assessment before radical prostatectomy (RP), may influence treatment decision-making in men with localised prostate cancer. Before implementation in clinical practise, MRI-based MUL measurements need standardization to improve observer agreement. Online libraries were searched up to August 5, 2022, on MUL measurements. Two reviewers performed article selection and critical appraisal. Papers reporting on preoperative MUL measurements and urinary continence correlation were selected. Extracted information included measuring procedures, MRI sequences, population mean/median values, and observer agreement. Fifty papers were included. Studies that specified the MRI sequence used T2-weighted images and used either coronal images (n = 13), sagittal images (n = 18), or both (n = 12) for MUL measurements. 'Prostatic apex' was the most common description of the proximal membranous urethra landmark and 'level/entry of the urethra into the penile bulb' was the most common description of the distal landmark. Population mean (median) MUL value range was 10.4-17.1 mm (7.3-17.3 mm), suggesting either population or measurement differences. Detailed measurement technique descriptions for reproducibility were lacking. Recommendations on MRI-based MUL measurement were formulated by using anatomical landmarks and detailed descriptions and illustrations. In order to improve on measurement variability, a literature-based measuring method of the MUL was proposed, supported by several illustrative case studies, in an attempt to standardize MRI-based MUL measurements for appropriate urinary incontinence risk preoperatively. Implementation of MUL measurements into clinical practise for personalized post-prostatectomy continence prediction is hampered by lack of standardization and suboptimal interobserver agreement. Our proposed standardized MUL measurement aims to facilitate standardization and to improve the interobserver agreement. • Variable approaches for membranous urethral length measurement are being used, without detailed description and with substantial differences in length of the membranous urethra, hampering standardization. • Limited interobserver agreement for membranous urethral length measurement was observed in several studies, while preoperative incontinence risk assessment necessitates high interobserver agreement. • Literature-based recommendations are proposed to standardize MRI-based membranous urethral length measurement for increasing interobserver agreement and improving preoperative incontinence risk assessment, using anatomical landmarks on sagittal T2-weighted images.",2906
37736804,Delta-radiomics features for predicting the major pathological response to neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy in non-small cell lung cancer.,European radiology,2024,"To investigate if delta-radiomics features have the potential to predict the major pathological response (MPR) to neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. Two hundred six stage IIA-IIIB NSCLC patients from three institutions (Database1 = 164; Database2 = 21; Database3 = 21) who received neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy and surgery were included. Patients in Database1 were randomly assigned to the training dataset and test dataset, with a ratio of 0.7:0.3. Patients in Database2 and Database3 were used as two independent external validation datasets. Contrast-enhanced CT scans were obtained at baseline and before surgery. The delta-radiomics features were defined as the relative net change of radiomics features between baseline and preoperative. The delta-radiomics model and pre-treatment radiomics model were established. The performance of Immune-Related Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (iRECIST) for predicting MPR was also evaluated. Half of the patients (106/206, 51.5%) showed MPR after neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy. For predicting MPR, the delta-radiomics model achieved a satisfying area under the curves (AUCs) values of 0.768, 0.732, 0.833, and 0.716 in the training, test, and two external validation databases, respectively, which showed a superior predictive performance than the pre-treatment radiomics model (0.644, 0.616, 0.475, and 0.608). Compared with iRECIST criteria (0.624, 0.572, 0.650, and 0.466), a mixed model that combines delta-radiomics features and iRECIST had higher AUC values for MPR prediction of 0.777, 0.761, 0.850, and 0.670 in four sets. The delta-radiomics model demonstrated superior diagnostic performance compared to pre-treatment radiomics model and iRECIST criteria in predicting MPR preoperatively in neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy for stage II-III NSCLC. Delta-radiomics features based on the relative net change of radiomics features between baseline and preoperative CT scans serve a vital support tool in accurately identifying responses to neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy, which can help physicians make more appropriate treatment decisions. • The performances of pre-treatment radiomics model and iRECIST model in predicting major pathological response of neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy were unsatisfactory. • The delta-radiomics features based on relative net change of radiomics features between baseline and preoperative CT scans may be used as a noninvasive biomarker for predicting major pathological response of neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy. • Combining delta-radiomics features and iRECIST can further improve the predictive performance of responses to neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy.",2703
37736802,Structural connectome combining DTI features predicts postoperative language decline and its recovery in glioma patients.,European radiology,2024,"A decline in language function is a common complication after glioma surgery, affecting patients' quality of life and survival. This study predicts the postoperative decline in language function and whether it can be recovered based on the preoperative white matter structural network. Eighty-one right-handed patients with glioma involving the left hemisphere were retrospectively included. Their language function was assessed using the Western Aphasia Battery before and 1 week and 3 months after surgery. Structural connectome combining DTI features was selected to predict postoperative language decline and recovery. Nested cross-validation was used to optimize the models, evaluate the prediction performance of the models, and identify the most predictive features. Five, seven, and seven features were finally selected as the predictive features in each model and used to establish predictive models for postoperative language decline (1 week after surgery), long-term language decline (3 months after surgery), and language recovery, respectively. The overall accuracy of the three models in nested cross-validation and overall area under the receiver operating characteristic curve were 0.840, 0.790, and 0.867, and 0.841, 0.778, and 0.901, respectively. We used machine learning algorithms to establish models to predict whether the language function of glioma patients will decline after surgery and whether postoperative language deficit can recover, which may help improve the development of treatment strategies. The difference in features in the non-language decline or the language recovery group may reflect the structural basis for the protection and compensation of language function in gliomas. Models can predict the postoperative language decline and whether it can recover in glioma patients, possibly improving the development of treatment strategies. The difference in selected features may reflect the structural basis for the protection and compensation of language function. • Structural connectome combining diffusion tensor imaging features predicted glioma patients' language decline after surgery. • Structural connectome combining diffusion tensor imaging features predicted language recovery of glioma patients with postoperative language disorder. • Diffusion tensor imaging and connectome features related to language function changes imply plastic brain regions and connections.",2417
37733788,Near-Infrared Spectral Tomography for Predicting Residual Cancer Burden during Early-Stage Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy for Breast Cancer.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,2023,"The aim of this study is to investigate whether near-infrared spectral tomography (NIRST) might serve as a reliable prognostic tool to predict residual cancer burden (RCB) in patients with breast cancer undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) based upon early treatment response measurements. A total of thirty-five patients with breast cancer receiving NAC were included in this study. NIRST imaging was performed at multiple time points, including: before treatment, at end of the first cycle, at the mid-point, and post-NAC treatments. From reconstructed NIRST images, average values of total hemoglobin (HbT) were obtained for both the tumor region and contralateral breast at each time point. RCB scores/classes were assessed by a pathologist using histologic slides of the surgical specimen obtained after completing NAC. Logistic regression of the normalized early percentage change of HbT in the tumor region (ΔHbT%) was used to predict RCB and determine its significance as an indicator for differentiating cases within each RCB class. The ΔHbT% at the end of the first cycle, as compared with pretreatment levels, showed excellent prognostic capability in differentiating RCB-0 from RCB-I/II/III or RCB-II from RCB-0/I/III (P < 0.001). Corresponding area under the curve (AUC) values for these comparisons were 0.97 and 0.94, and accuracy values were 0.90 and 0.83, respectively. NIRST holds promise as a potential clinical tool that can be seamlessly integrated into existing clinical workflow within the infusion suite. By providing early assessment of RCB, NIRST has potential to improve breast cancer patient management strategies.",1647
37733364,Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy vs No Axillary Surgery in Patients With Small Breast Cancer and Negative Results on Ultrasonography of Axillary Lymph Nodes: The SOUND Randomized Clinical Trial.,JAMA oncology,2023,"Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is the standard of care for axillary node staging of patients with early breast cancer (BC), but its necessity can be questioned since surgery for examination of axillary nodes is not performed with curative intent. To determine whether the omission of axillary surgery is noninferior to SLNB in patients with small BC and a negative result on preoperative axillary lymph node ultrasonography. The SOUND (Sentinel Node vs Observation After Axillary Ultra-Sound) trial was a prospective noninferiority phase 3 randomized clinical trial conducted in Italy, Switzerland, Spain, and Chile. A total of 1463 women of any age with BC up to 2 cm and a negative preoperative axillary ultrasonography result were enrolled and randomized between February 6, 2012, and June 30, 2017. Of those, 1405 were included in the intention-to-treat analysis. Data were analyzed from October 10, 2022, to January 13, 2023. Eligible patients were randomized on a 1:1 ratio to receive SLNB (SLNB group) or no axillary surgery (no axillary surgery group). The primary end point of the study was distant disease-free survival (DDFS) at 5 years, analyzed as intention to treat. Secondary end points were the cumulative incidence of distant recurrences, the cumulative incidence of axillary recurrences, DFS, overall survival (OS), and the adjuvant treatment recommendations. Among 1405 women (median [IQR] age, 60 [52-68] years) included in the intention-to-treat analysis, 708 were randomized to the SLNB group, and 697 were randomized to the no axillary surgery group. Overall, the median (IQR) tumor size was 1.1 (0.8-1.5) cm, and 1234 patients (87.8%) had estrogen receptor-positive ERBB2 (formerly HER2 or HER2/neu), nonoverexpressing BC. In the SLNB group, 97 patients (13.7%) had positive axillary nodes. The median (IQR) follow-up for disease assessment was 5.7 (5.0-6.8) years in the SLNB group and 5.7 (5.0-6.6) years in the no axillary surgery group. Five-year distant DDFS was 97.7% in the SLNB group and 98.0% in the no axillary surgery group (log-rank P = .67; hazard ratio, 0.84; 90% CI, 0.45-1.54; noninferiority P = .02). A total of 12 (1.7%) locoregional relapses, 13 (1.8%) distant metastases, and 21 (3.0%) deaths were observed in the SLNB group, and 11 (1.6%) locoregional relapses, 14 (2.0%) distant metastases, and 18 (2.6%) deaths were observed in the no axillary surgery group. In this randomized clinical trial, omission of axillary surgery was noninferior to SLNB in patients with small BC and a negative result on ultrasonography of the axillary lymph nodes. These results suggest that patients with these features can be safely spared any axillary surgery whenever the lack of pathological information does not affect the postoperative treatment plan.

37732903,Deuterium Magnetic Resonance Imaging Using Deuterated Water-Induced 2H-Tissue Labeling Allows Monitoring Cancer Treatment at Clinical Field Strength.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,2023,"An accurate and noninvasive assessment of tumor response following treatment other than traditional anatomical imaging techniques is essential. Deuterium magnetic resonance spectroscopic (MRS) imaging has been demonstrated as an alternative for cancer metabolic imaging by high-field MRI using deuterium-labeled molecules. The study aim was to use 2H tissue labeling and deuterium MRI at clinical field strength for tumor visualization and assessment of three anticancer therapies in pancreatic cancer model mice. MIA PaCa-2 pancreatic carcinoma and C26 colorectal carcinoma models of BALB/c-nu mice was prepared, and repeated deuterium MRI was performed during the first 10 days of free drinking of 30% D2O to track 2H distribution in tissues. 2H accumulation in the tumor after irradiation, bevacizumab administration, or gemcitabine administration was also measured in MIA PaCa-2-bearing mice. Confirmatory proton MRI, ex vivo metabolic hyperpolarization 13C-MRS, and histopathology were performed. The mouse's whole-body distribution of 2H was visible 1 day after drinking, and the signal intensity increased daily. Although the tumor size did not change 1 and 3 days after irradiation, the amount of 2H decreased significantly. The 2H image intensity of the tumor also significantly decreased after the administration of bevacizumab or gemcitabine. Metabolic hyperpolarization 13C-MRS, proton MRI, and 2H-NMR spectroscopy confirmed the efficacy of the anticancer treatments. Deuterium MRI at 1.5T proved feasible to track 2H distribution throughout mouse tissues during D2O administration and revealed a higher 2H accumulation in the tumor xenografts. This research demonstrated a promising successful method for preliminary assessment of radiotherapy and chemotherapy of cancer.",1784
37731096,Hepatobiliary phase imaging in cirrhotic patients using compressed sensing and controlled aliasing in parallel imaging results in higher acceleration.,European radiology,2024,"We aimed to compare the image quality and focal lesion detection ability of hepatobiliary phase (HBP) images obtained using compressed sensing (CS) and controlled aliasing in parallel imaging results in higher acceleration (CAIPIRINHA) in patients with liver cirrhosis. We retrospectively included 244 gadoxetic acid-enhanced liver MRI from 244 patients with cirrhosis obtained by two HBP images using CS and CAIPIRINHA from July 2020 to December 2020. The optimized resolution and scan time for CS-HBP and CAIPIRINHA-HBP were 0.9 × 0.9 × 1.5 mm CS-HBP showed comparable overall image quality (3.7 ± 0.9 vs. 3.6 ± 0.8, p = 0.680), superior liver edge sharpness (3.9 ± 0.6 vs. 3.6 ± 0.5, p < 0.001), and fewer respiratory motion artifacts (4.0 ± 0.7 vs. 3.8 ± 0.5, p < 0.001), but higher non-respiratory artifacts (3.4 ± 0.7 vs. 3.6 ± 0.6, p < 0.001) and subjective image noise (3.5 ± 0.8 vs. 3.6 ± 0.7, p = 0.014) than CAIPIRINHA-HBP. CS-HBP showed a higher signal-to-noise ratio in the liver than CAIPIRINHA-HBP (20.9 ± 9.0 vs. 18.9 ± 7.1, p = 0.008). The pooled sensitivity, specificity, and AUC were 90.0%, 77.5%, and 0.84 for CS-HBP and 73.5%, 82.4%, and 0.78 for CAIPIRINHA-HBP, respectively. CS-HBP showed better focal lesion detection ability, comparable overall image quality, and fewer respiratory motion artifacts, but higher non-respiratory artifacts and noise compared to CAIPIRINHA-HBP. Thus, CS-HBP could be recommended for liver MRI in patients with cirrhosis to improve diagnostic performance. Thin-slice CS-HBP may be useful for detecting sub-centimeter hepatocellular carcinoma in cirrhotic patients with Child-Pugh classification A while maintaining comparable subjective image quality. • Compared with controlled aliasing in parallel imaging results in higher acceleration, compressed sensing hepatobiliary phase yielded thinner slices and shorter scan time at a higher accelerating factor. • Compressed sensing hepatobiliary phase showed comparable overall image quality, superior liver edge sharpness, and fewer respiratory motion artifacts, but higher non-respiratory artifacts and subjective image noise than controlled aliasing in parallel imaging results in higher acceleration-hepatobiliary phase. • Compressed sensing hepatobiliary phase can detect sub-centimeter hepatocellular carcinoma in cirrhotic patients with Child-Pugh classification A.",2372
37729554,Imaging of Alcohol-Associated Liver Disease.,AJR. American journal of roentgenology,2024,"Alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) continues to be a global health concern, responsible for a significant number of deaths worldwide. Although most individuals who consume alcohol do not develop ALD, heavy drinkers and binge drinkers are at increased risk. Unfortunately, ALD is often undetected until it reaches advanced stages, frequently associated with portal hypertension and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). ALD is now the leading indication for liver transplant. The incidence of alcohol-associated hepatitis (AH) surged during the COVID-19 pandemic. Early diagnosis of ALD is therefore important in patient management and determination of prognosis, as abstinence can halt disease progression. The spectrum of ALD includes steatosis, steatohepatitis, and cirrhosis, with steatosis the most common manifestation. Diagnostic techniques including ultrasound, CT, and MRI provide useful information for identifying ALD and excluding other causes of liver dysfunction. Heterogeneous steatosis and transient perfusion changes on CT and MRI in the clinical setting of alcohol-use disorder are diagnostic of severe AH. Elastography techniques are useful for assessing fibrosis and monitoring treatment response. These various imaging modalities are also useful in HCC surveillance and diagnosis. This review discusses the imaging modalities currently used in the evaluation of ALD, highlighting their strengths, limitations, and clinical applications.",1454
37724967,Comparison of the Diagnostic Accuracy of Mammogram-based Deep Learning and Traditional Breast Cancer Risk Models in Patients Who Underwent Supplemental Screening with MRI.,Radiology,2023,"Background Access to supplemental screening breast MRI is determined using traditional risk models, which are limited by modest predictive accuracy. Purpose To compare the diagnostic accuracy of a mammogram-based deep learning (DL) risk assessment model to that of traditional breast cancer risk models in patients who underwent supplemental screening with MRI. Materials and Methods This retrospective study included consecutive patients undergoing breast cancer screening MRI from September 2017 to September 2020 at four facilities. Risk was assessed using the Tyrer-Cuzick (TC) and National Cancer Institute Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool (BCRAT) 5-year and lifetime models as well as a DL 5-year model that generated a risk score based on the most recent screening mammogram. A risk score of 1.67% or higher defined increased risk for traditional 5-year models, a risk score of 20% or higher defined high risk for traditional lifetime models, and absolute scores of 2.3 or higher and 6.6 or higher defined increased and high risk, respectively, for the DL model. Model accuracy metrics including cancer detection rate (CDR) and positive predictive values (PPVs) (PPV of abnormal findings at screening [PPV1], PPV of biopsies recommended [PPV2], and PPV of biopsies performed [PPV3]) were compared using logistic regression models. Results This study included 2168 women who underwent 4247 high-risk screening MRI examinations (median age, 54 years [IQR, 48-60 years]). CDR (per 1000 examinations) was higher in patients at high risk according to the DL model (20.6 [95% CI: 11.8, 35.6]) than according to the TC (6.0 [95% CI: 2.9, 12.3]; ",1647

Purpose To evaluate AI prediction variability as an uncertainty quantification (UQ) metric for identifying cases at risk of AI failure in diagnosing cancer at MRI and CT across different cancer types, data sets, and algorithms. Materials and Methods Multicenter data sets and publicly available AI algorithms from three previous studies that evaluated detection of pancreatic cancer on contrast-enhanced CT images, detection of prostate cancer on MRI scans, and prediction of pulmonary nodule malignancy on low-dose CT images were analyzed retrospectively. Each task's algorithm was extended to generate an uncertainty score based on ensemble prediction variability. AI accuracy percentage and partial area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (pAUC) were compared between certain and uncertain patient groups in a range of percentile thresholds (10%-90%) for the uncertainty score using permutation tests for statistical significance. The pulmonary nodule malignancy prediction algorithm was compared with 11 clinical readers for the certain group (CG) and uncertain group (UG). Results In total, 18 022 images were used for training and 838 images were used for testing. AI diagnostic accuracy was higher for the cases in the CG across all tasks (",1455
37707548,Can multi-modal radiomics using pretreatment ultrasound and tomosynthesis predict response to neoadjuvant systemic treatment in breast cancer?,European radiology,2024,"Response assessment to neoadjuvant systemic treatment (NAST) to guide individualized treatment in breast cancer is a clinical research priority. We aimed to develop an intelligent algorithm using multi-modal pretreatment ultrasound and tomosynthesis radiomics features in addition to clinical variables to predict pathologic complete response (pCR) prior to the initiation of therapy. We used retrospective data on patients who underwent ultrasound and tomosynthesis before starting NAST. We developed a support vector machine algorithm using pretreatment ultrasound and tomosynthesis radiomics features in addition to patient and tumor variables to predict pCR status (ypT0 and ypN0). Findings were compared to the histopathologic evaluation of the surgical specimen. The main outcome measures were area under the curve (AUC) and false-negative rate (FNR). We included 720 patients, 504 in the development set and 216 in the validation set. Median age was 51.6 years and 33.6% (242 of 720) achieved pCR. The addition of radiomics features significantly improved the performance of the algorithm (AUC 0.72 to 0.81; p = 0.007). The FNR of the multi-modal radiomics and clinical algorithm was 6.7% (10 of 150 with missed residual cancer). Surface/volume ratio at tomosynthesis and peritumoral entropy characteristics at ultrasound were the most relevant radiomics. Hormonal receptors and HER-2 status were the most important clinical predictors. A multi-modal machine learning algorithm with pretreatment clinical, ultrasound, and tomosynthesis radiomics features may aid in predicting residual cancer after NAST. Pending prospective validation, this may facilitate individually tailored NAST regimens. Multi-modal radiomics using pretreatment ultrasound and tomosynthesis showed significant improvement in assessing response to NAST compared to an algorithm using clinical variables only. Further prospective validation of our findings seems warranted to enable individualized predictions of NAST outcomes. • We proposed a multi-modal machine learning algorithm with pretreatment clinical, ultrasound, and tomosynthesis radiomics features to predict response to neoadjuvant breast cancer treatment. • Compared with the clinical algorithm, the AUC of this integrative algorithm is significantly higher. • Used prior to the initiative of therapy, our algorithm can identify patients who will experience pathologic complete response following neoadjuvant therapy with a high negative predictive value.",2497

This multicenter retrospective study included 218 solitary HCC patients who underwent gadobenate dimeglumine-enhanced MRI. All HCC lesions were resected and pathologically confirmed. The lesion-to-liver contrast enhancement ratio (LLCER) and lesion-to-liver contrast (LLC) were measured in the hepatobiliary phase. Potential risk factors for proliferative HCC were assessed by logistic regression. The ability of LLCER and LLC to predict proliferative HCC was assessed by the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Prognostic factors were evaluated using the Cox proportional hazards regression model for survival outcomes. LLCER was an independent predictor of proliferative HCC (odds ratio, 0.015; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.008-0.022; p < 0.001). The area under the ROC curve was 0.812 (95% CI, 0.748-0.877), higher than that of LLC, alpha-fetoprotein > 100 ng/ml, satellite nodules, and rim arterial phase hyperenhancement (all p ≤ 0.001). HCC patients with LLCER < -4.59% had a significantly higher incidence of proliferative HCC than those with the LLCER ≥ -4.59%. During the follow-up period, LLCER was an independent predictor of overall survival (hazard ratio, 0.070; 95% CI, 0.015-0.324; p = 0.001) in HCC patients. Gadobenate dimeglumine-enhanced quantitative parameter in the hepatobiliary phase can predict the proliferative subtype of solitary HCC with a moderately high accuracy. Quantitative information from gadobenate dimeglumine-enhanced MRI can provide crucial information on hepatocellular carcinoma subtypes. It might be valuable to design novel therapeutic strategies, such as targeted therapies or immunotherapy. • The lesion-to-liver contrast enhancement ratio (LLCER) is an independent predictor of proliferative hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). • The ability of LLCER to predict proliferative HCC outperformed lesion-to-liver contrast, alpha-fetoprotein > 100 ng/ml, satellite nodules, and rim arterial phase hyperenhancement. • HCC patients with LLCER < -4.59% had a significantly higher incidence of proliferative HCC than those with the LLCER ≥ -4.59%.",2313

Oncologic patients were prospectively enrolled and underwent contrast-enhanced CT. Images were reconstructed with DLIR with three intensity levels of reconstruction (high, medium, and low) and ASiR-V at strength levels from 10 to 100% with a 10% interval. Three radiologists characterized the lesions and two readers assessed diagnostic accuracy and calculated signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), figure of merit (FOM), and subjective image quality, the latter with a 5-point Likert scale. Fifty patients (mean age: 70 ± 10 years, 23 men) were enrolled and 130 liver lesions (105 benign lesions, 25 metastases) were identified. DLIR_H achieved the highest SNR and CNR, comparable to ASiR-V 100% (p ≥ .051). DLIR_M returned the highest subjective image quality (score: 5; IQR: 4-5; p ≤ .001) and significant median increase (29%) in FOM (p < .001). Differences in detection were identified only for lesions ≤ 0.5 cm: 32/33 lesions were detected with DLIR_M and 26 lesions were detected with ASiR-V 50% (p = .031). Lesion accuracy of was 93.8% (95% CI: 88.1, 97.3; 122 of 130 lesions) for DLIR and 87.7% (95% CI: 80.8, 92.8; 114 of 130 lesions) for ASiR-V 50%. DLIR yields superior image quality and provides higher diagnostic accuracy compared to ASiR-V in the assessment of hypovascular liver lesions, in particular for lesions ≤ 0.5 cm. Deep learning image reconstruction algorithm demonstrates higher diagnostic accuracy compared to iterative reconstruction in the identification of hypovascular liver lesions, especially for lesions ≤ 0.5 cm. • Iterative reconstruction algorithm impacts image texture, with negative effects on diagnostic capabilities. • Medium-strength deep learning image reconstruction algorithm outperforms iterative reconstruction in the diagnostic accuracy of ≤ 0.5 cm hypovascular liver lesions (93.9% vs 78.8%), also granting higher objective and subjective image quality. • Deep learning image reconstruction algorithm can be safely implemented in routine abdominal CT protocols in place of iterative reconstruction.",2323

Here, we examine model performance in predicting 10-year outcomes in the BWHS, Women's Health Initiative-Extension Study (WHI-ES), and Multiethnic Cohort (MEC) and compare model performance to existing breast cancer prediction models. We used competing-risk regression and Royston and Altman methods for validating survival models to calculate our model's calibration and discrimination (C index) in BWHS (n = 17 380), WHI-ES (n = 106 894), and MEC (n = 49 668). The Nurses' Health Study development cohort (n = 48 102) regression coefficients were applied to the validation cohorts. We compared our model's performance with breast cancer risk assessment tool (Gail) and International Breast Cancer Intervention Study (IBIS) models by computing breast cancer risk estimates and C statistics. When predicting 10-year breast cancer risk, our model's C index was 0.569 in BWHS, 0.572 in WHI-ES, and 0.576 in MEC. The Gail model's C statistic was 0.554 in BWHS, 0.564 in WHI-ES, and 0.551 in MEC; IBIS's C statistic was 0.547 in BWHS, 0.552 in WHI-ES, and 0.562 in MEC. The Gail model underpredicted breast cancer risk in WHI-ES; IBIS underpredicted breast cancer risk in WHI-ES and in MEC but overpredicted breast cancer risk in BWHS. Our model calibrated well. Our model's C index for predicting 10-year nonbreast cancer death was 0.760 in WHI-ES and 0.763 in MEC. Our competing-risk model performs as well as existing breast cancer prediction models in diverse cohorts and predicts nonbreast cancer death.

37672053,Impact of signal intensity normalization of MRI on the generalizability of radiomic-based prediction of molecular glioma subtypes.,European radiology,2024,"Radiomic features have demonstrated encouraging results for non-invasive detection of molecular biomarkers, but the lack of guidelines for pre-processing MRI-data has led to poor generalizability. Here, we assessed the influence of different MRI-intensity normalization techniques on the performance of radiomics-based models for predicting molecular glioma subtypes. Preoperative MRI-data from n = 615 patients with newly diagnosed glioma and known isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) and 1p/19q status were pre-processed using four different methods: no normalization (naive), N4 bias field correction (N4), N4 followed by either WhiteStripe (N4/WS), or z-score normalization (N4/z-score). A total of 377 Image-Biomarker-Standardisation-Initiative-compliant radiomic features were extracted from each normalized data, and 9 different machine-learning algorithms were trained for multiclass prediction of molecular glioma subtypes (IDH-mutant 1p/19q codeleted vs. IDH-mutant 1p/19q non-codeleted vs. IDH wild type). External testing was performed in public glioma datasets from UCSF (n = 410) and TCGA (n = 160). Support vector machine yielded the best performance with macro-average AUCs of 0.84 (naive), 0.84 (N4), 0.87 (N4/WS), and 0.87 (N4/z-score) in the internal test set. Both N4/WS and z-score outperformed the other approaches in the external UCSF and TCGA test sets with macro-average AUCs ranging from 0.85 to 0.87, replicating the performance of the internal test set, in contrast to macro-average AUCs ranging from 0.19 to 0.45 for naive and 0.26 to 0.52 for N4 alone. Intensity normalization of MRI data is essential for the generalizability of radiomic-based machine-learning models. Specifically, both N4/WS and N4/z-score approaches allow to preserve the high model performance, yielding generalizable performance when applying the developed radiomic-based machine-learning model in an external heterogeneous, multi-institutional setting. Intensity normalization such as N4/WS or N4/z-score can be used to develop reliable radiomics-based machine learning models from heterogeneous multicentre MRI datasets and provide non-invasive prediction of glioma subtypes. • MRI-intensity normalization increases the stability of radiomics-based models and leads to better generalizability. • Intensity normalization did not appear relevant when the developed model was applied to homogeneous data from the same institution. • Radiomic-based machine learning algorithms are a promising approach for simultaneous classification of IDH and 1p/19q status of glioma.",2565

In this study, we aimed to non-invasively diagnose teratomas based on fractal and radiomic features. This retrospective study included 330 IGCT patients, including a discovery set (n = 296) and an independent validation set (n = 34). Fractal and radiomic features were extracted from T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and post-contrast T1-weighted images. Five classifiers, including logistic regression, random forests, support vector machines, K-nearest neighbours, and XGBoost, were compared for our task. Based on the optimal classifier, we compared the performance of clinical, fractal, and radiomic models and the model combining these features in predicting teratomas.

37668519,Functional MRI in Neuro-Oncology: State of the Art and Future Directions.,Radiology,2023,"Since its discovery in the early 1990s, functional MRI (fMRI) has been used to study human brain function. One well-established application of fMRI in the clinical setting is the neurosurgical planning of patients with brain tumors near eloquent cortical areas. Clinical fMRI aims to preoperatively identify eloquent cortices that serve essential functions in daily life, such as hand movement and language. The primary goal of neurosurgery is to maximize tumor resection while sparing eloquent cortices adjacent to the tumor. When a lesion presents in the vicinity of an eloquent cortex, surgeons may use fMRI to plan their best surgical approach by determining the proximity of the lesion to regions of activation, providing guidance for awake brain surgery and intraoperative brain mapping. The acquisition of fMRI requires patient preparation prior to imaging, determination of functional paradigms, monitoring of patient performance, and both processing and analysis of images. Interpretation of fMRI maps requires a strong understanding of functional neuroanatomy and familiarity with the technical limitations frequently present in brain tumor imaging, including neurovascular uncoupling, patient compliance, and data analysis.

37665391,Achieving imaging and computational reproducibility on multiparametric MRI radiomics features in brain tumor diagnosis: phantom and clinical validation.,European radiology,2024,"The Image Biomarker Standardization Initiative has helped improve the computational reproducibility of MRI radiomics features. Nonetheless, the MRI sequences and features with high imaging reproducibility are yet to be established. To determine reproducible multiparametric MRI radiomics features across test-retest, multi-scanner, and computational reproducibility comparisons, and to evaluate their clinical value in brain tumor diagnosis. To assess reproducibility, T1-weighted imaging (T1WI), T2-weighted imaging (T2WI), and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) were acquired from three 3-T MRI scanners using standardized phantom, and radiomics features were extracted using two computational algorithms. Reproducible radiomics features were selected when the concordance correlation coefficient value above 0.9 across multiple sessions, scanners, and computational algorithms. Random forest classifiers were trained with reproducible features (n = 117) and validated in a clinical cohort (n = 50) to evaluate whether features with high reproducibility improved the differentiation of glioblastoma from primary central nervous system lymphomas (PCNSLs). Radiomics features from T2WI demonstrated higher repeatability (65-94%) than those from DWI (38-48%) or T1WI (2-92%). Across test-retest, multi-scanner, and computational comparisons, T2WI provided 41 reproducible features, DWI provided six, and T1WI provided two. The performance of the classification model with reproducible features was higher than that using non-reproducible features in both training set (AUC, 0.916 vs. 0.877) and validation set (AUC, 0.957 vs. 0.869). Radiomics features with high reproducibility across multiple sessions, scanners, and computational algorithms were identified, and they showed higher diagnostic performance than non-reproducible radiomics features in the differentiation of glioblastoma from PCNSL. By identifying the radiomics features showing higher multi-machine reproducibility, our results also demonstrated higher radiomics diagnostic performance in the differentiation of glioblastoma from PCNSL, paving the way for further research designs and clinical application in neuro-oncology. • Highly reproducible radiomics features across multiple sessions, scanners, and computational algorithms were identified using phantom and applied to clinical diagnosis. • Radiomics features from T2-weighted imaging were more reproducible than those from T1-weighted and diffusion-weighted imaging. • Radiomics features with good reproducibility had better diagnostic performance for brain tumors than features with poor reproducibility.",2627

Additionally, the factors influencing the completed absorption of ablation (CAA) were examined. A total of 62 cases with 62 nodules underwent ultrasound-guided RFA and were included in the study. The volume reduction rate (VRR), CAA, and incomplete absorption of ablation (IAA) were assessed at the 1st, 3rd, 6th, and subsequent 6-month follow-ups. Clinical and ultrasound features were compared between the CAA and IAA groups at the 12th month follow-up. The average VRR at the 1st, 3rd, 6th, 12th month, and last follow-up were -88.6%, 16.0%, 59.7%, 82.0%, and 98.2%, respectively. More than half of the nodules achieved a 90% VRR after 1 year of RFA, with 88.7% demonstrating CAA at the end of the study (follow-up duration of 14 to 63 months). Nodules with grade 3 vascularity and those associated with chronic thyroiditis showed delayed CAA at the 12th month follow-up (p = 0.036 and 0.003, respectively). RFA is an effective technique for treating ≤ 2 cm thyroid nodules with Bethesda IV cytology and C-TIRADS 4A categorization.

Among patients with clinical stage I lung adenocarcinomas, half of patients were randomly selected for a diagnostic study, in which five thoracic radiologists determined the presence of CT-VPI. Probabilities for CT-VPI were obtained using deep learning (DL). Areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUCs) and binary diagnostic measures were calculated and compared. Inter-rater agreement was assessed. For all patients, the prognostic value of CT-VPI by two radiologists and DL (using high-sensitivity and high-specificity cutoffs) was investigated using Cox regression. In 681 patients (median age, 65 years [interquartile range, 58-71]; 382 women), pathologic VPI was positive in 130 patients. For the diagnostic study (n = 339), the pooled AUC of five radiologists was similar to that of DL (0.78 vs. 0.79; p = 0.76). The binary diagnostic performance of radiologists was variable (sensitivity, 45.3-71.9%; specificity, 71.6-88.7%). Inter-rater agreement was moderate (weighted Fleiss κ, 0.51; 95%CI: 0.43-0.55). For overall survival (n = 680), CT-VPI by radiologists (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 1.27 and 0.99; 95%CI: 0.84-1.92 and 0.63-1.56; p = 0.26 and 0.97) or DL (HR, 1.44 and 1.06; 95%CI: 0.86-2.42 and 0.67-1.68; p = 0.17 and 0.80) was not prognostic. CT-VPI by an attending radiologist was prognostic only in radiologically solid tumors (HR, 1.82; 95%CI: 1.07-3.07; p = 0.03). The diagnostic performance and prognostic value of CT-VPI are limited in clinical stage I lung adenocarcinomas. This feature may be applied for radiologically solid tumors, but substantial reader variability should be overcome. Although the diagnostic performance and prognostic value of CT-VPI are limited in clinical stage I lung adenocarcinomas, this parameter may be applied for radiologically solid tumors with appropriate caution regarding inter-reader variability. • Use of CT-defined visceral pleural invasion in clinical staging should be cautious, because prognostic value of CT-defined visceral pleural invasion remains unexplored. • Diagnostic performance and prognostic value of CT-defined visceral pleural invasion varied among radiologists and deep learning. • Role of CT-defined visceral pleural invasion in clinical staging may be limited to radiologically solid tumors.",2438

In this retrospective study, 69 patients with locally recurrent high-grade gliomas (HGGs) were included. The cohort was divided into intra-resection cavity recurrence (ICR) and extra-resection cavity recurrence (ECR) patterns, according to the distance between the location of the recurrent tumor and the resection cavity or surgical region. Four vascular habitats, high angiogenic tumor, low angiogenic tumor, infiltrated peripheral edema, and vasogenic peripheral edema, were segmented and vascular heterogeneity parameters were analyzed. The survival and diagnostic performance under different spatial recurrence patterns were analyzed by Kaplan-Meier and ROC. A nomogram model was constructed by regression analysis and validated by bootstrapping technique. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were longer for ICR (n = 32) than those for ECR (n = 37) (median PFS: 8 vs. 5 months, median OS: 17 vs. 13 months, p < 0.05). MRI vascular habitat analyses showed ECR had higher median relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV The spatial pattern of locally recurrent HGGs is associated with prognosis.

Vascular heterogeneity parameters based on MRI vascular habitat analyses can non-invasively predict the spatial patterns of locally recurrent high-grade gliomas, providing a new diagnostic basis for clinicians to develop the extent of surgical resection and postoperative radiotherapy planning. • Intra-resection cavity pattern was associated with longer progression-free survival and overall survival in locally recurrent high-grade gliomas. • Higher vascular heterogeneities in extra-resection cavity recurrence than in intra-resection cavity recurrence and the vascular heterogeneity parameters had good diagnostic performance in discriminating spatial recurrence pattern. • A nomogram model based on MRI vascular habitats and clinical factors had good performance in predicting spatial recurrence pattern.",2196
37658888,MRI-based radiomic models to predict surgical margin status and infer tumor immune microenvironment in breast cancer patients with breast-conserving surgery: a multicenter validation study.,European radiology,2024,"Accurate preoperative estimation of the risk of breast-conserving surgery (BCS) resection margin positivity would be beneficial to surgical planning. In this multicenter validation study, we developed an MRI-based radiomic model to predict the surgical margin status. We retrospectively collected preoperative breast MRI of patients undergoing BCS from three hospitals (SYMH, n = 296; SYSUCC, n = 131; TSPH, n = 143). Radiomic-based model for risk prediction of the margin positivity was trained on the SYMH patients (7:3 ratio split for the training and testing cohorts), and externally validated in the SYSUCC and TSPH cohorts. The model was able to stratify patients into different subgroups with varied risk of margin positivity. Moreover, we used the immune-radiomic models and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) signature to infer the distribution patterns of immune cells and tumor cell EMT status under different marginal status. The AUCs of the radiomic-based model were 0.78 (0.66-0.90), 0.88 (0.79-0.96), and 0.76 (0.68-0.84) in the testing cohort and two external validation cohorts, respectively. The actual margin positivity rates ranged between 0-10% and 27.3-87.2% in low-risk and high-risk subgroups, respectively. Positive surgical margin was associated with higher levels of EMT and B cell infiltration in the tumor area, as well as the enrichment of B cells, immature dendritic cells, and neutrophil infiltration in the peritumoral area. This MRI-based predictive model can be used as a reliable tool to predict the risk of margin positivity of BCS. Tumor immune-microenvironment alteration was associated with surgical margin status. This study can assist the pre-operative planning of BCS. Further research on the tumor immune microenvironment of different resection margin states is expected to develop new margin evaluation indicators and decipher the internal mechanism. • The MRI-based radiomic prediction model (CSS model) incorporating features extracted from multiple sequences and segments could estimate the margin positivity risk of breast-conserving surgery. • The radiomic score of the CSS model allows risk stratification of patients undergoing breast-conserving surgery, which could assist in surgical planning. • With the help of MRI-based radiomics to estimate the components of the immune microenvironment, for the first time, it is found that the margin status of breast-conserving surgery is associated with the infiltration of immune cells in the microenvironment and the EMT status of breast tumor cells.",2552
37658885,Deep learning-based detection and quantification of brain metastases on black-blood imaging can provide treatment suggestions: a clinical cohort study.,European radiology,2024,"We aimed to evaluate whether deep learning-based detection and quantification of brain metastasis (BM) may suggest treatment options for patients with BMs. The deep learning system (DLS) for detection and quantification of BM was developed in 193 patients and applied to 112 patients that were newly detected on black-blood contrast-enhanced T1-weighted imaging. Patients were assigned to one of 3 treatment suggestion groups according to the European Association of Neuro-Oncology (EANO)-European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) recommendations using number and volume of the BMs detected by the DLS: short-term imaging follow-up without treatment (group A), surgery or stereotactic radiosurgery (limited BM, group B), or whole-brain radiotherapy or systemic chemotherapy (extensive BM, group C). The concordance between the DLS-based groups and clinical decisions was analyzed with or without consideration of targeted agents. The performance of distinguishing high-risk (B + C) was calculated. Among 112 patients (mean age 64.3 years, 63 men), group C had the largest number and volume of BM, followed by group B (4.4 and 851.6 mm DLS-based detection and quantification of BM have the potential to be helpful in the determination of treatment options for both low- and high-risk groups of limited and extensive BMs. For patients with newly diagnosed brain metastasis, deep learning-based detection and quantification may be used in clinical settings where prompt and accurate treatment decisions are required, which can lead to better patient outcomes. • Deep learning-based brain metastasis detection and quantification showed excellent agreement with ground-truth classifications. • By setting an algorithm to suggest treatment based on the number and volume of brain metastases detected by the deep learning system, the concordance was 81.3%. • When dividing patients into low- and high-risk groups, the sensitivity for detecting the latter was 95%.",1959
37658884,A radiomics-based interpretable model to predict the pathological grade of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors.,European radiology,2024,"To develop a computed tomography (CT) radiomics-based interpretable machine learning (ML) model to predict the pathological grade of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (pNETs) in a non-invasive manner. Patients with pNETs who underwent contrast-enhanced abdominal CT between 2010 and 2022 were included in this retrospective study. Radiomics features were extracted, and five radiomics-based ML models, namely logistic regression (LR), random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), XGBoost, and GaussianNB, were developed. The performance of these models was evaluated using a time-independent testing set, and metrics such as sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) were calculated. The accuracy of the radiomics model was compared to that of needle biopsy. The Shapley Additive Explanation (SHAP) tool and the correlation between radiomics and biological features were employed to explore the interpretability of the model. A total of 122 patients (mean age: 50 ± 14 years; 53 male) were included in the training set, whereas 100 patients (mean age: 48 ± 13 years; 50 male) were included in the testing set. The AUCs for LR, SVM, RF, XGBoost, and GaussianNB were 0.758, 0.742, 0.779, 0.744, and 0.745, respectively, with corresponding accuracies of 73.0%, 70.0%, 77.0%, 71.9%, and 72.9%. The SHAP tool identified two features of the venous phase as the most significant, which showed significant differences among the Ki-67 index or mitotic count subgroups (p < 0.001). An interpretable radiomics-based RF model can effectively differentiate between G1 and G2/3 of pNETs, demonstrating favorable interpretability. The radiomics-based interpretable model developed in this study has significant clinical relevance as it offers a non-invasive method for assessing the pathological grade of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors and holds promise as an important complementary tool to traditional tissue biopsy. • A radiomics-based interpretable model was developed to predict the pathological grade of pNETs and compared with preoperative needle biopsy in terms of accuracy. • The model, based on CT radiomics, demonstrated favorable interpretability. • The radiomics model holds potential as a valuable complementary technique to preoperative needle biopsy; however, it should not be considered a replacement for biopsy.",2383
37658883,A novel image deep learning-based sub-centimeter pulmonary nodule management algorithm to expedite resection of the malignant and avoid over-diagnosis of the benign.,European radiology,2024,"With the popularization of chest computed tomography (CT) screening, there are more sub-centimeter (≤ 1 cm) pulmonary nodules (SCPNs) requiring further diagnostic workup. This area represents an important opportunity to optimize the SCPN management algorithm avoiding ""one-size fits all"" approach. One critical problem is how to learn the discriminative multi-view characteristics and the unique context of each SCPN. Here, we propose a multi-view coupled self-attention module (MVCS) to capture the global spatial context of the CT image through modeling the association order of space and dimension. Compared with existing self-attention methods, MVCS uses less memory consumption and computational complexity, unearths dimension correlations that previous methods have not found, and is easy to integrate with other frameworks. In total, a public dataset LUNA16 from LIDC-IDRI, 1319 SCPNs from 1069 patients presenting to a major referral center, and 160 SCPNs from 137 patients from three other major centers were analyzed to pre-train, train, and validate the model. Experimental results showed that performance outperforms the state-of-the-art models in terms of accuracy and stability and is comparable to that of human experts in classifying precancerous lesions and invasive adenocarcinoma. We also provide a fusion MVCS network (MVCSN) by combining the CT image with the clinical characteristics and radiographic features of patients. This tool may ultimately aid in expediting resection of the malignant SCPNs and avoid over-diagnosis of the benign ones, resulting in improved management outcomes. In the diagnosis of sub-centimeter lung adenocarcinoma, fusion MVCSN can help doctors improve work efficiency and guide their treatment decisions to a certain extent. • Advances in computed tomography (CT) not only increase the number of nodules detected, but also the nodules that are identified are smaller, such as sub-centimeter pulmonary nodules (SCPNs). • We propose a multi-view coupled self-attention module (MVCS), which could model spatial and dimensional correlations sequentially for learning global spatial contexts, which is better than other attention mechanisms. • MVCS uses fewer huge memory consumption and computational complexity than the existing self-attention methods when dealing with 3D medical image data. Additionally, it reaches promising accuracy for SCPNs' malignancy evaluation and has lower training cost than other models.",2464
37658141,Localization of contrast-enhanced breast lesions in ultrafast screening MRI using deep convolutional neural networks.,European radiology,2024,"To develop a deep learning-based method for contrast-enhanced breast lesion detection in ultrafast screening MRI. A total of 837 breast MRI exams of 488 consecutive patients were included. Lesion's location was independently annotated in the maximum intensity projection (MIP) image of the last time-resolved angiography with stochastic trajectories (TWIST) sequence for each individual breast, resulting in 265 lesions (190 benign, 75 malignant) in 163 breasts (133 women). YOLOv5 models were fine-tuned using training sets containing the same number of MIP images with and without lesions. A long short-term memory (LSTM) network was employed to help reduce false positive predictions. The integrated system was then evaluated on test sets containing enriched uninvolved breasts during cross-validation to mimic the performance in a screening scenario. In five-fold cross-validation, the YOLOv5x model showed a sensitivity of 0.95, 0.97, 0.98, and 0.99, with 0.125, 0.25, 0.5, and 1 false positive per breast, respectively. The LSTM network reduced 15.5% of the false positive prediction from the YOLO model, and the positive predictive value was increased from 0.22 to 0.25. A fine-tuned YOLOv5x model can detect breast lesions on ultrafast MRI with high sensitivity in a screening population, and the output of the model could be further refined by an LSTM network to reduce the amount of false positive predictions. The proposed integrated system would make the ultrafast MRI screening process more effective by assisting radiologists in prioritizing suspicious examinations and supporting the diagnostic workup. • Deep convolutional neural networks could be utilized to automatically pinpoint breast lesions in screening MRI with high sensitivity. • False positive predictions significantly increased when the detection models were tested on highly unbalanced test sets with more normal scans. • Dynamic enhancement patterns of breast lesions during contrast inflow learned by the long short-term memory networks helped to reduce false positive predictions.",2063
37658139,MRI-based automated machine learning model for preoperative identification of variant histology in muscle-invasive bladder carcinoma.,European radiology,2024,"It is essential yet highly challenging to preoperatively diagnose variant histologies such as urothelial carcinoma with squamous differentiation (UC w/SD) from pure UC in patients with muscle-invasive bladder carcinoma (MIBC), as their treatment strategy varies significantly. We developed a non-invasive automated machine learning (AutoML) model to preoperatively differentiate UC w/SD from pure UC in patients with MIBC. A total of 119 MIBC patients who underwent baseline bladder MRI were enrolled in this study, including 38 patients with UC w/SD and 81 patients with pure UC. These patients were randomly assigned to a training set or a test set (3:1). An AutoML model was built from the training set, using 13 selected radiomic features from T2-weighted imaging, semantic features (ADC values), and clinical features (tumor length, tumor stage, lymph node metastasis status), and subsequent ten-fold cross-validation was performed. A test set was used to validate the proposed model. The AUC of the ROC curve was then calculated for the model. This AutoML model enabled robust differentiation of UC w/SD and pure UC in patients with MIBC in both training set (ten-fold cross-validation AUC = 0.955, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.944-0.965) and test set (AUC = 0.932, 95% CI: 0.812-1.000). The presented AutoML model, that incorporates the radiomic, semantic, and clinical features from baseline MRI, could be useful for preoperative differentiation of UC w/SD and pure UC. This MRI-based automated machine learning (AutoML) study provides a non-invasive and low-cost preoperative prediction tool to identify the muscle-invasive bladder cancer patients with variant histology, which may serve as a useful tool for clinical decision-making. • It is important to preoperatively diagnose variant histology from urothelial carcinoma in patients with muscle-invasive bladder carcinoma (MIBC), as their treatment strategy varies significantly. • An automated machine learning (AutoML) model based on baseline bladder MRI can identify the variant histology (squamous differentiation) from urothelial carcinoma preoperatively in patients with MIBC. • The developed AutoML model is a non-invasive and low-cost preoperative prediction tool, which may be useful for clinical decision-making.",2287
37656177,Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System version 2018 category 5 for diagnosing hepatocellular carcinoma: an updated meta-analysis.,European radiology,2024,"We performed an updated meta-analysis to determine the diagnostic performance of Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System (LI-RADS, LR) 5 category for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) using LI-RADS version 2018 (v2018), and to evaluate differences by imaging modalities and type of MRI contrast material. The MEDLINE and Embase databases were searched for studies reporting the performance of LR-5 using v2018 for diagnosing HCC. A bivariate random-effects model was used to calculate the pooled per-observation sensitivity and specificity. Subgroup analysis was performed based on imaging modalities and type of MRI contrast material. Forty-eight studies qualified for the meta-analysis, comprising 9031 patients, 10,547 observations, and 7216 HCCs. The pooled per-observation sensitivity and specificity of LR-5 for diagnosing HCC were 66% (95% CI, 61-70%) and 91% (95% CI, 89-93%), respectively. In the subgroup analysis, MRI with extracellular agent (ECA-MRI) showed significantly higher pooled sensitivity (77% [95% CI, 70-82%]) than CT (66% [95% CI, 58-73%]; p = 0.023) or MRI with gadoxetate (Gx-MRI) (65% [95% CI, 60-70%]; p = 0.001), but there was no significant difference between ECA-MRI and MRI with gadobenate (gadobenate-MRI) (73% [95% CI, 61-82%]; p = 0.495).

LI-RADS v2018 LR-5 provides high specificity for HCC diagnosis regardless of modality or contrast material, while ECA-MRI showed higher sensitivity than CT or Gx-MRI. Refinement of the criteria for improving sensitivity while maintaining high specificity of LR-5 for HCC diagnosis may be an essential future direction. • The pooled per-observation sensitivity and specificity of LR-5 for diagnosing HCC using LI-RADSv2018 were 66% and 91%, respectively. • ECA-MRI showed higher sensitivity than CT (77% vs 66%, p = 0.023) or Gx-MRI (77% vs 65%, p = 0.001). • LI-RADS v2018 LR-5 provides high specificity (88-93%) for HCC diagnosis regardless of modality or contrast material type.",2169
37656175,Improving radiomics reproducibility using deep learning-based image conversion of CT reconstruction algorithms in hepatocellular carcinoma patients.,European radiology,2024,"CT reconstruction algorithms affect radiomics reproducibility. In this study, we evaluate the effect of deep learning-based image conversion on CT reconstruction algorithms. This study included 78 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients who underwent four-phase liver CTs comprising non-contrast, late arterial (LAP), portal venous (PVP), and delayed phase (DP), reconstructed using both filtered back projection (FBP) and advanced modeled iterative reconstruction (ADMIRE). PVP images were used to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) model to convert images from FBP to ADMIRE and vice versa. LAP, PVP, and DP images were used for validation and testing. Radiomic features were extracted for each patient with a semi-automatic segmentation tool. We used concordance correlation coefficients (CCCs) to evaluate the radiomics reproducibility for original FBP (oFBP) vs. original ADMIRE (oADMIRE), oFBP vs. converted FBP (cFBP), and oADMIRE vs. converted ADMIRE (cADMIRE). In the test group including 30 patients, the CCC and proportion of reproducible features (CCC ≥ 0.85) for oFBP vs. oADMIRE were 0.65 and 32.9% (524/1595) for LAP, 0.65 and 35.9% (573/1595) for PVP, and 0.69 and 43.8% (699/1595) for DP. For oFBP vs. cFBP, the values increased to 0.92 and 83.9% (1339/1595) for LAP, 0.89 and 71.0% (1133/1595) for PVP, and 0.90 and 79.7% (1271/1595) for DP. Similarly, for oADMIRE vs. cADMIRE, the values increased to 0.87 and 68.1% (1086/1595) for LAP, 0.91 and 82.1% (1309/1595) for PVP, and 0.89 and 76.2% (1216/1595) for DP. CNN-based image conversion between CT reconstruction algorithms improved the radiomics reproducibility of HCCs. This study demonstrates that using a CNN-based image conversion technique significantly improves the reproducibility of radiomic features in HCCs, highlighting its potential for enhancing radiomics research in HCC patients. Radiomics reproducibility of HCC was improved via CNN-based image conversion between two different CT reconstruction algorithms. This is the first clinical study to demonstrate improvements across a range of radiomic features in HCC patients.

37656174,CT-guided microcoil localization of pulmonary nodules before VATS: clinical experience in 1059 patients.,European radiology,2024,"To retrospectively evaluate the efficacy and safety of CT-guided microcoil localization of pulmonary nodules before video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS). A total of 1059 consecutive patients with 1331 pulmonary nodules treated between July 2018 and April 2021 were included in this study. Of the 1331 nodules, 1318 were localized using the tailed method and 13 were localized using the non-tailed method. The localization technical success rate and complications of the microcoil localization procedure were assessed. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to determine potential risk factors for technical failure, pneumothorax, and pulmonary hemorrhage. The technical success rate of the localization procedure was 98.4% (1310/1331 nodules). Nodule location in the lower lobes (p = 0.015) and need for a longer needle path (p < 0.001) were independent predictors of technical failure. All localization procedure-related complications were minor (grade 1 or 2) adverse events, with the exception of one grade 3 complication. The most common complications were pneumothorax (302/1331 nodules [22.7%]) and pulmonary hemorrhage (328/1331 nodules [24.6%]). Male sex (p = 0.001), nodule location in the middle (p = 0.003) and lower lobes (p = 0.025), need for a longer needle path (p < 0.001), use of transfissural puncture (p = 0.042), and simultaneous multiple localizations (p < 0.001) were independent risk factors for pneumothorax. Female sex (p = 0.015), younger age (p = 0.023), nodules location in the upper lobes (p = 0.011), and longer needle path (p < 0.001) were independent risk factors for pulmonary hemorrhage. CT-guided microcoil localization of pulmonary nodules before VATS using either the tailed or non-tailed method is effective and safe. CT-guided microcoil localization of pulmonary nodules before VATS resection is effective and safe when using either the tailed or non-tailed method. Nodules requiring transfissural puncture and multiple nodules requiring simultaneous localizations can also be successfully localized with this method. • Pre-VATS CT-guided microcoil localization of pulmonary nodules by tailed or non-tailed method was effective and safe. • When the feasible puncture path was beyond the scope of wedge resection, localization could be performed using the non-tailed method. • Although transfissural puncture and simultaneous multiple localization were independent risk factors for pneumothorax, they remained clinically feasible.",2503

We aimed to clarify the existing evidence through a single-center, retrospective cohort study and to quantitatively summarize the body of literature by conducting a meta-analysis. In a retrospective cohort study, patients with clinical stage I lung adenocarcinoma were identified, and the prognostic value of ground-glass opacity was analyzed using multivariable Cox regression. Commercial artificial intelligence software was adopted as the second reader for the presence of ground-glass opacity. The primary end points were freedom from recurrence (FFR) and lung cancer-specific survival (LCSS). In a meta-analysis, we systematically searched Embase and OVID-MEDLINE up to December 30, 2021, for the studies based on the eighth-edition staging system. The pooled hazard ratios (HRs) of solid nodules (i.e., absence of ground-glass opacity) for various end points were calculated with a multi-level random effects model. In a cohort of 612 patients, solid nodules were associated with worse outcomes for FFR (adjusted HR, 1.98; 95% CI: 1.17-3.51; p = 0.01) and LCSS (adjusted HR, 1.937; 95% CI: 1.002-4.065; p = 0.049). The artificial intelligence assessment and multiple sensitivity analyses revealed consistent results. The meta-analysis included 13 studies with 12,080 patients. The pooled HR of solid nodules was 2.13 (95% CI: 1.69-2.67; I The absence of ground-glass opacity in early-stage lung adenocarcinomas is associated with worse postoperative survival. Early-stage lung adenocarcinomas manifesting as solid nodules at preoperative chest CT, which indicates the absence of ground-glass opacity, were associated with poor postoperative survival. There is room for improvement of the clinical T categorization in the next edition staging system. • In a retrospective study of 612 patients with stage I lung adenocarcinoma, solid nodules were associated with shorter freedom from recurrence (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 1.98; p = 0.01) and lung cancer-specific survival (adjusted HR, 1.937; p = 0.049). • Artificial intelligence-assessed solid nodules also showed worse prognosis (adjusted HR for freedom from recurrence, 1.94 [p = 0.01]; adjusted HR for lung cancer-specific survival, 1.93 [p = 0.04]). • In meta-analyses, the solid nodules were associated with shorter freedom from recurrence (HR, 2.45) and shorter overall survival (HR, 2.13).",2490
37650968,Impact of ultra-high-resolution imaging of the lungs on perceived diagnostic image quality using photon-counting CT.,European radiology,2024,"To compare clinical image quality and perceived impact on diagnostic interpretation of chest CT findings between ultra-high-resolution photon-counting CT (UHR-PCCT) and conventional high-resolution energy-integrating-detector CT (HR-EIDCT) using visual grading analysis (VGA) scores. Fifty patients who underwent a UHR-PCCT (matrix 512 × 512, 768 × 768, or 1024 × 1024; FOV average 275 × 376 mm, 120 × 0.2 mm; focal spot size 0.6 × 0.7 mm) between November 2021 and February 2022 and with a previous HR-EIDCT within the last 14 months were included. Four readers evaluated central and peripheral airways, lung vasculature, nodules, ground glass opacities, inter- and intralobular lines, emphysema, fissures, bullae/cysts, and air trapping on PCCT (0.4 mm) and conventional EIDCT (1 mm) via side-by-side reference scoring using a 5-point diagnostic quality score. The median VGA scores were compared and tested using one-sample Wilcoxon signed rank tests with hypothesized median values of 0 (same visibility) and 2 (better visibility on PCCT with impact on diagnostic interpretation) at a 2.5% significance level. Almost all lung structures had significantly better visibility on PCCT compared to EIDCT (p < 0.025; exception for ground glass nodules (N = 2/50 patients, p = 0.157)), with the highest scores seen for peripheral airways, micronodules, inter- and intralobular lines, and centrilobular emphysema (mean VGA > 1). Although better visibility, a perceived difference in diagnostic interpretation could not be demonstrated, since the median VGA was significantly different from 2. UHR-PCCT showed superior visibility compared to HR-EIDCT for central and peripheral airways, lung vasculature, fissures, ground glass opacities, macro- and micronodules, inter- and intralobular lines, paraseptal and centrilobular emphysema, bullae/cysts, and air trapping. UHR-PCCT has emerged as a promising technique for thoracic imaging, offering improved spatial resolution and lower radiation dose. Implementing PCCT into daily practice may allow better visibility of multiple lung structures and optimization of scan protocols for specific pathology. • The aim of this study was to verify if the higher spatial resolution of UHR-PCCT would improve the visibility and detection of certain lung structures and abnormalities. • UHR-PCCT was judged to have superior clinical image quality compared to conventional HR-EIDCT in the evaluation of the lungs. UHR-PCCT showed better visibility for almost all tested lung structures (except for ground glass nodules). • Despite superior image quality, the readers perceived no significant impact on the diagnostic interpretation of the studied lung structures and abnormalities.",2713

This study aims to evaluate PI-RR's diagnostic accuracy, assess the inter-observer reliability among readers with variable experience, and correlate imaging results with anatomopathological and laboratory parameters. Patients who underwent a pelvic MRI for suspicion of PCa local recurrence after RP or RT were retrospectively enrolled (October 2017-February 2020). PI-RR scores were independently assessed for each patient by five readers with variable experience in prostate MRI (two senior and three junior radiologists). Biochemical data and histopathological features were collected. The reference standard was determined through biochemical, imaging, or histopathological follow-up data. Reader's diagnostic performance was assessed using contingency tables. Cohen's kappa coefficient (κ) and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) were calculated to measure inter-observer reliability. The final cohort included 120 patients (median age, 72 years [IQR, 62-82]). Recurrence was confirmed in 106 (88.3%) patients. Considering a PI-RR score ≥ 3 as positive for recurrence, minimum and maximum diagnostic values among the readers were as follows: sensitivity 79-86%; specificity 64-86%; positive predictive value 95-98%; negative predictive value 33-46%; accuracy 79-87%. Regardless of reader's level of experience, the inter-observer reliability resulted good or excellent (κ ranges across all readers: 0.52-0.77), and ICC was 0.8. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) velocity, baseline-PSA, and trigger-PSA resulted predictive of local recurrence at imaging. The PI-RR system is an effective tool for MRI evaluation of PCa local recurrence and facilitates uniformity among radiologists. This study confirmed the PI-RR system's good diagnostic accuracy for the MRI evaluation of PCa local recurrences. It showed high reproducibility among readers with variable experience levels, validating it as a promising standardisation tool for assessing patients with biochemical recurrence. • In this retrospective study, the PI-RR system revealed promising diagnostic performances among five readers with different experience (sensitivity 79-86%; specificity 64-86%; accuracy 79-87%). • The inter-observer reliability among the five readers resulted good or excellent (κ ranges: 0.52-0.77) with an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.8. • The PI-RR assessment score may facilitate standardisation and generalizability in the evaluation of prostate cancer local recurrence among radiologists.",2728
37646814,Breast density and the likelihood of malignant MRI-detected lesions in women diagnosed with breast cancer.,European radiology,2023,"To assess whether mammographic breast density in women diagnosed with breast cancer correlates with the total number of incidental magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-detected lesions and the likelihood of the lesions being malignant. Patients diagnosed with breast cancer meeting the EUSOBI and EUSOMA criteria for preoperative breast MRI routinely undergo mammography and ultrasound before MRI at our institution. Incidental suspicious breast lesions detected in MRI are biopsied. We included patients diagnosed with invasive breast cancers between 2014 and 2019 who underwent preoperative breast MRI. One reader retrospectively determined breast density categories according to the 5 Of 946 patients with 973 malignant primary breast tumors, 166 (17.5%) had a total of 175 (18.0%) incidental MRI-detected lesions (82 (46.9%) malignant and 93 (53.1%) benign). High breast density according to BI-RADS was associated with higher incidence of all incidental enhancing lesions in preoperative breast MRIs: 2.66 (95% confidence interval: 1.03-6.86) higher for BI-RADS density category B, 2.68 (1.04-6.92) for category C, and 3.67 (1.36-9.93) for category D compared to category A (p < 0.05). However, high breast density did not predict higher incidence of malignant incidental lesions (p = 0.741). Incidental MRI-detected lesions in the contralateral breast were more likely benign (p < 0.001): 18 (27.3%)/48 (72.7%) vs. 64 (58.7%)/45 (41.3%) malignant/benign incidental lesions in contralateral vs. ipsilateral breasts. Women diagnosed with breast cancer who have dense breasts have more incidental MRI-detected lesions, but higher breast density does not translate to increased likelihood of malignant incidental lesions. Dense breasts should not be considered as an indication for preoperative breast MRI in women diagnosed with breast cancer. • The role of preoperative MRI of patients with dense breasts diagnosed with breast cancer is under debate. • Women with denser breasts have a higher incidence of all MRI-detected incidental breast lesions, but the incidence of malignant MRI-detected incidental lesions is not higher than in women with fatty breasts. • High breast density alone should not indicate preoperative breast MRI.",2233
37646809,Performance of Lung-RADS in different target populations: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,European radiology,2024,"Multiple lung cancer screening studies reported the performance of Lung CT Screening Reporting and Data System (Lung-RADS), but none systematically evaluated its performance across different populations. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the performance of Lung-RADS (versions 1.0 and 1.1) for detecting lung cancer in different populations. We performed literature searches in PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and Embase databases on October 21, 2022, for studies that evaluated the accuracy of Lung-RADS in lung cancer screening. A bivariate random-effects model was used to estimate pooled sensitivity and specificity, and heterogeneity was explored in stratified and meta-regression analyses. A total of 31 studies with 104,224 participants were included. For version 1.0 (27 studies, 95,413 individuals), pooled sensitivity was 0.96 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.90-0.99) and pooled specificity was 0.90 (95% CI: 0.87-0.92). Studies in high-risk populations showed higher sensitivity (0.98 [95% CI: 0.92-0.99] vs. 0.84 [95% CI: 0.50-0.96]) and lower specificity (0.87 [95% CI: 0.85-0.88] vs. 0.95 (95% CI: 0.92-0.97]) than studies in general populations. Non-Asian studies tended toward higher sensitivity (0.97 [95% CI: 0.91-0.99] vs. 0.91 [95% CI: 0.67-0.98]) and lower specificity (0.88 [95% CI: 0.85-0.90] vs. 0.93 [95% CI: 0.88-0.96]) than Asian studies. For version 1.1 (4 studies, 8811 individuals), pooled sensitivity was 0.91 (95% CI: 0.83-0.96) and specificity was 0.81 (95% CI: 0.67-0.90). Among studies using Lung-RADS version 1.0, considerable heterogeneity in sensitivity and specificity was noted, explained by population type (high risk vs. general), population area (Asia vs. non-Asia), and cancer prevalence. Meta-regression of lung cancer screening studies using Lung-RADS version 1.0 showed considerable heterogeneity in sensitivity and specificity, explained by the different target populations, including high-risk versus general populations, Asian versus non-Asian populations, and populations with different lung cancer prevalence. • High-risk population studies showed higher sensitivity and lower specificity compared with studies performed in general populations by using Lung-RADS version 1.0. • In non-Asian studies, the diagnostic performance of Lung-RADS version 1.0 tended to be better than in Asian studies. • There are limited studies on the performance of Lung-RADS version 1.1, and evidence is lacking for Asian populations.",2502
37646807,Outcomes and potential impact of a virtual hands-on training program on MRI staging confidence and performance in rectal cancer.,European radiology,2024,"To explore the potential impact of a dedicated virtual training course on MRI staging confidence and performance in rectal cancer. Forty-two radiologists completed a stepwise virtual training course on rectal cancer MRI staging composed of a pre-course (baseline) test with 7 test cases (5 staging, 2 restaging), a 1-day online workshop, 1 month of individual case readings (n = 70 cases with online feedback), a live online feedback session supervised by two expert faculty members, and a post-course test. The ESGAR structured reporting templates for (re)staging were used throughout the course. Results of the pre-course and post-course test were compared in terms of group interobserver agreement (Krippendorf's alpha), staging confidence (perceived staging difficulty), and diagnostic accuracy (using an expert reference standard). Though results were largely not statistically significant, the majority of staging variables showed a mild increase in diagnostic accuracy after the course, ranging between + 2% and + 17%. A similar trend was observed for IOA which improved for nearly all variables when comparing the pre- and post-course. There was a significant decrease in the perceived difficulty level (p = 0.03), indicating an improved diagnostic confidence after completion of the course. Though exploratory in nature, our study results suggest that use of a dedicated virtual training course and web platform has potential to enhance staging performance, confidence, and interobserver agreement to assess rectal cancer on MRI virtual training and could thus be a good alternative (or addition) to in-person training. Rectal cancer MRI reporting quality is highly dependent on radiologists' expertise, stressing the need for dedicated training/teaching. This study shows promising results for a virtual web-based training program, which could be a good alternative (or addition) to in-person training. • Rectal cancer MRI reporting quality is highly dependent on radiologists' expertise, stressing the need for dedicated training and teaching. • Using a dedicated virtual training course and web-based platform, encouraging first results were achieved to improve staging accuracy, diagnostic confidence, and interobserver agreement. • These exploratory results suggest that virtual training could thus be a good alternative (or addition) to in-person training.",2371
37644151,"Evaluation of standard breast ultrasonography by adding two-dimensional and three-dimensional shear wave elastography: a prospective, multicenter trial.",European radiology,2024,"To reduce the number of biopsies performed on benign breast lesions categorized as BI-RADS 4-5, we investigated the diagnostic performance of combined two-dimensional and three-dimensional shear wave elastography (2D + 3D SWE) with standard breast ultrasonography (US) for the BI-RADS assessment of breast lesions. A total of 897 breast lesions, categorized as BI-RADS 3-5, were subjected to standard breast US and supplemented by 2D SWE only and 2D + 3D SWE analysis. Based on the malignancy rate of less than 2% for BI-RADS 3, lesions assessed by standard breast US were reclassified with SWE assessment. After standard breast US evaluation, 268 (46.1%) participants underwent benign biopsies in BI-RADS 4-5 lesions. By using separated cutoffs for upstaging BI-RADS 3 at 120 kPa and downstaging BI-RADS 4a at 90 kPa in 2D + 3D SWE reclassification, 123 (21.2%) participants underwent benign biopsy, resulting in a 54.1% reduction (123 versus 268). Combining 2D + 3D SWE with standard breast US for reclassification of BI-RADS lesions may achieve a reduction in benign biopsies in BI-RADS 4-5 lesions without sacrificing sensitivity unacceptably. Combining 2D + 3D SWE with US effectively reduces benign biopsies in breast lesions with categories 4-5, potentially improving diagnostic accuracy of BI-RADS assessment for patients with breast lesions. ChiCTR1900026556 KEY POINTS: • Reduce benign biopsy is necessary in breast lesions with BI-RADS 4-5 category. • A reduction of 54.1% on benign biopsies in BI-RADS 4-5 lesions was achieved using 2D + 3D SWE reclassification. • Adding 2D + 3D SWE to standard breast US improved the diagnostic performance of BI-RADS assessment on breast lesions: specificity increased from 54 to 79%, and PPV increased from 54 to 71%, with slight loss in sensitivity (97.2% versus 98.7%) and NPV (98.1% versus 98.7%).",1849

Biopsy to identify proliferative HCC is not routinely performed before cTACE. Purpose To develop and validate a predictive model for identifying proliferative HCCs using CT imaging features and to compare therapeutic outcomes between predicted proliferative and nonproliferative HCCs after cTACE according to this model. Materials and Methods This retrospective multicenter study included adults with HCC who underwent liver resection or cTACE between August 2013 and December 2020. A CT-based predictive model for identifying proliferative HCCs was developed and externally validated in a cohort that underwent resection. Diagnostic performance was calculated for the model. Thereafter, patients in the cTACE cohort were stratified into groups with predicted proliferative or nonproliferative HCCs according to the model. The primary outcome was overall survival (OS), and the secondary outcomes were tumor response rate and progression-free survival (PFS).

37642571,Assessing Breast Cancer Risk by Combining AI for Lesion Detection and Mammographic Texture.,Radiology,2023,"Background Recent mammography-based risk models can estimate short-term or long-term breast cancer risk, but whether risk assessment may improve by combining these models has not been evaluated. Purpose To determine whether breast cancer risk assessment improves when combining a diagnostic artificial intelligence (AI) system for lesion detection and a mammographic texture model. Materials and Methods This retrospective study included Danish women consecutively screened for breast cancer at mammography from November 2012 to December 2015 who had at least 5 years of follow-up data. Examinations were evaluated for short-term risk using a commercially available diagnostic AI system for lesion detection, which produced a score to indicate the probability of cancer. A mammographic texture model, trained on a separate data set, assessed textures associated with long-term cancer risk. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) analysis was used to evaluate both the individual and combined performance of the AI and texture models for the prediction of future cancers in women with a negative screening mammogram, including those with interval cancers diagnosed within 2 years of screening and long-term cancers diagnosed 2 years or more after screening. AUCs were compared using the DeLong test. Results The Danish screening cohort included 119 650 women (median age, 59 years [IQR, 53-64 years]), of whom 320 developed interval cancers and 1401 developed long-term cancers. The combination model achieved a higher AUC for interval and long-term cancers grouped together than either the diagnostic AI (AUC, 0.73 vs 0.70; ",1646

The proposed CT-based nomogram, based on easily available CT features, may serve as an effective and convenient tool for stratifying further the recurrence risk of patients with pancreatic body/tail adenocarcinoma. • The CT-based nomogram, incorporating five commonly used CT features, successfully preoperatively stratified patients with resectable PBTA into distinct prognosis groups. • Tumor density in the venous phase, tumor necrosis, splenic vein invasion, adjacent organ invasion, and superior mesenteric vein/portal vein abutment were associated with RFS in patients with resectable PBTA. • The CT-based nomogram exhibited better predictive performance for recurrence than the 8",1962
37624414,Reliability and practicability of PSMA-RADS 1.0 for structured reporting of PSMA-PET/CT scans in prostate cancer patients.,European radiology,2024,"As structured reporting is increasingly used in the evaluation of prostate-specific membrane antigen positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PSMA-PET/CT) for prostate cancer, there is a need to assess the reliability of these frameworks. This study aimed to evaluate the intra- and interreader agreement among readers with varying levels of experience using PSMA-RADS 1.0 for interpreting PSMA-PET/CT scans, even when blinded to clinical data, and therefore to determine the feasibility of implementing this reporting system in clinical practice. PSMA-PET/CT scans of 103 patients were independently evaluated by 4 readers with different levels of experience according to the reporting and data system (RADS) for PSMA-PET/CT imaging PSMA-RADS 1.0 at 2 time points within 6 weeks. For each scan, a maximum of five target lesions were freely chosen and stratified according to PSMA-RADS 1.0. Overall scan score and compartment-based scores were assessed. Intra- and interreader agreement was determined using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). PSMA-RADS 1.0 demonstrated excellent interreader agreement for both overall scan scores (ICC ≥ 0.91) and compartment-based scores (ICC ≥ 0.93) across all four readers. The framework showed excellent intrareader agreement for overall scan scores (ICC ≥ 0.86) and compartment-based scores (ICC ≥ 0.95), even among readers with varying levels of experience. PSMA-RADS 1.0 is a reliable method for assessing PSMA-PET/CT with strong consistency and agreement among readers. It shows great potential for establishing a standard approach to diagnosing and planning treatment for prostate cancer patients, and can be used confidently even by readers with less experience. This study underlines that PSMA-RADS 1.0 is a valuable and highly reliable scoring system for PSMA-PET/CT scans of prostate cancer patients and can be used confidently by radiologists with different levels of experience in routine clinical practice. PSMA-RADS version 1.0 is a scoring system for PSMA-PET/CT scans. Its reproducibility needs to be analyzed in order to make it applicable to clinical practice. Excellent interreader and intrareader agreement for overall scan scores and compartment-based scores using PSMA-RADS 1.0 were seen in readers with varying levels of experience.

We aimed to develop an nnU-Net-based deep learning model for automated brain extraction on contrast-enhanced T1-weighted (T1CE) images in presence of brain tumors. This is a multi-center, retrospective study involving 920 patients. A total of 720 cases with four types of intracranial tumors from private institutions were collected and set as the training group and the internal test group. Mann-Whitney U test (U test) was used to investigate if the model performance was associated with pathological types and tumor characteristics. Then, the generalization of model was independently tested on public datasets consisting of 100 glioma and 100 vestibular schwannoma cases. In the internal test, the model achieved promising performance with median Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 0.989 (interquartile range (IQR), 0.988-0.991), and Hausdorff distance (HD) of 6.403 mm (IQR, 5.099-8.426 mm). U test suggested a slightly descending performance in meningioma and vestibular schwannoma group. The results of U test also suggested that there was a significant difference in peritumoral edema group, with median DSC of 0.990 (IQR, 0.989-0.991, p = 0.002), and median HD of 5.916 mm (IQR, 5.000-8.000 mm, p = 0.049).

We searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science to identify relevant studies and used the QUADAS-2 tool to assess methodological quality of eligible studies. We used STATA version 12.0 to perform data pooling, heterogeneity testing, subgroup analysis, and sensitivity analysis. For the 21 enrolled studies, including 2875 patients, the pooled sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio, negative likelihood ratio, and diagnostic odds ratio were respectively 0.63 (95% CI: 0.53-0.72), 0.75 (95% CI: 0.68-0.81), 2.52 (95% CI: 1.98-3.19), 0.50 (95% CI: 0.39-0.63), and 5.08 (95% CI: 3.38-7.63). The AUC was 0.76 (95% CI: 0.72-0.79). I MRI may have suboptimal diagnostic value in assessing ALNS after NAC for breast cancer patients. Due to the inconsistency of NAC regimens, the variability of axillary surgery, and the lack of time interval between MRI and surgery, further studies are needed to confirm our findings. Our study provided the diagnostic value of MRI in assessing axillary lymph node status after neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer patients. • MRI may have suboptimal diagnostic value in assessing axillary lymph node status after NAC for general breast cancer patients. • The initial axillary lymph node status has little impact on the diagnostic efficacy of MRI. • The substantial heterogeneity among studies highlights the need for further studies to provide more high-quality evidence in this field.",1655

We retrospectively included 194 consecutive patients who underwent surgical resection of pancreatic IPMNs between January 2008 and December 2020. Surgical histopathology was the reference standard for diagnosing malignancy. Using radiomics features from preoperative contrast-enhanced CT, a radiomics model was built with the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator by a five-fold cross-validation. CT and MR images were independently reviewed based on the 2017 ICGs by two abdominal radiologists, and the performances of the 2017 ICGs and radiomics model were compared. The areas under the curve (AUCs) were compared using the DeLong method. A total of 194 patients with pancreatic IPMNs (benign, 83 [43%]; malignant, 111 [57%]) were chronologically divided into training (n = 141; age, 65 ± 8.6 years; 88 males) and validation sets (n = 53; age, 66 ± 9.7 years; 31 males). There was no statistically significant difference in the diagnostic performance of the 2017 ICGs between CT and MRI (AUC, 0.71 vs. 0.71; p = 0.93) with excellent intermodality agreement (k = 0.86).

37615761,Correlation of gene expression with magnetic resonance imaging features of retinoblastoma: a multi-center radiogenomics validation study.,European radiology,2024,"To validate associations between MRI features and gene expression profiles in retinoblastoma, thereby evaluating the repeatability of radiogenomics in retinoblastoma. In this retrospective multicenter cohort study, retinoblastoma patients with gene expression data and MRI were included. MRI features (scored blinded for clinical data) and matched genome-wide gene expression data were used to perform radiogenomic analysis. Expression data from each center were first separately processed and analyzed. The end product normalized expression values from different sites were subsequently merged by their Z-score to permit cross-sites validation analysis. The MRI features were non-parametrically correlated with expression of photoreceptorness (radiogenomic analysis), a gene expression signature informing on disease progression. Outcomes were compared to outcomes in a previous described cohort. Thirty-six retinoblastoma patients were included, 15 were female (42%), and mean age was 24 (SD 18) months. Similar to the prior evaluation, this validation study showed that low photoreceptorness gene expression was associated with advanced stage imaging features. Validated imaging features associated with low photoreceptorness were multifocality, a tumor encompassing the entire retina or entire globe, and a diffuse growth pattern (all p < 0.05). There were a number of radiogenomic associations that were also not validated. A part of the radiogenomic associations could not be validated, underlining the importance of validation studies. Nevertheless, cross-center validation of imaging features associated with photoreceptorness gene expression highlighted the capability radiogenomics to non-invasively inform on molecular subtypes in retinoblastoma. Radiogenomics may serve as a surrogate for molecular subtyping based on histopathology material in an era of eye-sparing retinoblastoma treatment strategies. • Since retinoblastoma is increasingly treated using eye-sparing methods, MRI features informing on molecular subtypes that do not rely on histopathology material are important. • A part of the associations between retinoblastoma MRI features and gene expression profiles (radiogenomics) were validated. • Radiogenomics could be a non-invasive technique providing information on the molecular make-up of retinoblastoma.",2335

Thirty-six bone-only mCRPC patients were prospectively recruited from three centers. Whole-body (WB)-MRI with DWI and 18F-NaF and 18F-choline PET/CT were performed at therapy baseline and 8-week intervals. In each patient, bone disease median global (g)ADC change between baseline and follow-up was calculated. Additionally, up to five bone target lesions per patient were delineated and individual median ADC change recorded. An ADC increase > 30% defined response per-patient and per-lesion. For the same targets, baseline 18F-NaF and 18F-choline PET SUVmax were recorded. Mean SUVmax across patient targets was correlated with gADC change and lesion SUVmax with per-lesion ADC change. A total of 133 lesions in 36 patients (14 responders) were analyzed. 18F-NaF PET per-patient mean SUVmax was significantly higher in responders (median = 56.0 versus 38.7 in non-responders; p = 0.008), with positive correlation between SUVmax and gADC increase (rho = 0.42; p = 0.015). A 48.7 SUVmax threshold identified responders with 77% sensitivity and 75% specificity.

A total of 460 patients with IB to IIB cervical AC and ASC who underwent preoperative MRI examination and radical trachelectomy/hysterectomy were retrospectively enrolled and divided into primary, internal validation, and external validation cohorts. The original (Ori) and wavelet (Wav)-transform features were extracted from the volumetric region of interest of the tumour (ROI-T) and 3mm- and 5mm-peritumoral rings (ROI-3 and ROI-5), respectively. Then the Ori and Ori-Wav feature-based radiomics signatures from the tumour (RST) and 3 mm- and 5 mm-peritumoral regions (RS3 and RS5) were independently built and their diagnostic performances were compared to select the optimal ones. Finally, the nomogram was developed by integrating optimal intra- and peritumoral signatures and clinical independent risk factors based on multivariable logistic regression analysis. FIGO stage, disruption of the cervical stromal ring on MRI (DCSRMR), parametrial invasion on MRI (PMIMR), and serum CA-125 were identified as independent risk factors. The nomogram constructed by integrating independent risk factors, Ori-Wav feature-based RST, and RS5 yielded AUCs of 0.874 (0.810-0.922), 0.885 (0.834-0.924), and 0.966 (0.887-0.995) for predicting PMI in the primary, internal and external validation cohorts, respectively. Furthermore, the nomogram was superior to radiomics signatures and clinical model for predicting PMI in three cohorts. The nomogram can preoperatively, accurately, and noninvasively predict PMI in patients with early-stage cervical AC and ASC. The nomogram can preoperatively, accurately, and noninvasively predict PMI and facilitate precise treatment decisions regarding chemoradiotherapy or radical hysterectomy in patients with early-stage cervical AC and ASC.

A multi-feature fusion network combining low-energy (LE) and dual-energy subtracted (DES) images and dual view, as well as bilateral information, was trained and tested using a large CEM dataset with a diversity of breast tumors for breast lesion classification. Its generalization performance was further evaluated on two external datasets. Results were reported using AUC, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. A total of 2496 patients (mean age, 53 years ± 12 (standard deviation)) were included and divided into a training set (1718), a validation set (255), and a testing set (523). The proposed CEM-based multi-feature fusion network achieved the best diagnosis performance with an AUC of 0.96 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.95, 0.97), compared with the no-fusion model, the left-right fusion model, and the multi-feature fusion network with only LE image inputs. Our models reached an AUC of 0.90 (95% CI: 0.85, 0.94) on a full-field digital mammograph (FFDM) external dataset (86 patients), and an AUC of 0.92 (95% CI: 0.89, 0.95) on a CEM external dataset (193 patients). The developed multi-feature fusion neural network achieved high performance in CEM image classification and was able to facilitate CEM-based breast cancer diagnosis. Compared with low-energy images, CEM images have greater sensitivity and similar specificity in malignant breast lesion detection. The multi-feature fusion neural network is a promising computer-aided diagnostic tool for the clinical diagnosis of breast cancer. • Deep convolutional neural networks have the potential to facilitate contrast-enhanced mammography-based breast cancer diagnosis. • The multi-feature fusion neural network reaches high accuracies in the classification of contrast-enhanced mammography images. • The developed model is a promising diagnostic tool to facilitate clinical breast cancer diagnosis.",2170

Radiologic features were visually analyzed and combined with clinical information to establish a clinical-radiologic model. Deep learning (DL) radiomics models were based on DL features and handcrafted features extracted from virtual monoenergetic images and material composition images on dual phase using binary least absolute shrinkage and selection operators. A DL radiomics nomogram was developed using multivariable logistic regression analysis. Model performance was evaluated with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), and the log-rank test was used to analyze recurrence-free survival. Results A total of 262 patients were included (mean age, 54 years ± 12 [SD]; 225 men [86%]; training data set, ",1398
37597033,Noninvasive identification of HER2-low-positive status by MRI-based deep learning radiomics predicts the disease-free survival of patients with breast cancer.,European radiology,2024,"This study aimed to establish a MRI-based deep learning radiomics (DLR) signature to predict the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-low-positive status and further verified the difference in prognosis by the DLR model. A total of 481 patients with breast cancer who underwent preoperative MRI were retrospectively recruited from two institutions. Traditional radiomics features and deep semantic segmentation feature-based radiomics (DSFR) features were extracted from segmented tumors to construct models separately. Then, the DLR model was constructed to assess the HER2 status by averaging the output probabilities of the two models. Finally, a Kaplan‒Meier survival analysis was conducted to explore the disease-free survival (DFS) in patients with HER2-low-positive status. The multivariate Cox proportional hazard model was constructed to further determine the factors associated with DFS. First, the DLR model distinguished between HER2-negative and HER2-overexpressing patients with AUCs of 0.868 and 0.763 in the training and validation cohorts, respectively. Furthermore, the DLR model distinguished between HER2-low-positive and HER2-zero patients with AUCs of 0.855 and 0.750, respectively. Cox regression analysis showed that the prediction score obtained using the DLR model (HR, 0.175; p = 0.024) and lesion size (HR, 1.043; p = 0.009) were significant, independent predictors of DFS. We successfully constructed a DLR model based on MRI to noninvasively evaluate the HER2 status and further revealed prospects for predicting the DFS of patients with HER2-low-positive status. The MRI-based DLR model could noninvasively identify HER2-low-positive status, which is considered a novel prognostic predictor and therapeutic target. • The DLR model effectively distinguished the HER2 status of breast cancer patients, especially the HER2-low-positive status. • The DLR model was better than the traditional radiomics model or DSFR model in distinguishing HER2 expression. • The prediction score obtained using the model and lesion size were significant independent predictors of DFS.",2107
37594526,A contrast-enhanced CT radiomics-based model to identify candidates for deintensified chemoradiotherapy in locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients.,European radiology,2024,"To develop a contrast-enhanced CT (CECT) radiomics-based model to identify locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma (LA-NPC) patients who would benefit from deintensified chemoradiotherapy. LA-NPC patients who received low-dose concurrent cisplatin therapy (cumulative: 150 mg/m Training and validation groups consisted of 66 and 33 patients, respectively. Three significant independent radiomics features (flatness, mean, and gray level non-uniformity in gray level dependence matrix (GLDM-GLN)) were found. The radiomics score showed better predictive ability than the T stage (concordance index (C-index): 0.67 vs. 0.61, AUC: 0.75 vs. 0.60). The R + N model had better predictive performance and more effective risk stratification than the T + N model (C-index: 0.77 vs. 0.68, AUC: 0.80 vs. 0.70). The R + N model identified a low-risk group as deintensified chemoradiotherapy candidates in which no patient developed progression within 3 years, with 5-year progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) both 90.7% (hazard ratio (HR) = 4.132, p = 0.018). Our radiomics-based model combining radiomics score and N stage can identify specific LA-NPC candidates for whom de-escalation therapy can be performed without compromising therapeutic efficacy. Our study shows that the radiomics-based model (R + N) can accurately stratify patients into different risk groups, with satisfactory prognosis in the low-risk group when treated with low-dose concurrent chemotherapy, providing new options for individualized de-escalation strategies. • A radiomics score, consisting of 3 predictive radiomics features (flatness, mean, and GLDM-GLN) integrated with the N stage, can identify specific LA-NPC populations for deintensified treatment. • In the selection of LA-NPC candidates for de-intensified treatment, radiomics score extracted from primary nasopharyngeal tumors based on CECT can be superior to traditional T stage classification as a predictor.",1969
37589906,Take a break: should breaks be enforced during digital breast tomosynthesis reading sessions?,European radiology,2024,"Digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) can improve diagnostic accuracy compared to 2D mammography, but DBT reporting is time-consuming and potentially more fatiguing. Changes in diagnostic accuracy and subjective and objective fatigue were evaluated over a DBT reporting session, and the impact of taking a reporting break was assessed. Forty-five National Health Service (NHS) mammography readers from 6 hospitals read a cancer-enriched set of 40 DBT cases whilst eye tracked in this prospective cohort study, from December 2020 to April 2022. Eye-blink metrics were assessed as objective fatigue measures. Twenty-one readers had a reporting break, 24 did not. Subjective fatigue questionnaires were completed before and after the session. Diagnostic accuracy and subjective and objective fatigue measures were compared between the cohorts using parametric and non-parametric significance testing. Readers had on average 10 years post-training breast screening experience and took just under 2 h (105.8 min) to report all cases. Readers without a break reported greater levels of subjective fatigue (44% vs. 33%, p = 0.04), which related to greater objective fatigue: an increased average blink duration (296 ms vs. 286 ms, p < 0.001) and a reduced eye-opening velocity (76 mm/s vs. 82 mm/s, p < 0.001). Objective fatigue increased as the trial progressed for the no break cohort only (ps < 0.001). No difference was identified in diagnostic accuracy between the groups (accuracy: 87% vs. 87%, p = 0.92). Implementing a break during a 2-h DBT reporting session resulted in lower levels of subjective and objective fatigue. Breaks did not impact diagnostic accuracy, which may be related to the extensive experience of the readers. DBT is being incorporated into many mammography screening programmes. Recognising that reporting breaks are required when reading large volumes of DBT studies ensures this can be factored in when setting up reading sessions. Clinical trials registration number: NCT03733106 KEY POINTS: • Use of digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) in breast screening programmes can cause significant reader fatigue. • The effectiveness of incorporating reading breaks into DBT reporting sessions, to reduce mammography reader fatigue, was investigated using eye tracking. • Integrating breaks into DBT reporting sessions reduced reader fatigue; however, diagnostic accuracy was unaffected.",2400

The local responses were categorised into two groups (incomplete and complete). An external validation model and a hybrid model that the patients from two institutions were mixed randomly were proposed. The ESCC patients at stages I-IV who underwent chemoradiotherapy from 2012 to 2017 and had follow-up duration of more than 5 years were included. The patients who received palliative or pre-operable radiotherapy and had no FDG PET images were excluded. The segmentations included the GTV, CTV, and PTV which are used in treatment planning. In addition, shrinkage, expansion, and shell regions were created. Radiomic and dosiomic features were extracted from CT, FDG PET images, and dose distribution. Machine learning-based prediction models were developed using decision tree, support vector machine, k-nearest neighbour (kNN) algorithm, and neural network (NN) classifiers. A total of 116 and 26 patients enrolled at Centre 1 and Centre 2, respectively. The external validation model exhibited the highest accuracy with 65.4% for CT-based radiomics, 77.9% for PET-based radiomics, and 72.1% for dosiomics based on the NN classifiers. The hybrid model exhibited the highest accuracy of 84.4% for CT-based radiomics based on the kNN classifier, 86.0% for PET-based radiomics, and 79.0% for dosiomics based on the NN classifiers. The proposed hybrid model exhibited promising predictive performance for the local response to definitive radiotherapy in ESCC patients. The prediction of the complete response for oesophageal cancer patients may contribute to improving overall survival. The hybrid model has the potential to improve prediction performance than the external validation model that was conventionally proposed. • Radiomics and dosiomics used to predict response in patients with oesophageal cancer receiving definitive radiotherapy. • Hybrid model with neural network classifier of PET-based radiomics improved prediction accuracy by 8.1%. • The hybrid model has the potential to improve prediction performance.",2232

37589900,Radiomics using CT images for preoperative prediction of lymph node metastasis in perihilar cholangiocarcinoma: a multi-centric study.,European radiology,2024,"To develop a CT-based radiomics model for preoperative prediction of lymph node (LN) metastasis in perihilar cholangiocarcinoma (pCCA). The study enrolled consecutive pCCA patients from three independent Chinese medical centers. The Boruta algorithm was applied to build the radiomics signature for the primary tumor and LN. The k-means algorithm was employed to cluster the selected LNs based on the radiomics signature LN. Support vector machines were used to construct the prediction models. The diagnostic efficiency was measured by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). The optimal model was evaluated in terms of calibration, clinical usefulness, and prognostic value. A total of 214 patients were included in the study (mean age: 61.6 years ± 9.4; 130 male). The selected LNs were classified into two clusters, which were significantly correlated with LN metastasis in all cohorts (p < 0.001). The model incorporated the clinical risk factors, radiomics signature primary tumor, and the LN cluster obtained the best discrimination, with AUC values of 0.981 (95% CI: 0.962-1), 0.896 (95% CI: 0.810-0.982), and 0.865 (95% CI: 0.768-0.961) in the training, internal validation, and external validation cohorts, respectively. High-risk patients predicted by the optimal model had shorter overall survival than low-risk patients (median, 13.7 vs. 27.3 months, p < 0.001). The study proposed a radiomics model with good performance to predict LN metastasis in pCCA. As a noninvasive preoperative prediction tool, this model may help in patient risk stratification and personalized treatment. A CT-based radiomics model accurately predicts lymph node metastasis in perihilar cholangiocarcinoma patients. This noninvasive preoperative tool can aid in patient risk stratification and personalized treatment, potentially improving patient outcomes. • The radiomics model based on contrast-enhanced CT is a useful tool for preoperative prediction of lymph node metastasis in perihilar cholangiocarcinoma. • Radiomics features extracted from lymph nodes show great potential for predicting lymph node metastasis. • The study is the first to identify a lymph node phenotype with a high probability of metastasis based on radiomics.",2253
37589899,"Feeding artery: a valuable feature for differentiation of regenerative nodule, dysplastic nodules and small hepatocellular carcinoma in CEUS LI-RADS.",European radiology,2024,"To investigate whether the feeding artery (FA) feature can aid in discriminating small hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) using the contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System (LI-RADS) from precancerous lesions. Between June 2017 and May 2021, a total of 347 patients with 351 precancerous liver lesions or small HCCs who underwent CEUS were enrolled. Two independent radiologists assigned LI-RADS categories to all lesions and assessed the presence of the FA feature, which was used as an ancillary feature to either upgrade or downgrade the LI-RADS category. The diagnostic performance of CEUS LI-RADS, both with and without the FA feature, was evaluated based on accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value. The FA feature was found to be more prevalent in HCC (85.54%, p < 0.001) than in regenerative nodules (RNs, 29.73%), low-grade dysplastic nodules (LGDNs, 33.33%), and high-grade dysplastic nodules (HGDNs, 55.26%). Furthermore, the presence of arterial phase hyperenhancement (APHE), washout (WO), and FA in liver nodules was associated with a higher expression of GPC-3 and Ki-67 compared to the group without these features (p < 0.001). After adjusting, the sensitivity and accuracy of LR-5 for HCC improved from 68.67% (95%CI: 62.46%, 74.30%) to 77.51% (95%CI: 71.72%, 82.44%) and from 69.23% (95%CI: 64.11%, 74.02%) to 73.79% (95%CI: 68.86%, 78.31%), respectively. The FA feature is a valuable feature for distinguishing small HCC and precancerous lesions and could be added as a possible ancillary feature in CEUS LI-RADS which was backed up by biomarkers. The presence of a feeding artery is a valuable imaging feature in the differentiation of HCC and precancerous lesions. Incorporating this characteristic in the CEUS LI-RADS can enhance the diagnostic ability. • Feeding artery is more frequent in HCC than in regenerative nodules, low-grade dysplastic nodules, and high-grade dysplastic nodules. • Feeding artery feature is a valuable ancillary feature for CEUS LI-RADS to differentiate regenerative nodules, low-grade dysplastic nodules, high-grade dysplastic nodules, and HCC. • The existence of feeding artery, arterial phase hyperenhancement, and washout is associated with more GPC-3 positive expression and higher Ki-67 expression than the group without these features.",2374
37589898,LI-RADS threshold growth based on tumor growth rate can improve the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma ≤ 3.0 cm.,European radiology,2024,"Despite the revision of threshold growth (TG) in the Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System (LI-RADS) version 2018, the appropriate time period between the two examinations for TG has not been determined. We compared the accuracy of LI-RADS with TG based on tumor growth rate for the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with that of LI-RADS v2018 based on the original TG. Patients who underwent preoperative MRI for focal solid lesions (≤ 3.0 cm) were retrospectively evaluated. Three readers measured the size of each lesion on prior CT/MRI and index MRI, with tumor growth rate defined as the percent change in lesion size per month. In addition to the original TG (≥ 50% size increase within ≤ 6 months), the modified TG based on tumor growth rates ≥ 10%/month (TG-10%), ≥ 20%/month (TG-20%), and ≥ 30%/month (TG-30%) were evaluated. The accuracies of these evaluation methods for LI-RADS category 5 HCC were compared using generalized estimation equations. A total of 508 lesions from 370 patients were evaluated. Compared with LI-RADS v2018 with the original TG, the accuracy of LI-RADS with TG-10% was significantly higher (85.0% vs. 80.7%, p < .001), whereas the accuracies of LI-RADS with TG-20% (81.3% vs. 80.7%, p = .404) and TG-30% (79.3% vs. 80.7%, p = .052) were not significant. The sensitivity of LI-RADS with TG-10% was higher than that of LI-RADS v2018 (79.0% vs. 72.5%, p < .001), whereas their specificities were not significantly different (96.6% vs. 96.6%, p > .999). TG-10% improved the sensitivity of LI-RADS by detecting additional hepatocellular carcinomas underestimated due to short-term follow-up. Threshold growth based on tumor growth rate can be clinically useful in the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma, by improving the sensitivity of LI-RADS. • The diagnostic accuracy of Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System (LI-RADS) v2018 was not significantly affected by the time interval between prior and index assessments of threshold growth. • In the 334 hepatocellular carcinomas, the frequency of threshold growth was significantly higher using tumor growth rate ≥ 10%/month (TG-10%) than original threshold growth (53.3% vs. 18.0%, p < .001). • Compared with LI-RADS v2018 with the original threshold growth, LI-RADS with TG-10% had significantly higher accuracy (85.0% vs. 80.7%, p < .001) and sensitivity (79.0% vs. 72.5%, p < .001) but a similar specificity (96.6% vs. 96.6%, p > .999).",2436

We aimed to explore whole tumor histogram-derived apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) histogram profiles for differentiating between the presence (Mol-4) and absence (Mol-2/3) of grade 4 molecular features in histologically lower-grade gliomas. Between June 2019 and October 2022, 184 adult patients with diffuse gliomas underwent MRI. After excluding 121 patients, 18 (median age, 64.5 [range, 37-84 years]) Mol-4 and 45 (median 40 [range, 18-73] years) Mol-2/3 patients with histologically lower-grade gliomas were enrolled. Whole tumor volume-of-interest-derived ADC histogram profiles were calculated and compared between the two groups. Stepwise logistic regression analysis with Akaike's information criterion using the ADC histogram profiles with p values < 0.01 and age at diagnosis was used to identify independent variables for predicting the Mol-4 group. The 90th percentile (p < 0.001), median (p < 0.001), mean (p < 0.001), 10th percentile (p = 0.014), and entropy (p < 0.001) of normalized ADC were lower, and kurtosis (p < 0.001) and skewness (p = 0.046) were higher in the Mol-4 group than in the Mol-2/3 group. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that the entropy of normalized ADC and age at diagnosis were independent predictive parameters for the Mol-4 group with an area under the curve of 0.92. ADC histogram profiles may be promising preoperative imaging biomarkers to predict molecular grade 4 among histologically lower-grade adult diffuse gliomas. This study highlighted the diagnostic usefulness of ADC histogram profiles to differentiate histologically lower grade adult diffuse gliomas with the presence of molecular grade 4 features and those without. • ADC histogram profiles to predict molecular CNS WHO grade 4 status among histologically lower-grade adult diffuse gliomas were evaluated. • Entropy of ADC and age were independent predictive parameters for molecular grade 4 status. • ADC histogram analysis is useful for predicting molecular grade 4 among histologically lower-grade gliomas.",2260

The therapeutic effect of this treatment on multifocal papillary thyroid microcarcinoma (MPTMC) is unknown. Therefore, we evaluated the long-term efficacy of MWA for low-risk MPTMC and to provide evidence-based medicine for the revision of clinical guidelines. This study included 66 MPTMC patients with a total of 158 lesions, all of whom received MWA. We collected and retrospectively analyzed the patients' follow-up data before MWA, at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months posttreatment and every 6 months thereafter until 5 years posttreatment. We evaluated the MWA complication rate, technical success rate (TSR), lesion volume reduction rate (VRR), and complete disappearance rate (CDR) during follow-up and in those patients with tumor progression and delayed surgery. After 60 months of follow-up, all 158 lesions disappeared in 66 patients, and the volume was reduced from 43.82 mm Ultrasound-guided MWA for low-risk MPTMC is safe and effective and may serve as an alternative option for patients who refuse surgery or active surveillance (AS). This study concludes that ultrasound-guided microwave ablation for low-risk multifocal papillary thyroid microcarcinoma is safe and effective and may serve as an alternative option for patients who refuse surgery or active surveillance. • Ultrasound-guided microwave ablation for low-risk multifocal papillary thyroid microcarcinoma is safe and effective. • During 5 years of follow-up, multifocal papillary thyroid microcarcinoma patients treated with microwave ablation had a favorable prognosis. • To provide evidence-based medicine for the revision of clinical guidelines.",1747

Purpose To evaluate diagnostic accuracy and association with patient prognosis of viable EMVI and tumor deposit on DW images in patients with LARC after neoadjuvant therapy using whole-mount pathology specimens. Materials and Methods This retrospective study included patients who underwent neoadjuvant therapy and surgery from 2018 to 2021. Innovative five-point Likert scale was used by two radiologists to independently evaluate the likelihood of viable EMVI and tumor deposit on restaging DW MRI scans in four axial quadrants (12 to 3 o'clock, 3 to 6 o'clock, 6 to 9 o'clock, and 9 to 12 o'clock). Diagnostic accuracy was assessed at both the per-quadrant and per-patient level, with whole-mount pathology as the reference standard. Weighted κ values for interreader agreement and Cox regression models for disease-free survival and overall survival analyses were used. Results A total of 117 patients (mean age, 56 years ± 12 [SD]; 70 male, 47 female) were included. Pathologically proven viable EMVI and tumor deposit was detected in 29 of 117 patients (25%) and in 44 of 468 quadrants (9.4%). Per-quadrant analyses showed an area under the receiver operating characteristics curve of 0.75 (95% CI: 0.68, 0.83), with sensitivity and specificity of 55% and 96%, respectively. Good interreader agreement was observed between the radiologists (κ = 0.62). Per-patient analysis showed sensitivity and specificity of 62% and 93%, respectively. The presence of EMVI and tumor deposit on restaging DW MRI scans was associated with worse disease-free survival (hazard ratio [HR], 5.6; 95% CI: 2.4, 13.3) and overall survival (HR, 8.9; 95% CI: 1.6, 48.5). Conclusion DW imaging using the five-point Likert scale showed high specificity and moderate sensitivity in the detection of viable extramural venous invasion and tumor deposits in LARC after neoadjuvant therapy, and its presence on restaging DW MRI scans is associated with worse prognosis.

Purpose To compare the diagnostic performance of CEM, ABMRI, and standard MRI. Materials and Methods This single-institution, prospective, blinded reader study included female participants referred for breast MRI from January 2018 to June 2021. CEM was performed within 14 days of standard MRI; ABMRI was produced from standard MRI images. Two readers independently interpreted each CEM and ABMRI after a washout period. Examination-level performance metrics calculated were recall rate, cancer detection, and false-positive biopsy recommendation rates per 1000 examinations and sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value of biopsy recommendation. Bootstrap and permutation tests were used to calculate 95% CIs and compare modalities. Results Evaluated were 492 paired CEM and ABMRI interpretations from 246 participants (median age, 51 years; IQR, 43-61 years). On 49 MRI scans with lesions recommended for biopsy, nine lesions showed malignant pathology. No differences in ABMRI and standard MRI performance were identified. Compared with standard MRI, CEM demonstrated significantly lower recall rate (14.0% vs 22.8%; difference, -8.7%; 95% CI: -14.0, -3.5), lower false-positive biopsy recommendation rate per 1000 examinations (65.0 vs 162.6; difference, -97.6; 95% CI: -146.3, -50.8), and higher specificity (87.8% vs 80.2%; difference, 7.6%; 95% CI: 2.3, 13.1). Compared with standard MRI, CEM had significantly lower cancer detection rate (22.4 vs 36.6; difference, -14.2; 95% CI: -28.5, -2.0) and sensitivity (61.1% vs 100%; difference, -38.9%; 95% CI: -66.7, -12.5). The performance differences between CEM and ABMRI were similar to those observed between CEM and standard MRI. Conclusion ABMRI had comparable performance to standard MRI and may support more efficient MRI screening. CEM had lower recall and higher specificity compared with standard MRI or ABMRI, offset by lower cancer detection rate and sensitivity compared with standard MRI. These trade-offs warrant further consideration of patient population characteristics before widespread screening with CEM. Clinical trial registration no. NCT03517813 © RSNA, 2023 ",2316

The prognostic value of the markers was examined in Kaplan-Meier analyses with the log-rank test and in uni- and multivariable Cox proportional hazards (CPH) models. The following significant associations were observed: Male patients had higher BMI and SMI. Patients with lower ECOG had lower BMI and SMI. Patients with BMI lower than 21.8 kg/m CT-based markers of sarcopenia and myosteatosis show a prognostic value for assessment of survival in advanced pancreatic cancer patients undergoing HIFU therapy. The results indicate a greater role of myosteatosis for additional risk assessment beyond clinical scores, as only FMF was associated with long-term survival in multivariable CPH analyses along ECOG and also showed independence to ECOG in group analysis. • This study investigates the prognostic value of CT-based markers of sarcopenia and myosteatosis for patients with pancreatic cancer treated with high-intensity focused ultrasound. • Markers for sarcopenia and myosteatosis showed a prognostic value besides clinical assessment of the physical status by the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group score. In contrast to muscle size measurements, the myosteatosis marker fatty muscle fraction demonstrated independence to the clinical score. • The results indicate that myosteatosis might play a greater role for additional patient risk assessments beyond clinical assessments of physical status.",2003
37572191,3D fusion is superior to 2D point-to-point contrast-enhanced US to evaluate the ablative margin after RFA for hepatocellular carcinoma.,European radiology,2024,"To compare the efficiency of three-dimensional (3D) and two-dimensional (2D) contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS)-derived techniques in evaluating the ablative margin (AM) after radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In total, 98 patients with 98 HCCs were enrolled. The 2D CEUS point-to-point imaging (2D CEUS-PI) was conducted by comparing the pre- and post-RFA 2D CEUS images manually, and the 3D CEUS fusion imaging (3D CEUS-FI) was conducted by fusing the pre- and post-RFA 3D CEUS images automatically. These two techniques were compared in distinguishing an adequate AM ≥ 5 mm. Risk factors for local tumor progression (LTP) after RFA were analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method with log-rank test. The mean registration time of 3D CEUS-FI and 2D CEUS-PI was 5.0 and 9.3 min, respectively (p < 0.0001). The kappa coefficient was 0.680 for agreement between 2D CEUS-PI and 3D CEUS-FI in the evaluation of AM (p < 0.0001). Tumors with AM < 5 mm by 2D CEUS-PI were all identified as AM < 5 mm by 3D CEUS-FI. Nonetheless, 16 (26%) tumors identified as AM ≥ 5 mm by 2D CEUS-PI were re-classified as AM < 5 mm by 3D CEUS-FI. During a median follow-up time of 31.2 months (range, 3.2-66.0 months), LTP was identified in 8 tumors. The estimated 1-/2-/3-year cumulative incidence of LTP was 4.4%, 8.1%, and 10.3%, respectively. Higher estimated cumulative incidence of LTP was identified in tumors with AM < 5 mm by 2D CEUS-PI (at 3-year, 27.2% vs 0%; p < 0.001), and by 3D CEUS-FI (at 3-year, 20.7% vs 0%; p = 0.004). 3D CEUS-FI excelled in the evaluation of AM when compared with 2D CEUS-PI. With equivalent efficacy in the prediction of LTP, 3D CEUS-FI was superior to 2D CEUS-PI for its automatic and time-saving procedure. 3D CEUS fusion imaging may serve as an effective tool in evaluating ablative margin and predicting local tumor progression after RFA in HCC. • Both 2D and 3D CEUS-derived techniques could evaluate ablative margin (AM) after RFA for hepatocellular carcinoma. • 3D CEUS fusion imaging was more precise in the evaluation of AM compared to 2D CEUS point-to-point imaging, with advantages of its automatic and time-saving procedure. • An inadequate AM < 5 mm evaluated by CEUS-derived techniques was the only risk factor of LTP after RFA for hepatocellular carcinoma (p < 0.001 for 2D CEUS point-to-point imaging, and p = 0.004 for 3D CEUS fusion imaging).",2400
37572187,Impact of super-resolution and image acquisition on the detection of calcifications in digital breast tomosynthesis.,European radiology,2024,"A virtual clinical trial (VCT) method is proposed to determine the limit of calcification detection in tomosynthesis. Breast anatomy, focal findings, image acquisition, and interpretation (n = 14 readers) were simulated using screening data (n = 660 patients). Calcifications (0.2-0.4 mm Source motion and reconstructed voxel size demonstrated significant changes in the performance of imaging systems. Acquisition geometries that use 70 µm reconstruction voxel size and step-and-shoot motion significantly improved calcification detection. Comparing 70 with 100 µm reconstructed voxel size for step-and-shoot, the ΔAUC was 0.0558 (0.0647) and d' ratio was 1.27 (1.29) for 140 µm (70 µm) detector element size. Comparing step-and-shoot with a continuous motion for a 70 µm reconstructed voxel size, the ΔAUC was 0.0863 (0.0434) and the d' ratio was 1.40 (1.19) for 140 µm (70 µm) detector element. Small detector element sizes (e.g., 70 µm) did not significantly improve detection. The SNR results with the BR3D phantom show that calcification detection is dependent upon reconstructed voxel size and detector element size, supporting VCT results with comparable agreement (ratios: d' = 1.16 ± 0.11, SNR = 1.34 ± 0.13). DBT acquisition geometries that use super-resolution (smaller reconstructed voxels than the detector element size) combined with step-and-shoot motion have the potential to improve the detection of calcifications. Calcifications may not always be discernable in tomosynthesis because of differences in acquisition and reconstruction methods. VCTs can identify strategies to optimize acquisition and reconstruction parameters for calcification detection in tomosynthesis, most notably through super-resolution in the reconstruction. • Super-resolution improves calcification detection and SNR in tomosynthesis; specifically, with the use of smaller reconstruction voxels. • Calcification detection using step-and-shoot motion is superior to that using continuous tube motion. • A detector element size of 70 µm does not provide better detection than 140 µm for small calcifications at the threshold of detectability.",2135
37566274,MRI with DWI improves detection of liver metastasis and selection of surgical candidates with pancreatic cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,European radiology,2024,"To perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate if magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) adds value compared to contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) alone in the preoperative evaluation of pancreatic cancer. MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases were searched for relevant published studies through October 2022. Studies met eligibility criteria if they evaluated the per-patient diagnostic performance of MRI with DWI in the preoperative evaluation of newly diagnosed pancreatic cancer compared to CECT. Our primary outcome was the number needed to treat (NNT) to prevent one futile surgery using MRI with DWI, defined as those in which CECT was negative and MRI with DWI was positive for liver metastasis (i.e., surgical intervention in metastatic disease missed by CECT). The secondary outcomes were to determine the diagnostic performance and the NNT of MRI with DWI to change management in pancreatic cancer. Nine studies met the inclusion criteria with a total of 1121 patients, of whom 172 had liver metastasis (15.3%). The proportion of futile surgeries reduced by MRI with DWI was 6.0% (95% CI, 3.0-11.6%), yielding an NNT of 16.6. The proportion of cases that MRI with DWI changed management was 18.1% (95% CI, 9.9-30.7), corresponding to an NNT of 5.5. The per-patient sensitivity and specificity of MRI were 92.4% (95% CI, 87.4-95.6%) and 97.3% (95% CI, 96.0-98.1). MRI with DWI may prevent futile surgeries in pancreatic cancer by improving the detection of occult liver metastasis on preoperative CECT with an NNT of 16.6. MRI with DWI complements the standard preoperative CECT evaluation for liver metastasis in pancreatic cancer, improving the selection of surgical candidates and preventing unnecessary surgeries. • The NNT of MRI with DWI to prevent potential futile surgeries due to occult liver metastasis on CECT, defined as those in which CECT was negative and MRI with DWI was positive for liver metastasis, in patients with pancreatic cancer was 16.6. • The higher performance of MRI with DWI to detect liver metastasis occult on CECT can be attributed to an increased detection of subcentimeter liver metastasis.",2194
37566273,Magnetic resonance imaging of pilonidal sinus disease: interobserver agreement and practical MRI reporting tips.,European radiology,2024,"To evaluate the interobserver agreement for the features of natal cleft pilonidal sinus disease (PSD) on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and propose a standardized checklist for reporting PSD on MRI. Forty MRI studies of 39 discrete patients with PSD were retrospectively evaluated by five independent radiologists using a standardized checklist. Fleiss' Kappa (k) coefficients of agreement were used to test the agreement between categorical variables. The MRI features of the natal cleft sepsis associated with PSD were classified into four main categories: morphology, branching and extensions, external skin openings, and the relationship of the PSD to the coccyx. A survey was created and disseminated online among general surgeons who treat patients with PSD to assess the relevance of the MRI features proposed in the standardized checklist. The overall agreement regarding the identification of morphology of the natal cleft sepsis was moderate (k = 0.59). Lateral and caudal extensions interobserver agreement was substantial (k = 0.64 and 0.71, respectively). However, the overall agreement regarding the individual parts of anal sphincter involved was moderate (k = 0.47). Substantial interobserver agreement was found in assessing the proximity of the PSD to the coccyx (k = 0.62). Preoperative MRI can delineate the extensions and branching of PSD with substantial agreement. MRI is superior in describing the deep extensions of PSD with better reliability than assessing the number and locations of the external openings. Expert consensus agreement is needed to establish the MRI features necessary for optimal reporting of PSD. MRI can offer valuable information about the extent of sepsis associated with pilonidal sinus disease, particularly in cases with involvement of critical anatomical structures such as the coccyx and anal triangle. MRI can potentially contribute to more accurate patient stratification and surgical planning. • The interobserver agreement for assessing PSD's lateral and caudal extension on MRI is substantial. • MRI can describe deep extensions and branching of PSD with superior reliability than assessing the number and site of external openings. • Reporting the relationship between natal cleft sepsis in PSD and the anal region may influence the surgical approach and postoperative healing.",2338
37566271,Natural language processing to predict isocitrate dehydrogenase genotype in diffuse glioma using MR radiology reports.,European radiology,2023,"To evaluate the performance of natural language processing (NLP) models to predict isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutation status in diffuse glioma using routine MR radiology reports. This retrospective, multi-center study included consecutive patients with diffuse glioma with known IDH mutation status from May 2009 to November 2021 whose initial MR radiology report was available prior to pathologic diagnosis. Five NLP models (long short-term memory [LSTM], bidirectional LSTM, bidirectional encoder representations from transformers [BERT], BERT graph convolutional network [GCN], BioBERT) were trained, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was assessed to validate prediction of IDH mutation status in the internal and external validation sets. The performance of the best performing NLP model was compared with that of the human readers. A total of 1427 patients (mean age ± standard deviation, 54 ± 15; 779 men, 54.6%) with 720 patients in the training set, 180 patients in the internal validation set, and 527 patients in the external validation set were included. In the external validation set, BERT GCN showed the highest performance (AUC 0.85, 95% CI 0.81-0.89) in predicting IDH mutation status, which was higher than LSTM (AUC 0.77, 95% CI 0.72-0.81; p = .003) and BioBERT (AUC 0.81, 95% CI 0.76-0.85; p = .03). This was higher than that of a neuroradiologist (AUC 0.80, 95% CI 0.76-0.84; p = .005) and a neurosurgeon (AUC 0.79, 95% CI 0.76-0.84; p = .04). BERT GCN was externally validated to predict IDH mutation status in patients with diffuse glioma using routine MR radiology reports with superior or at least comparable performance to human reader. Natural language processing may be used to extract relevant information from routine radiology reports to predict cancer genotype and provide prognostic information that may aid in guiding treatment strategy and enabling personalized medicine. • A transformer-based natural language processing (NLP) model predicted isocitrate dehydrogenase mutation status in diffuse glioma with an AUC of 0.85 in the external validation set. • The best NLP models were superior or at least comparable to human readers in both internal and external validation sets. • Transformer-based models showed higher performance than conventional NLP model such as long short-term memory.",2360
37566270,Voxel-wise mapping of DCE-MRI time-intensity-curve profiles enables visualizing and quantifying hemodynamic heterogeneity in breast lesions.,European radiology,2024,"To propose a novel model-free data-driven approach based on the voxel-wise mapping of DCE-MRI time-intensity-curve (TIC) profiles for quantifying and visualizing hemodynamic heterogeneity and to validate its potential clinical applications. From December 2018 to July 2022, 259 patients with 325 pathologically confirmed breast lesions who underwent breast DCE-MRI were retrospectively enrolled. Based on the manually segmented breast lesions, the TIC of each voxel within the 3D whole lesion was classified into 19 subtypes based on wash-in rate (nonenhanced, slow, medium, and fast), wash-out enhancement (persistent, plateau, and decline), and wash-out stability (steady and unsteady), and the composition ratio of these 19 subtypes for each lesion was calculated as a new feature set (type-19). The three-type TIC classification, semiquantitative parameters, and type-19 features were used to build machine learning models for identifying lesion malignancy and classifying histologic grades, proliferation status, and molecular subtypes. The type-19 feature-based model significantly outperformed models based on the three-type TIC method and semiquantitative parameters both in distinguishing lesion malignancy (respectively; AUC = 0.875 vs. 0.831, p = 0.01 and 0.875vs. 0.804, p = 0.03), predicting tumor proliferation status (AUC = 0.890 vs. 0.548, p = 0.006 and 0.890 vs. 0.596, p = 0.020), but not in predicting histologic grades (p = 0.820 and 0.970). In addition to conventional methods, the proposed computational approach provides a novel, model-free, data-driven approach to quantify and visualize hemodynamic heterogeneity. Voxel-wise intra-lesion mapping of TIC profiles allows for visualization of hemodynamic heterogeneity and its composition ratio for differentiation of malignant and benign breast lesions. • Voxel-wise TIC profiles were mapped, and their composition ratio was compared between various breast lesions. • The model based on the composition ratio of voxel-wise TIC profiles significantly outperformed the three-type TIC classification model and the semiquantitative parameters model in lesion malignancy differentiation and tumor proliferation status prediction in breast lesions. • This novel, data-driven approach allows the intuitive visualization and quantification of the hemodynamic heterogeneity of breast lesions.",2356
37566266,Radiomics in the characterization of lipid-poor adrenal adenomas at unenhanced CT: time to look beyond usual density metrics.,European radiology,2024,"In this study, we developed a radiomic signature for the classification of benign lipid-poor adenomas, which may potentially help clinicians limit the number of unnecessary investigations in clinical practice. Indeterminate adrenal lesions of benign and malignant nature may exhibit different values of key radiomics features. Patients who had available histopathology reports and a non-contrast-enhanced CT scan were included in the study. Radiomics feature extraction was done after the adrenal lesions were contoured. The primary feature selection and prediction performance scores were calculated using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO). To eliminate redundancy, the best-performing features were further examined using the Pearson correlation coefficient, and new predictive models were created. This investigation covered 50 lesions in 48 patients. After LASSO-based radiomics feature selection, the test dataset's 30 iterations of logistic regression models produced an average performance of 0.72. The model with the best performance, made up of 13 radiomics features, had an AUC of 0.99 in the training phase and 1.00 in the test phase. The number of features was lowered to 5 after performing Pearson's correlation to prevent overfitting. The final radiomic signature trained a number of machine learning classifiers, with an average AUC of 0.93. Including more radiomics features in the identification of adenomas may improve the accuracy of NECT and reduce the need for additional imaging procedures and clinical workup, according to this and other recent radiomics studies that have clear points of contact with current clinical practice. The study developed a radiomic signature using unenhanced CT scans for classifying lipid-poor adenomas, potentially reducing unnecessary investigations that scored a final accuracy of 93%. • Radiomics has potential for differentiating lipid-poor adenomas and avoiding unnecessary further investigations. • Quadratic mean, strength, maximum 3D diameter, volume density, and area density are promising predictors for adenomas. • Radiomics models reach high performance with average AUC of 0.95 in the training phase and 0.72 in the test phase.",2219
37566265,Spectral CT assists differentiation of osteoblastic bone metastasis from bone island in newly diagnosed cancer patients.,European radiology,2024,"To investigate measurements derived from plain and enhanced spectral CT in differentiating osteoblastic bone metastasis (OBM) from bone island (BI). From January to November 2020, 73 newly diagnosed cancer patients with 201 bone lesions (OBM = 92, BI = 109) having received spectral CT were retrospectively enrolled. Measurements including CT values of 40-140 keV, slope of the spectral curve, effective atomic number (Z All features were significantly different between the BI group and OBM group (all p < 0.05), highly correlated with the corresponding features between plain and enhanced spectral CT both in OBM (r: 0.392-0.763) and BI (r: 0.430-0.544). As for the model performance, the combined model achieved the best performance (AUC = 0.925, 95% CI: 0.879 to 0.957), which significantly outperformed the plain spectral CT model (AUC = 0.815, 95% CI: 0.754 to 0.866, p < 0.001) and enhanced spectral CT model (AUC = 0.901, 95% CI: 0.852 to 0.939, p = 0.024) in differentiating OBM and BI. In addition to plain spectral CT measurements, enhanced spectral CT measurements would further significantly benefit the differential diagnosis. Measurements derived either from plain or enhanced spectral CT could provide additional valuable information to improve the differential diagnosis between OBM and BI in newly diagnosed cancer patients. • We intend to investigate plain and enhanced spectral CT measurements in differentiating OBM from BI. • Both plain and enhanced spectral CT help in discriminating OBM and BI in newly diagnosed cancer patients. • Enhanced spectral CT measurements further improve plain spectral CT measurements-based differential diagnosis.",1666
37566264,Arterial spin labelling MRI for brain tumour surveillance: do we really need cerebral blood flow maps?,European radiology,2023,"Arterial spin labelling (ASL) perfusion MRI is one of the available advanced MRI techniques for brain tumour surveillance. The first aim of this study was to investigate the correlation between quantitative cerebral blood flow (CBF) and non-quantitative perfusion weighted imaging (ASL-PWI) measurements. The second aim was to investigate the diagnostic accuracy of ASL-CBF and ASL-PWI measurements as well as visual assessment for identifying tumour progression. A consecutive cohort of patients who underwent 3-T MRI surveillance containing ASL for treated brain tumours was used. ROIs were drawn in representative parts of tumours in the ASL-CBF maps and copied to the ASL-PWI. ASL-CBF ratios and ASL-PWI ratios of the tumour ROI versus normal appearing white matter (NAWM) were correlated (Pearson correlation) and AUCs were calculated to assess diagnostic accuracy. Additionally, lesions were visually classified as hypointense, isointense, or hyperintense. We calculated accuracy at two thresholds: low threshold (between hypointense-isointense) and high threshold (between isointense-hyperintense). A total of 173 lesions, both enhancing and non-enhancing, measured in 115 patients (93 glioma, 16 metastasis, and 6 lymphoma) showed a very high correlation of 0.96 (95% CI: 0.88-0.99) between ASL-CBF ratios and ASL-PWI ratios. AUC was 0.76 (95%CI: 0.65-0.88) for ASL-CBF ratios and 0.72 (95%CI: 0.58-0.85) for ASL-PWI ratios. Diagnostic accuracy of visual assessment for enhancing lesions was 0.72. ASL-PWI ratios and ASL-CBF ratios showed a high correlation and comparable AUCs; therefore, quantification of ASL-CBF could be omitted in these patients. Visual classification had comparable diagnostic accuracy to the ASL-PWI or ASL-CBF ratios. This study shows that CBF quantification of ASL perfusion MRI could be omitted for brain tumour surveillance and that visual assessment provides the same diagnostic accuracy. This greatly reduces the complexity of the use of ASL in routine clinical practice. • Arterial spin labelling MRI for clinical brain tumour surveillance is undervalued and underinvestigated. • Non-quantitative and quantitative arterial spin labelling assessments show high correlation and comparable diagnostic accuracy. • Quantification of arterial spin labelling MRI could be omitted to improve daily clinical workflow.",2347
37566263,Contrast-enhanced ultrasound with microbubbles containing sulfur hexafluoride and perfluorobutane with Kupffer phase for the detection of colorectal liver metastases.,European radiology,2024,"To compare contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) with microbubbles containing sulfur hexafluoride (SHF) and perfluorobutane (PFB) for the detection of colorectal liver metastasis (CRLM). In this prospective study, conducted from September to November 2021, patients with colorectal cancer were consecutively recruited and underwent same-day ultrasound, SHF-CEUS, and PFB-CEUS. The reference standard was contrast-enhanced MRI and follow-up imaging. The size, depth, echogenicity, and calcification of each focal liver lesion were recorded. The number and conspicuity of CRLMs, based on washout appearance during the late phase (LP) (> 120 s)/Kupffer phase (KP), were evaluated offsite by two blinded readers. Overall, 230 lesions (CRLMs, n = 219; benign lesions, n = 11) in 78 patients were evaluated. Lesion conspicuity (p = 0.344) and accuracy in the detection of CRLM were comparable for SHF- and PFB-CEUS (0.877 for SHF vs. 0.770 for PFB, p = 0.087). More CRLMs ≥ 10 mm were identified by LP contrast washout in SHF-CEUS than in KP PFB-CEUS (p < 0.001). More CRLMs < 10 mm were identified by KP washout in PFB-CEUS than in LP SHF-CEUS (p < 0.001). Conspicuity was better on PFB-CEUS than on SHF-CEUS (p = 0.027). In hyperechoic lesions, lesions located deeper than 80 mm, and calcified lesions, CRLM conspicuity on PFB-CEUS was inferior to that on SHF-CEUS (p < 0.05). The overall accuracy of detection and conspicuity of washout in CRLMs were comparable between SHF and PFB-CEUS. PFB-CEUS has the advantage of identifying washout in small CRLMs. However, larger, hyperechogenic, deep-seated, or calcified lesions were better identified using SHF-CEUS. Accuracy of detection and conspicuity of washout in CRLMs were comparable between SHF- and PFB-CEUS. PFB-CEUS has the advantage in detecting small CRLMs, whereas SHF-CEUS is better for detecting larger, hyperechogenic, deep-seated, or calcified lesions. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound with sulfur hexafluoride in the late phase and perfluorobutane microbubbles in the Kupffer phase were comparable in terms of accuracy in the detection and conspicuity of colorectal liver metastases. Small colorectal liver metastases (< 10 mm) were more often identified in the Kupffer phase contrast-enhanced ultrasound imaging when using perfluorobutane microbubbles. Larger, hyperechogenic, deep-seated, or calcified lesions were better identified in the late phase contrast-enhanced ultrasound imaging (> 120 s) when using sulfur hexafluoride microbubbles.",2497

We conducted a retrospective study of contrast-enhanced breast MRIs performed at our institution before and after the introduction of the HTHS protocol. We compared diagnostic performance of the HTHS and standard protocol by comparing cancer detection rate (CDR) and positive predictive value of biopsy (PPV3) among women with high BPE (ie, marked or moderate). Among women with high BPE, the HTHS protocol demonstrated increased CDR (23.6 per 1,000 patients  Among women with high BPE, HTHS MRI improved diagnostic performance, leading to an additional cancer yield of 15.7 cancers per 1,000 women and concomitantly decreasing unnecessary biopsies by 9.8%. A multisite prospective trial is warranted to confirm these findings and to pave the way for more widespread clinical implementation.",1062
37561183,Design of a magnetic resonance imaging-based screening program for early diagnosis of prostate cancer: preliminary results of a randomized controlled trial-Prostate Cancer Secondary Screening in Sapienza (PROSA).,European radiology,2024,"The main objective is to propose an MRI-based screening protocol, investigating the role of MRI without the injection of contrast media (bi-parametric MRI, bpMRI) as a secondary prevention test for prostate cancer (PCa) early diagnosis, comparing MRI with the prostate specific antigen (PSA) test. For this reason, preliminary results of Prostate Cancer Secondary Screening in Sapienza (PROSA) are presented, to investigate the efficiency of an MRI-based screening protocol. PROSA is a prospective, randomized, single-center study. To date, 351 men have been enrolled and blindly randomized into two different arms: (A) Men underwent a bpMRI regardless of their PSA values (175); (B) Men followed as per clinical practice: those with increased PSA (61) were referred to bpMRI, while those with normal PSA (112) were not. Men who screened positive on MRI were directed to MR-directed targeted biopsy. On arm A, 4 clinically significant PCa have been detected, while none was found on arm B (p = 0.046). To evaluate the efficiency of the screening protocol, we calculated the experimental event rate (EER, 3.6%), control event rate (CER, 1.2%.), absolute risk reduction (ARR, 2.5%), and number needed to treat (NNT, 40.3). PROSA represents an interesting experience in the field of imaging-based PCa screening. The preliminary data from this trial highlight the promising role of non-contrast MRI as a screening tool for early detection of PCa. Further data will finally validate the most appropriate screening program. PROSA depicts an interesting experience in the field of research focused on imaging-based prostate cancer screening. Its preliminary data highlight the promising role of non-contrast MRI as a screening tool for early detection of PCa. • Promotion of an MRI-based screening protocol, investigating the role of non-contrast MRI as a secondary prevention test for prostate cancer early diagnosis, comparing MRI with PSA test. • Prostate Cancer Secondary Screening in Sapienza (PROSA) represents an interesting experience in the field of research focused on imaging-based prostate cancer screening; its preliminary results indicate that it is possible to use non-contrast MRI as a screening tool for early detection of PCa. • This new approach to PCa screening could facilitate the early diagnosis of clinically significant prostate cancer while reducing the number of unnecessary prostate biopsies and the detection of clinically insignificant prostate cancer.",2475
37555959,Assessment of whole-body MRI including diffusion-weighted sequences in the initial staging of breast cancer patients at high risk of metastases in comparison with PET-CT: a prospective cohort study.,European radiology,2024,"The aim of this study was to assess the diffusion-weighted whole-body-MRI (WBMRI) in the initial staging of breast cancer at high risk of metastases in comparison with positron emission tomography (PET)-CT. Forty-five women were prospectively enrolled. The inclusion criteria were female gender, age >18, invasive breast cancer, an initial PET-CT, and a performance status of 0-2. The exclusion criteria were contraindication to WB-MRI and breast cancer recurrence. The primary outcome was the concordance of WB-MRI and PET-CT in the diagnosis of distant metastases, whereas secondary outcomes included their concordance for the primary tumor and regional lymph nodes (LN), as well as the agreement of WB-MRI interpretation between two radiologists. The mean age was 51.2 years with a median size of the primary tumor of 30 mm. Concordance between the two modalities was almost perfect for metastases staging, all sites included (k = 0.862), with excellent interobserver agreement. The accuracy of WB-MRI for detecting regional LN, distant LN, lung, liver, or bone metastases ranged from 91 to 96%. In 2 patients, WB-MRI detected bone metastases that were overlooked by PET-CT. WB-MRI showed a substantial agreement with PET-CT for staging the primary tumor, regional LN status, and stage (k = 0.766, k = 0.756, and k = 0.785, respectively) with a high interobserver agreement. WB-MRI including DWI could be a reliable and reproducible examination in the initial staging of breast cancer patients at high risk of metastases, especially for bone metastases and therefore could be used as a surrogate to PET-CT. Whole-body-MRI including DWI is a promising technique for detecting metastases in the initial staging of breast cancer at high risk of metastases. Whole-body-MRI (WB-MRI) was effective for detecting metastases in the initial staging of 45 breast cancer patients at high risk of metastases in comparison with PET-CT. Concordance between WB-MRI and PET-CT was almost perfect for metastases staging, all sites included, with excellent interobserver agreement. The accuracy of WB-MRI for detecting bone metastases was 92%.",2128
37553488,What predicts durable symptom relief of uterine fibroids treated with MRI-guided focused ultrasound? A multicenter trial in 8 academic centers.,European radiology,2023,"To identify variables predictive of durable clinical success after MRI-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) treatment of uterine fibroids. In this prospective, multicenter trial, 99 women with symptomatic uterine fibroids were treated using MRgFUS. Pelvic MRI was obtained at baseline and treatment day. The Uterine Fibroid Symptom-Quality of Life questionnaire was used to calculate a symptom severity score (SSS) at baseline and 6, 12, 24, and 36 months following treatment. Clinical, imaging, and treatment variables were correlated with symptom reduction sustained through the 12- and 24-month time points using univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses. A novel parameter, the ratio of non-perfused volume to total fibroid load (NPV/TFL), was developed to determine association with durable outcomes. Post-treatment, mean symptom severity decreased at the 6-, 12-, 24-, and 36-month follow-ups (p < 0.001, all time points). In univariable analysis, three variables predicted treatment success (defined by ≥ 30-point improvement in SSS) sustained at both the 12-month and 24-month time points: increasing ratio of NPV/TFL (p = 0.002), decreasing total fibroid load (p = 0.04), and the absence of T2-weighted Funaki type 2 fibroids (p = 0.02). In multivariable analysis, the NPV/TFL was the sole predictor of durable clinical success (p = 0.01). Patients with ratios below 30% had less improvement in SSS and lacked durable clinical response compared with those between 30-79 (p = 0.03) and ≥ 80% (p = 0.01). Increased non-perfused volume relative to total fibroid volume was significantly associated with durable reduction of symptoms of abnormal uterine bleeding and bulk bother. Patient selection for sustained clinical benefit should emphasize those with likelihood of achieving high ablation ratios, as determined by imaging (e.g., device access, Funaki type) and by considering the total fibroid load, not just the primary symptomatic fibroid. Clinical trial ID: NCT01285960. • Patient selection/treatment approach associated with durable symptom relief in MRI-guided focused ultrasound ablation of uterine fibroids remains unclear. • The ablation ratio, non-perfused volume/total fibroid volume, was positively associated with sustained symptom relief in both bleeding and bulk bother at 1- and 2-year follow-ups. • Selecting patients with imaging features that favor a high ratio of ablation to total fibroid load (including non-targeted fibroids) is the main factor in predicting durability of symptom relief after uterine fibroid treatment.",2568
37553486,A novel MRI-based deep learning networks combined with attention mechanism for predicting CDKN2A/B homozygous deletion status in IDH-mutant astrocytoma.,European radiology,2024,"To develop a high-accuracy MRI-based deep learning method for predicting cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A/B (CDKN2A/B) homozygous deletion status in isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)-mutant astrocytoma. Multiparametric brain MRI data and corresponding genomic information of 234 subjects (111 positives for CDKN2A/B homozygous deletion and 123 negatives for CDKN2A/B homozygous deletion) were obtained from The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) respectively. Two independent multi-sequence networks (ResFN-Net and FN-Net) are built on the basis of ResNet and ConvNeXt network combined with attention mechanism to classify CDKN2A/B homozygous deletion status using MR images including contrast-enhanced T1-weighted imaging (CE-T1WI) and T2-weighted imaging (T2WI). The performance of the network is summarized by three-way cross-validation; ROC analysis is also performed. The average cross-validation accuracy (ACC) of ResFN-Net is 0.813. The average cross-validation area under curve (AUC) of ResFN-Net is 0.8804. The average cross-validation ACC and AUC of FN-Net is 0.9236 and 0.9704, respectively. Comparing all sequence combinations of the two networks (ResFN-Net and FN-Net), the sequence combination of CE-T1WI and T2WI performed the best, and the ACC and AUC were 0.8244, 0.8975 and 0.8971, 0.9574, respectively. The FN-Net deep learning networks based on ConvNeXt network achieved promising performance for predicting CDKN2A/B homozygous deletion status of IDH-mutant astrocytoma. A novel deep learning network (FN-Net) based on preoperative MRI was developed to predict the CDKN2A/B homozygous deletion status. This network has the potential to be a practical tool for the noninvasive characterization of CDKN2A/B in glioma to support personalized classification and treatment planning. • CDKN2A/B homozygous deletion status is an important marker for glioma grading and prognosis. • An MRI-based deep learning approach was developed to predict CDKN2A/B homozygous deletion status. • The predictive performance based on ConvNeXt network was better than that of ResNet network.",2118
37552258,Radiomics analysis from magnetic resonance imaging in predicting the grade of nonfunctioning pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors: a multicenter study.,European radiology,2024,"To explore the potential of radiomics features to predict the histologic grade of nonfunctioning pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (NF-PNET) patients using non-contrast sequence based on MRI. Two hundred twenty-eight patients with NF-PNETs undergoing MRI at 5 centers were retrospectively analyzed. Data from center 1 (n = 115) constituted the training cohort, and data from centers 2-5 (n = 113) constituted the testing cohort. Radiomics features were extracted from T2-weighted images and the apparent diffusion coefficient. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator was applied to select the most important features and to develop radiomics signatures. The area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was performed to assess models. Tumor boundary, enhancement homogeneity, and vascular invasion were used to construct the radiological model to stratify NF-PNET patients into grade 1 and 2/3 groups, which yielded AUC of 0.884 and 0.684 in the training and testing groups. A radiomics model including 4 features was constructed, with an AUC of 0.941 and 0.871 in the training and testing cohorts. The fusion model combining the radiomics signature and radiological characteristics showed good performance in the training set (AUC = 0.956) and in the testing set (AUC = 0.864), respectively. The developed model that integrates radiomics features with radiological characteristics could be used as a non-invasive, dependable, and accurate tool for the preoperative prediction of grade in NF-PNETs. Our study revealed that the fusion model based on a non-contrast MR sequence can be used to predict the histologic grade before operation. The radiomics model may be a new and effective biological marker in NF-PNETs. The diagnostic performance of the radiomics model and fusion model was better than that of the model based on clinical information and radiological features in predicting grade 1 and 2/3 of nonfunctioning pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (NF-PNETs). Good performance of the model in the four external testing cohorts indicated that the radiomics model and fusion model for predicting the grades of NF-PNETs were robust and reliable, indicating the two models could be used in the clinical setting and facilitate the surgeons' decision on risk stratification. The radiomics features were selected from non-contrast T2-weighted images (T2WI) and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) sequence, which means that the administration of contrast agent was not needed in grading the NF-PNETs.",2518
37552257,A multi-center diagnostic system for intrahepatic mass-forming cholangiocarcinoma based on preoperative MRI and clinical features.,European radiology,2024,"To establish a non-invasive diagnostic system for intrahepatic mass-forming cholangiocarcinoma (IMCC) via decision tree analysis. Totally 1008 patients with 504 pathologically confirmed IMCCs and proportional hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) and combined hepatocellular cholangiocarcinomas (cHCC-CC) from multi-centers were retrospectively included (internal cohort n = 700, external cohort n = 308). Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were applied to evaluate the independent clinical and MRI predictors for IMCC, and the selected features were used to develop a decision tree-based diagnostic system. Diagnostic efficacy of the established system was calculated by the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis in the internal training-testing and external validation cohorts, and also in small lesions  ≤ 3 cm. Multivariate analysis revealed that female, no chronic liver disease or cirrhosis, elevated carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) level, normal alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level, lobulated tumor shape, progressive or persistent enhancement pattern, no enhancing tumor capsule, targetoid appearance, and liver surface retraction were independent characteristics favoring the diagnosis of IMCC over HCC or cHCC-CC (odds ratio = 3.273-25.00, p < 0.001 to p = 0.021). Among which enhancement pattern had the highest weight of 0.816. The diagnostic system incorporating significant characteristics above showed excellent performance in the internal training (area under the curve (AUC) 0.971), internal testing (AUC 0.956), and external validation (AUC 0.945) cohorts, as well as in small lesions  ≤ 3 cm (AUC 0.956). In consideration of the great generalizability and clinical efficacy in multi-centers, the proposed diagnostic system may serve as a non-invasive, reliable, and easy-to-operate tool in IMCC diagnosis, providing an efficient approach to discriminate IMCC from other HCC-containing primary liver cancers. This study established a non-invasive, easy-to-operate, and explainable decision tree-based diagnostic system for intrahepatic mass-forming cholangiocarcinoma, which may provide essential information for clinical decision-making. • Distinguishing intrahepatic mass-forming cholangiocarcinoma (IMCC) from other primary liver cancers is important for both treatment planning and outcome prediction. • The MRI-based diagnostic system showed great performance with satisfying generalization ability in the diagnosis and discrimination of IMCC. • The diagnostic system may serve as a non-invasive, easy-to-operate, and explainable tool in the diagnosis and risk stratification for IMCC.",2632

Contrast-enhanced US can help distinguish malignant from benign lesions, but its added value to O-RADS has not yet been assessed. Purpose To establish a diagnostic model combining O-RADS and contrast-enhanced US and to validate whether O-RADS plus contrast-enhanced US has a better diagnostic performance than O-RADS alone. Materials and Methods This prospective study included participants from May 2018 to March 2021 who underwent contrast-enhanced US before surgery and had lesions categorized as O-RADS 3, 4, or 5 by US, with a histopathologic reference standard. From April 2021 to July 2022, participants with pathologically confirmed ovarian-adnexal lesions were recruited for the validation group. In the pilot group, the initial enhancement time and enhancement intensity in comparison with the uterine myometrium, contrast agent distribution pattern, and dynamic changes in enhancement of lesions were assessed. Contrast-enhanced US features were used to calculate contrast-enhanced US scores for benign (score ≤2) and malignant (score ≥4) lesions. Lesions were then re-rated according to O-RADS category plus contrast-enhanced US scores. Receiver operating characteristic curves were constructed and compared using the DeLong method. The combined system was validated in an independent group. Results The pilot group included 76 women (mean age, 44 years ± 13 [SD]), and the validation group included 46 women (mean age, 42 years ± 14). Differences in initial enhancement time (",1595

Purpose To automatically identify quantitative properties of the breast parenchyma on baseline DCE MRI scans and assess their association with breast cancer occurrence in women with extremely dense breasts. Materials and Methods This study represents a secondary analysis of the Dense Tissue and Early Breast Neoplasm Screening trial. MRI was performed in eight hospitals between December 2011 and January 2016. After segmentation of fibroglandular tissue, quantitative features (including volumetric density, volumetric morphology, and enhancement characteristics) of the parenchyma were extracted from baseline MRI scans. Principal component analysis was used to identify parenchymal measures with the greatest variance. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression was applied to assess the association between breast cancer occurrence and quantitative parenchymal features, followed by stratification of significant features into tertiles. Results A total of 4553 women (mean age, 55.7 years ± 6 [SD]) with extremely dense breasts were included; of these women, 122 (3%) were diagnosed with breast cancer. Five principal components representing 96% of the variance were identified, and the component explaining the greatest independent variance (42%) consisted of MRI features relating to volume of enhancing parenchyma.

This study was designed to compare the real-world efficacy and safety of MWA or surgery for treating T1bN0M0 PTC. From December 2019 to April 2021, 123 continuous unifocal T1bN0M0 PTC patients without lymph node metastasis (LNM) or distant metastasis (DM) were included from 10 hospitals. Patients were allocated into the MWA or surgery group based on their willingness. The main outcomes were local tumour progression (LTP), new thyroid cancer, LNM, and DM. The secondary outcomes included changes in tumour size and volume, complications, and cosmetic results. Subgroup analyses were conducted to identify influencing factors. Fifty-two patients chose MWA, and 71 patients chose surgery. Patients had similar demographic information and tumour characteristics in the two groups. The follow-up durations after MWA and surgery were 10.6 ± 4.2 and 10.4 ± 3.4 months, respectively. The LNM rate was 5.8% in the MWA group and 1.4% in the surgery group (p = 0.177). No LTP, new thyroid cancer, or distant metastasis (DM) occurred in either group. Five (9.6%) of the 52 patients in the MWA group and 8 (11.3%) of the 71 patients in the surgery group had complications (p = 0.27). Better cosmetic results were found in the MWA group (p < 0.01). MWA achieved comparable short-term treatment efficacy with surgery. MWA might be an optional choice for surgery for low-risk T1bN0M0 PTC but concerns about LNM need to be studied further.

Despite its considerable histological and molecular heterogeneity, those characteristics are not distinguished in most definitions of oligometastatic disease and clinical trials of oligometastatic breast cancer. After an exhaustive review of the literature covering all aspects of oligometastatic breast cancer, 35 experts from the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Imaging and Breast Cancer Groups elaborated a Delphi questionnaire aimed at offering consensus recommendations, including oligometastatic breast cancer definition, optimal diagnostic pathways, and clinical trials required to evaluate the effect of diagnostic imaging strategies and metastasis-directed therapies. The main recommendations are the introduction of modern imaging methods in metastatic screening for an earlier diagnosis of oligometastatic breast cancer and the development of prospective trials also considering the histological and molecular complexity of breast cancer. Strategies for the randomisation of imaging methods and therapeutic approaches in different subsets of patients are also addressed.",1181

Oncology,2023,"Retrospective studies have shown promising results using artificial intelligence (AI) to improve mammography screening accuracy and reduce screen-reading workload; however, to our knowledge, a randomised trial has not yet been conducted. We aimed to assess the clinical safety of an AI-supported screen-reading protocol compared with standard screen reading by radiologists following mammography. In this randomised, controlled, population-based trial, women aged 40-80 years eligible for mammography screening (including general screening with 1·5-2-year intervals and annual screening for those with moderate hereditary risk of breast cancer or a history of breast cancer) at four screening sites in Sweden were informed about the study as part of the screening invitation. Those who did not opt out were randomly allocated (1:1) to AI-supported screening (intervention group) or standard double reading without AI (control group). Screening examinations were automatically randomised by the Picture Archive and Communications System with a pseudo-random number generator after image acquisition. The participants and the radiographers acquiring the screening examinations, but not the radiologists reading the screening examinations, were masked to study group allocation. The AI system (Transpara version 1.7.0) provided an examination-based malignancy risk score on a 10-level scale that was used to triage screening examinations to single reading (score 1-9) or double reading (score 10), with AI risk scores (for all examinations) and computer-aided detection marks (for examinations with risk score 8-10) available to the radiologists doing the screen reading. Here we report the prespecified clinical safety analysis, to be done after 80 000 women were enrolled, to assess the secondary outcome measures of early screening performance (cancer detection rate, recall rate, false positive rate, positive predictive value [PPV] of recall, and type of cancer detected [invasive or in situ]) and screen-reading workload. Analyses were done in the modified intention-to-treat population (ie, all women randomly assigned to a group with one complete screening examination, excluding women recalled due to enlarged lymph nodes diagnosed with lymphoma). The lowest acceptable limit for safety in the intervention group was a cancer detection rate of more than 3 per 1000 participants screened. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04838756, and is closed to accrual; follow-up is ongoing to assess the primary endpoint of the trial, interval cancer rate. Between April 12, 2021, and July 28, 2022, 80 033 women were randomly assigned to AI-supported screening (n=40 003) or double reading without AI (n=40 030). 13 women were excluded from the analysis. The median age was 54·0 years (IQR 46·7-63·9). Race and ethnicity data were not collected. AI-supported screening among 39 996 participants resulted in 244 screen-detected cancers, 861 recalls, and a total of 46 345 screen readings. Standard screening among 40 024 participants resulted in 203 screen-detected cancers, 817 recalls, and a total of 83 231 screen readings. Cancer detection rates were 6·1 (95% CI 5·4-6·9) per 1000 screened participants in the intervention group, above the lowest acceptable limit for safety, and 5·1 (4·4-5·8) per 1000 in the control group-a ratio of 1·2 (95% CI 1·0-1·5; p=0·052). Recall rates were 2·2% (95% CI 2·0-2·3) in the intervention group and 2·0% (1·9-2·2) in the control group. The false positive rate was 1·5% (95% CI 1·4-1·7) in both groups. The PPV of recall was 28·3% (95% CI 25·3-31·5) in the intervention group and 24·8% (21·9-28·0) in the control group. In the intervention group, 184 (75%) of 244 cancers detected were invasive and 60 (25%) were in situ; in the control group, 165 (81%) of 203 cancers were invasive and 38 (19%) were in situ. The screen-reading workload was reduced by 44·3% using AI. AI-supported mammography screening resulted in a similar cancer detection rate compared with standard double reading, with a substantially lower screen-reading workload, indicating that the use of AI in mammography screening is safe. The trial was thus not halted and the primary endpoint of interval cancer rate will be assessed in 100 000 enrolled participants after 2-years of follow up.

37540556,Depth of Radiographic Response and Time to Tumor Regrowth Predicts Overall Survival Following Anti-VEGF Therapy in Recurrent Glioblastoma.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,2023,"Antiangiogenic therapies are known to cause high radiographic response rates due to reduction in vascular permeability resulting in a lower degree of contrast extravasation. In this study, we investigate the prognostic ability for model-derived parameters describing enhancing tumor volumetric dynamics to predict survival in recurrent glioblastoma treated with antiangiogenic therapy. N = 276 patients in two phase II trials were used as training data, including bevacizumab ± irinotecan (NCT00345163) and cabozantinib (NCT00704288), and N = 74 patients in the bevacizumab arm of a phase III trial (NCT02511405) were used for validation. Enhancing volumes were estimated using T1 subtraction maps, and a biexponential model was used to estimate regrowth (g) and regression (d) rates, time to tumor regrowth (TTG), and the depth of response (DpR). Response characteristics were compared to diffusion MR phenotypes previously shown to predict survival. Optimized thresholds occurred at g = 0.07 months-1 (phase II: HR = 0.2579, P = 5 × 10-20; phase III: HR = 0.2197, P = 5 × 10-5); d = 0.11 months-1 (HR = 0.3365, P < 0.0001; HR = 0.3675, P = 0.0113); TTG = 3.8 months (HR = 0.2702, P = 6 × 10-17; HR = 0.2061, P = 2 × 10-5); and DpR = 11.3% (HR = 0.6326, P = 0.0028; HR = 0.4785, P = 0.0206). Multivariable Cox regression controlling for age and baseline tumor volume confirmed these factors as significant predictors of survival. Patients with a favorable pretreatment diffusion MRI phenotype had a significantly longer TTG and slower regrowth. Recurrent glioblastoma patients with a large, durable radiographic response to antiangiogenic agents have significantly longer survival. This information is useful for interpreting activity of antiangiogenic agents in recurrent glioblastoma.",1787
37540319,The MRI radiomics signature can predict the pathologic response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in locally advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.,European radiology,2024,"To investigate the MRI radiomics signatures in predicting pathologic response among patients with locally advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT). Patients who underwent NACT from March 2015 to October 2019 were prospectively included. Each patient underwent esophageal MR scanning within one week before NACT and within 2-3 weeks after completion of NACT, prior to surgery. Radiomics features extracted from T2-TSE-BLADE were randomly split into the training and validation sets at a ratio of 7:3. According to the progressive tumor regression grade (TRG), patients were stratified into two groups: good responders (GR, TRG 0 + 1) and poor responders (non-GR, TRG 2 + 3). We constructed the Pre/Post-NACT model (Pre/Post-model) and the Delta-NACT model (Delta-model). Kruskal-Wallis was used to select features, logistic regression was used to develop the final model. A total of 108 ESCC patients were included, and 3/2/4 out of 107 radiomics features were selected for constructing the Pre/Post/Delta-model, respectively. The selected radiomics features were statistically different between GR and non-GR groups. The highest area under the curve (AUC) was for the Delta-model, which reached 0.851 in the training set and 0.831 in the validation set. Among the three models, Pre-model showed the poorest performance in the training and validation sets (AUC, 0.466 and 0.596), and the Post-model showed better performance than the Pre-model in the training and validation sets (AUC, 0.753 and 0.781). MRI-based radiomics models can predict the pathological response after NACT in ESCC patients, with the Delta-model exhibiting optimal predictive efficacy. MRI radiomics features could be used as a useful tool for predicting the efficacy of neoadjuvant chemotherapy in esophageal carcinoma patients, especially in selecting responders among those patients who may be candidates to benefit from neoadjuvant chemotherapy. • The MRI radiomics features based on T2WI-TSE-BLADE could potentially predict the pathologic response to NACT among ESCC patients. • The Delta-model exhibited the best predictive ability for pathologic response, followed by the Post-model, which similarly had better predictive ability, while the Pre-model performed less well in predicting TRG.",2324
37540318,Early post-treatment MRI predicts long-term hepatocellular carcinoma response to radiation segmentectomy.,European radiology,2024,"Radiation segmentectomy using yttrium-90 plays an emerging role in the management of early-stage HCC. However, the value of early post-treatment MRI for response assessment is uncertain. We assessed the value of response criteria obtained early after radiation segmentectomy in predicting long-term response in patients with HCC. Patients with HCC who underwent contrast-enhanced MRI before, early, and 12 months after radiation segmentectomy were included in this retrospective single-center study. Three independent radiologists reviewed images at baseline and 1 Eighty patients (M/F 60/20, mean age 67.7 years) with 80 HCCs were assessed (median size baseline, 1.8 cm [IQR, 1.4-2.9 cm]). At 12 months, 74 patients were classified as CR (92.5%), 5 as partial response (6.3%), and 1 as progressive disease (1.2%). Diagnostic accuracy for predicting CR was fair to good for all readers with excellent positive predictive value (PPV): mRECIST (range between 3 readers, accuracy: 0.763-0.825, PPV: 0.966-1), LI-RADS TRA (accuracy: 0.700-0.825, PPV: 0.983-1), and subtraction (accuracy: 0.775-0.825, PPV: 0.967-1), with no difference in accuracy between criteria (p range 0.053 to > 0.9). mRECIST, LI-RADS TRA, and subtraction obtained on early post-treatment MRI show similar performance for predicting long-term response in patients with HCC treated with radiation segmentectomy. Response assessment extracted from early post-treatment MRI after radiation segmentectomy predicts complete response in patients with HCC with high PPV (≥ 0.96). • Early post-treatment response assessment on MRI predicts response in patients with HCC treated with radiation segmentectomy with fair to good accuracy and excellent positive predictive value. • There was no difference in diagnostic accuracy between mRECIST, LI-RADS, and subtraction for predicting HCC response to radiation segmentectomy.",1881

A combined model was constructed and displayed as a radiomics nomogram. Two radiologists jointly assessed tumor category based on MRI findings. The performances of the radiomics models and visual assessment were compared via area under the curve (AUC). The performances of the radiomics nomogram combining T2WI and CET1WI radiomics scores were superior to those of the pooled readers in the training (AUC 0.986 vs. 0.807, p < 0.001), validation (AUC 0.989 vs. 0.788, p = 0.009), and the testing (AUC 0.903 vs. 0.792, p = 0.093), although significant difference was not found in the testing cohort. Decision curve analysis demonstrated that the radiomics nomogram had better clinical utility than visual assessment. MRI radiomics nomogram can be used for distinguishing between orbital SFT and schwannoma, which may help tumor management by clinicians. It is of great importance and challenging for distinguishing solitary fibrous tumor from schwannoma in the orbit. In the present study, an MRI-based radiomics nomogram were developed and independently validated, which could help the discrimination of the two entities. • It is challenging to differentiate solitary fibrous tumor from schwannoma in the orbit due to similar clinical and image features. • A radiomics nomogram based on T2-weighted imaging and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted imaging has advantages over radiologists. • Radiomics can provide a non-invasive diagnostic tool for differentiating between the two entities.",2191

Patients who underwent gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI and subsequent SR or LT for HCC were retrospectively included between January 2019 and December 2020. The sensitivity and specificity of LI-RADS LR-5 for HCC were compared between the two groups using generalized estimating equations. The accuracy of patient allocation according to the Milan criteria was calculated for the LT group. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to determine significant clinical factors associated with the sensitivity of LI-RADS. Of the 281 patients, 237 were assigned to the SR group, and 44 were assigned to the LT group. The LT group showed significantly lower per-patient (48.5% vs. 79.6%, p < .001) and per-lesion sensitivity (31.0% vs. 75.9%, p < .001) than the SR group, whereas no significant difference in both per-patient (100.0% vs. 91.7%, p > .99) and per-lesion specificities (100.0% vs. 94.1%, p > .99). The accuracy of patient allocation was 50.0%. Sensitivity was significantly lower in patients with a smaller lesion size (p < .001), a larger lesion number (p = .002), and a higher Child-Pugh score (p = .009). LI-RADS v2018 on gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI might be insufficient in liver transplant candidates and other diagnostic imaging tests should be considered in patients with these significant clinical factors. In liver transplant candidates with a smaller lesion size, a larger lesion number, and a higher Child-Pugh score, imaging tests other than gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI may be clinically useful to determine the transplant eligibility. • The sensitivity of the Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System (LI-RADS) was lower in liver transplant candidates than in those who underwent surgical resection. • With the use of gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI, the accuracy of patient allocation for liver transplantation on the basis of the Milan criteria was suboptimal. • The sensitivity of LI-RADS v2018 was significantly associated with lesion size, lesion number, and Child-Pugh classification.",2419

In this prospective study, two groups of 40 participants each underwent abdominal contrast-enhanced scans with full-dose SECT (120-kVp images, DLIR and IR algorithms) or reduced-dose DECT (40- to 60-keV virtual monochromatic images [VMIs], DLIR algorithm), with 122 and 106 metastases, respectively. Groups were matched by age, sex ratio, body mass index, and cross-sectional area. Noise power spectrum of liver images and task-based transfer function of metastases were calculated to assess the noise texture and low-contrast resolution. The image noise, signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) of liver and portal vein, liver-to-lesion contrast-to-noise ratio (LLR), lesion conspicuity, lesion detection rate, and the subjective image quality metrics were compared between groups on 1.25-mm reconstructed images. Compared to 120-kVp images with IR, 40- and 50-keV VMIs with DLIR showed similar noise texture and LLR, similar or higher image noise and low-contrast resolution, improved SNR and lesion conspicuity, and similar or better perceptual image quality. When compared to 120-kVp images with DLIR, 50-keV VMIs with DLIR had similar low-contrast resolution, SNR, LLR, lesion conspicuity, and perceptual image quality but lower frequency noise texture and higher image noise. For the detection of hepatic metastases, reduced-dose DECT by 34% maintained observer lesion detection rates. DECT assisted with DLIR enables a 34% dose reduction for detecting hepatic metastases while maintaining comparable perceptual image quality to full-dose SECT. Reduced-dose dual-energy CT with deep learning image reconstruction is as accurate as standard-dose single-energy CT for the detection of liver metastases and saves more than 30% of the radiation dose. • The 40- and 50-keV virtual monochromatic images (VMIs) with deep learning image reconstruction (DLIR) improved lesion conspicuity compared with 120-kVp images with iterative reconstruction while providing similar or better perceptual image quality. • The 50-keV VMIs with DLIR provided comparable perceptual image quality and lesion conspicuity to 120-kVp images with DLIR. • The reduction of radiation by 34% by DLIR in low-keV VMIs is clinically sufficient for detecting low-contrast hepatic metastases.",2483

The imaging differences between HER2-zero (immunohistochemistry [IHC] score of 0), HER2-low (IHC score of 1+ or 2+ with negative findings at fluorescence in situ hybridization [FISH]), and HER2-positive (IHC score of 2+ with positive findings at FISH or IHC score of 3+) breast cancers were unknown. Purpose To assess whether multiparametric dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI-based radiomic features can help distinguish HER2 expressions in breast cancer. Materials and Methods This study included women with breast cancer who underwent MRI at two different centers between December 2020 and December 2022. Tumor segmentation and radiomic feature extraction were performed on T2-weighted and dynamic contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images. Unsupervised correlation analysis of reproducible features and least absolute shrinkage and selector operation were used for the selection of features to build a radiomics signature.

In this multicentre, retrospective study, 456 consecutive women were enrolled from three institutions. Institutions 1 and 2 were used to train (n = 320) and test (n = 136), and 130 patients from institution 3 were used for external validation. Radiomics features that reflected tumour information were derived from grey-scale US images. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator and the maximum relevance minimum redundancy (mRMR) algorithm were used for feature selection and radiomics signature (RS) building. US radiomics-based nomogram was constructed by using multivariable logistic regression analysis. Predictive performance was assessed with the receiving operating characteristic curve, discrimination, and calibration. The nomogram based on clinico-ultrasonic features (menopausal status, US-reported lymph node status, posterior echo features) and RS yielded an optimal AUC of 0.88 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.84-0.91), 0.89 (95% CI, 0.84-0.94) and 0.95 (95% CI, 0.92-0.99) in the training, internal and external validation cohort.

A total of 138 PDAC patients who underwent curative R0 resection were retrospectively enrolled and allocated chronologically to training (n = 91, January 2014-July 2019) and validation cohorts (n = 47, August 2019-December 2020). Using univariable and multivariable Cox regression analyses, we constructed a preoperative clinicoradiographic model based on the combination of CECT features and serum CA19-9 concentrations, and validated it in the validation cohort. The prognostic performance was evaluated and compared with that of postoperative clinicopathological and tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) models. Kaplan-Meier analysis was conducted to verify the preoperative prognostic stratification performance of the proposed model. The preoperative clinicoradiographic model included five independent prognostic factors (tumor diameter on CECT > 4 cm, extrapancreatic organ infiltration, CECT-reported lymph node metastasis, peripheral enhancement, and preoperative CA19-9 levels > 180 U/mL). It better predicted DFS than did the postoperative clinicopathological (C-index, 0.802 vs. 0.787; p < 0.05) and TNM (C-index, 0.802 vs. 0.711; p < 0.001) models in the validation cohort. Low-risk patients had significantly better DFS than patients at the high-risk, defined by the model preoperatively (p < 0.001, training cohort; p < 0.01, validation cohort). The clinicoradiographic model, integrating preoperative CECT features and serum CA19-9 levels, helped preoperatively predict postsurgical DFS for PDAC and could facilitate clinical decision-making. We constructed a simple model integrating clinical and radiological features for the prediction of disease-free survival after curative R0 resection in patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma; this novel model may facilitate preoperative identification of patients at high risk of recurrence and metastasis that may benefit from neoadjuvant treatments. • Existing clinicopathological predictors for prognosis in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) patients who underwent R0 resection can only be ascertained postoperatively and do not allow preoperative prediction. • We constructed a clinicoradiographic model, using preoperative contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) features and preoperative carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) levels, and presented it as a nomogram. • The presented model can predict disease-free survival (DFS) in patients with PDAC better than can postoperative clinicopathological or tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) models.",2762
37507610,Application of a validated prostate MRI deep learning system to independent same-vendor multi-institutional data: demonstration of transferability.,European radiology,2023,"To evaluate a fully automatic deep learning system to detect and segment clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa) on same-vendor prostate MRI from two different institutions not contributing to training of the system. In this retrospective study, a previously bi-institutionally validated deep learning system (UNETM) was applied to bi-parametric prostate MRI data from one external institution (A), a PI-RADS distribution-matched internal cohort (B), and a csPCa stratified subset of single-institution external public challenge data (C). csPCa was defined as ISUP Grade Group ≥ 2 determined from combined targeted and extended systematic MRI/transrectal US-fusion biopsy. Performance of UNETM was evaluated by comparing ROC AUC and specificity at typical PI-RADS sensitivity levels. Lesion-level analysis between UNETM segmentations and radiologist-delineated segmentations was performed using Dice coefficient, free-response operating characteristic (FROC), and weighted alternative (waFROC). The influence of using different diffusion sequences was analyzed in cohort A. In 250/250/140 exams in cohorts A/B/C, differences in ROC AUC were insignificant with 0.80 (95% CI: 0.74-0.85)/0.87 (95% CI: 0.83-0.92)/0.82 (95% CI: 0.75-0.89). At sensitivities of 95% and 90%, UNETM achieved specificity of 30%/50% in A, 44%/71% in B, and 43%/49% in C, respectively. Dice coefficient of UNETM and radiologist-delineated lesions was 0.36 in A and 0.49 in B. The waFROC AUC was 0.67 (95% CI: 0.60-0.83) in A and 0.7 (95% CI: 0.64-0.78) in B. UNETM performed marginally better on readout-segmented than on single-shot echo-planar-imaging. For same-vendor examinations, deep learning provided comparable discrimination of csPCa and non-csPCa lesions and examinations between local and two independent external data sets, demonstrating the applicability of the system to institutions not participating in model training. A previously bi-institutionally validated fully automatic deep learning system maintained acceptable exam-level diagnostic performance in two independent external data sets, indicating the potential of deploying AI models without retraining or fine-tuning, and corroborating evidence that AI models extract a substantial amount of transferable domain knowledge about MRI-based prostate cancer assessment. • A previously bi-institutionally validated fully automatic deep learning system maintained acceptable exam-level diagnostic performance in two independent external data sets. • Lesion detection performance and segmentation congruence was similar on the institutional and an external data set, as measured by the weighted alternative FROC AUC and Dice coefficient. • Although the system generalized to two external institutions without re-training, achieving expected sensitivity and specificity levels using the deep learning system requires probability thresholds to be adjusted, underlining the importance of institution-specific calibration and quality control.",2985

Two hundred and thirty-one patients with early-stage NSCLC who underwent CT-guided microwave ablation of the tumor were included for analysis. Among these, 66 lesions were located adjacent to the bronchovascular bundle. Achievement of the specific ablation range (defined as the ablation zone encompassing the tumor and the adjacent vessel) was assessed after ablation. Complications and tumor progression after treatment were examined and compared between the bronchovascular bundle and non-bronchovascular bundle groups. A total of 231 patients were included. Overall, 1-, 2-, and 3-year local progression-free survival (LPFS) was 77.4%, 70.5%, and 63.8%, respectively. Bronchovascular bundle proximity, pure-solid tumor, tumor size, and ablation margin < 5 mm were independent risk factors for local progression in multivariate analysis. In the bronchovascular bundle group, the 1-, 2- and 3-year LPFS rates were 63.0%, 50.7%, and 43.4%, respectively; vessel proximity and specific ablation range failure were independent risk factors for local progression. Overall survival in the entire cohort was 93.0% at 1 year, 76.1% at 2 years, and 55.0% at 3 years. The incidence of postoperative complications did not significantly differ between the two groups (p > 0.05). The most common complication was pneumothorax. Severe hemoptysis did not occur. Tumor location near the bronchovascular bundles was a significant risk factor for local progression after microwave ablation. Achieving a specific ablation range may increase LPFS for these lesions.

Eighty patients with a single HCC who underwent LT as the initial therapy between 2008 and 2017 were included from two tertiary referral medical centers in a HBV-predominant population. A preoperative MVI-risk model was used to identify low- and high-risk patients. Recurrence-free survival (RFS) after LT between the two risk groups was compared using Kaplan-Meier curves with the log-rank test. Prognostic factors for RFS were identified using a multivariable Cox hazard regression analysis. Eighty patients were included (mean age, 51.8 years +/- 7.5 [standard deviation], 65 men). Patients were divided into low-risk (n = 64) and high-risk (n = 16) groups for MVI. The RFS rates after LT were significantly lower in the MVI high-risk group compared to the low-risk group at 1 year (75.0% [95% CI: 56.5-99.5%] vs. 96.9% [92.7-100%], p = 0.048), 3 years (62.5% [42.8-91.4%] vs. 95.3% [90.3-100%], p = 0.008), and 5 years (62.5% [42.8-91.4%] vs. and 95.3% [90.3-100%], p = 0.008). In addition, multivariable analysis showed that MVI high risk was the only significant factor for poor RFS (p = 0.016). HCC patients with a high risk of MVI showed significantly lower RFS after LT than those without. This model could aid in selecting optimal candidates in addition to the Milan criteria when considering upfront LT for patients with HCC if alternative treatment options are available. High risk for microvascular invasion (MVI) in hepatocellular carcinoma patients lowered recurrence-free survival after liver transplantation, despite meeting the Milan criteria. Identifying MVI risk could aid candidate selection for upfront liver transplantation, particularly if alternative treatments are available. • A predictive model-derived microvascular invasion (MVI) high- and low-risk groups had a significant difference in the incidence of MVI on pathology. • Recurrence-free survival after liver transplantation (LT) for single hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) within the Milan criteria was significantly different between the MVI high- and low-risk groups. • The peak incidence of tumor recurrence was 20 months after liver transplantation, probably indicating that HCC with high risk for MVI had a high risk of early (≤ 2 years) tumor recurrence.",2455

The diagnostic performance of the selected imaging feature, including accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity, was validated and compared with the conventional clinical tumor stage (cT) by the McNemar test. In the training cohort, a total of 268 patients were enrolled, and only SAS was significantly different between pT1-3 and pT4a tumors. The accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of the SAS and conventional cT in differentiating T1-3 and T4a tumors were 94.4%, 81.6%, and 97.3% and 53.7%, 32.7%, and 58.4%, respectively (all p < 0.001). In the validation cohort, a total of 135 patients were collected. The accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of the SAS and the conventional cT were 93.3%, 76.2%, and 96.5% and 62.2%, 38.1%, and 66.7%, respectively (p < 0.001, p = 0.021, p < 0.001). Small arteriole sign positivity, an indirect imaging feature of serosa invasion, may improve the accuracy of identifying T4a colon cancer. Small arteriole sign helps to distinguish T1-3 and T4a colon cancer and further improves the accuracy of preoperative CT staging of colon cancer. • The accuracy of preoperative CT staging of colon cancer is not ideal, especially for T4a tumors. • Small arteriole sign (SAS) is a newly defined imaging feature that shows the appearance of tumor-supplying arterioles at the site where they penetrate the intestine wall. • SAS is an indirect imaging marker of tumor invasion into the serosa with a great value in distinguishing between T1-3 and T4a colon cancer.",2253
37500964,Consensus report from the 10th Global Forum for Liver Magnetic Resonance Imaging: developments in HCC management.,European radiology,2023,"The 10th Global Forum for Liver Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) was held as a virtual 2-day meeting in October 2021, attended by delegates from North and South America, Asia, Australia, and Europe. Most delegates were radiologists with experience in liver MRI, with representation also from specialists in liver surgery, oncology, and hepatology. Presentations, discussions, and working groups at the Forum focused on the following themes: • Gadoxetic acid in clinical practice: Eastern and Western perspectives on current uses and challenges in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) screening/surveillance, diagnosis, and management • Economics and outcomes of HCC imaging • Radiomics, artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning (DL) applications of MRI in HCC. These themes are the subject of the current manuscript. A second manuscript discusses multidisciplinary tumor board perspectives: how to approach early-, mid-, and late-stage HCC management from the perspectives of a liver surgeon, interventional radiologist, and oncologist (Taouli et al, 2023). Delegates voted on consensus statements that were developed by working groups on these meeting themes. A consensus was considered to be reached if at least 80% of the voting delegates agreed on the statements. CLINICAL RELEVANCE STATEMENT: This review highlights the clinical applications of gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI for liver cancer screening and diagnosis, as well as its cost-effectiveness and the applications of radiomics and AI in patients with liver cancer. KEY POINTS: • Interpretation of gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI differs slightly between Eastern and Western guidelines, reflecting different regional requirements for sensitivity vs specificity. • Emerging data are encouraging for the cost-effectiveness of gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI in HCC screening and diagnosis, but more studies are required. • Radiomics and artificial intelligence are likely, in the future, to contribute to the detection, staging, assessment of treatment response and prediction of prognosis of HCC-reducing the burden on radiologists and other specialists and supporting timely and targeted treatment for patients.",2163
37495706,Glioblastomas with and without peritumoral fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) hyperintensity present morphological and microstructural differences on conventional MR images.,European radiology,2023,"Glioblastoma (GB) without peritumoral fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) hyperintensity is atypical and its characteristics are barely known. The aim of this study was to explore the differences in pathological and MRI-based intrinsic features (including morphologic and first-order features) between GBs with peritumoral FLAIR hyperintensity (PFH-bearing GBs) and GBs without peritumoral FLAIR hyperintensity (PFH-free GBs). In total, 155 patients with pathologically diagnosed GBs were retrospectively collected, which included 110 PFH-bearing GBs and 45 PFH-free GBs. The pathological and imaging data were collected. The Visually AcceSAble Rembrandt Images (VASARI) features were carefully evaluated. The first-order radiomics features from the tumor region were extracted from FLAIR, apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), and T1CE (T1-contrast enhanced) images. All parameters were compared between the two groups of GBs. The pathological data showed more alpha thalassemia/mental retardation syndrome X-linked (ATRX)-loss in PFH-free GBs compared to PFH-bearing ones (p < 0.001). Based on VASARI evaluation, PFH-free GBs had larger intra-tumoral enhancing proportion and smaller necrotic proportion (both, p < 0.001), more common non-enhancing tumor (p < 0.001), mild/minimal enhancement (p = 0.003), expansive T1/FLAIR ratio (p < 0.001) and solid enhancement (p = 0.009), and less pial invasion (p = 0.010). Moreover, multiple ADC- and T1CE-based first-order radiomics features demonstrated differences, especially the lower intensity heterogeneity in PFH-free GBs (for all, adjusted p < 0.05). Compared to PFH-bearing GBs, PFH-free ones demonstrated less immature neovascularization and lower intra-tumoral heterogeneity, which would be helpful in clinical treatment stratification. Glioblastomas without peritumoral FLAIR hyperintensity show less immature neovascularization and lower heterogeneity leading to potential higher treatment benefits due to less drug resistance and treatment failure. • The study explored the differences between glioblastomas with and without peritumoral FLAIR hyperintensity. • Glioblastomas without peritumoral FLAIR hyperintensity showed less necrosis and contrast enhancement and lower intensity heterogeneity. • Glioblastomas without peritumoral FLAIR hyperintensity had less immature neovascularization and lower tumor heterogeneity.",2387

His medical history revealed that a cardiac mass was detected at echocardiography performed 3 years ago and for similar symptoms. However, he was lost to follow-up before his examinations were concluded. Apart from that, his medical history was unremarkable, and he had not experienced any cardiac symptoms in the intervening 3 years. He had a family history of sudden cardiac death, and his father died of a heart attack when he was 57 years old. Physical examination findings were unremarkable except for increased blood pressure (150/105 mmHg). Laboratory findings, including a complete blood count and creatinine, C-reactive protein, electrolyte, serum calcium, and troponin T levels, were within normal limits. Electrocardiography (ECG) was performed and revealed sinus rhythm and ST depression in the left precordial leads. Transthoracic two-dimensional echocardiography revealed an irregular left ventricle mass. The patient subsequently underwent contrast-enhanced ECG-gated cardiac CT followed by cardiac MRI to evaluate the left ventricle mass.",1212
37489989,Interobserver Variability and Diagnostic Performance in Predicting Malignancy of Pancreatic Intraductal Papillary Mucinous Neoplasm with MRI.,Radiology,2023,"Background The 2017 international consensus guidelines for intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) of the pancreas are widely used. Purpose To evaluate the interobserver agreement and diagnostic performance of MRI assessment in predicting the malignant potential of IPMN according to radiologists' experience. Materials and Methods This multicenter retrospective study included 100 patients with pathologically proven pancreatic IPMN (77 patients with surgery, 23 patients with biopsy) who underwent contrast-enhanced MRI between 2016 and 2021. Eight post-fellowship radiologists (four more-experienced [8-20 years] and four less-experienced [1-4 years] reviewers) evaluated MRI for high-risk stigmata and worrisome features identified by the most recent 2017 guidelines. Interobserver agreement was determined using Fleiss κ statistics according to radiologist experience. The diagnostic performance for malignant IPMN was assessed using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. Results Among 100 patients (mean age, 66 years ± 10 [SD]; 57 men), 52 (52%) had malignant IPMN. For high-risk stigmata, interobserver agreement was substantial for main pancreatic duct size of at least 10 mm (κ = 0.78; 95% CI: 0.75, 0.82), enhancing mural nodule of at least 5 mm (κ = 0.70: 95% CI: 0.66, 0.74), and at least one high-risk stigmata (κ = 0.73: 95% CI: 0.69, 0.76). The worrisome features showed fair to substantial interobserver agreement (κ range, 0.22-0.80). More-experienced reviewers demonstrated better agreement in the assessment of at least one high-risk stigmata than less-experienced reviewers (κ = 0.77 vs κ = 0.69, ",1637
37488296,Predicting visual recovery in pituitary adenoma patients post-endoscopic endonasal transsphenoidal surgery: Harnessing delta-radiomics of the optic chiasm from MRI.,European radiology,2023,"To investigate whether morphological changes after surgery and delta-radiomics of the optic chiasm obtained from routine MRI could help predict postoperative visual recovery of pituitary adenoma patients. A total of 130 pituitary adenoma patients were retrospectively enrolled and divided into the recovery group (n = 87) and non-recovery group (n = 43) according to visual outcome 1 year after endoscopic endonasal transsphenoidal surgery. Morphological parameters of the optic chiasm were measured preoperatively and postoperatively, including chiasmal thickness, deformed angle, and suprasellar extension. Delta-radiomics of the optic chiasm were calculated based on features extracted from preoperative and postoperative coronal T2-weighted images, followed by machine learning modeling using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator wrapped with support vector machine through fivefold cross-validation in the development set. The delta-radiomic model was independently evaluated in the test set, and compared with the combined model that incorporated delta-radiomics, significant clinical and morphological parameters. Postoperative morphological changes of the optic chiasm could not significantly be used as predictors for the visual outcome. In contrast, the delta-radiomics model represented good performances in predicting visual recovery, with an AUC of 0.821 in the development set and 0.811 in the independent test set. Moreover, the combined model that incorporated age and delta-radiomics features of the optic chiasm achieved the highest AUC of 0.841 and 0.840 in the development set and independent test set, respectively. Our proposed machine learning models based on delta-radiomics of the optic chiasm can be used to predict postoperative visual recovery of pituitary adenoma patients. Our delta-radiomics-based models from MRI enable accurate visual recovery predictions in pituitary adenoma patients who underwent endoscopic endonasal transsphenoidal surgery, facilitating better clinical decision-making and ultimately improving patient outcomes. • Prediction of the postoperative visual outcome for pituitary adenoma patients is important but challenging. • Delta-radiomics of the optic chiasm after surgical decompression represented better prognostic performances compared with its morphological changes. • The proposed machine learning models can serve as novel approaches to predict visual recovery for pituitary adenoma patients in clinical practice.",2487
37482548,MR imaging characteristics of different pathologic subtypes of esophageal carcinoma.,European radiology,2023,"To describe the specific MRI characteristics of different pathologic subtypes of esophageal carcinoma (EC) METHODS: This prospective study included EC patients who underwent esophageal MRI and esophagectomy between April 2015 and October 2021. Pathomorphological characteristics of EC such as localized type (LT), ulcerative type (UT), protruding type (PT), and infiltrative type (IT) were assessed by two radiologists relying on the imaging characteristics of tumor, especially the specific imaging findings on the continuity of the mucosa overlying the tumor, the opposing mucosa, mucosa linear thickening, and transmural growth pattern. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) were calculated for the consistency between two readers. The associations of imaging characteristics with different pathologic subtypes were assessed using multilogistic regression model (MLR). A total of 201 patients were identified on histopathology with a high inter-reader agreement (ICC = 0.991). LT showed intact mucosa overlying the tumor. IT showed transmural growth pattern extending from the mucosa to the adventitia and a ""sandwich"" appearance. The remaining normal mucosa on the opposing side was linear and nodular in UT. PT showed correlation with T1 staging and grade 1; IT showed correlation with T3 staging and grades 2-3. Four MLR models showed high predictive performance on the test set with AUCs of 0.94 (LT), 0.87 (PT), 0.96 (IT), and 0.97 (UT), respectively, and the predictors that contributed most to the models matched the four specific characteristics. Different pathologic subtypes of EC displayed specific MR imaging characteristics, which could help predict T staging and the degree of pathological differentiation. Different pathologic subtypes of esophageal carcinoma displayed specific MR imaging characteristics, which correspond to differences in the degree of differentiation, T staging, and sensitivity to radiotherapy, and could also be one of the predictive factors of cause-specific survival and local progression-free rates. Different types of EC had different characteristics on MR images. A total of 91/95 (96%) LTEC showed intact mucosa over the tumor, while masses or nodules are specific to PTEC; 21/27 (78%) ITEC showed a ""sandwich"" sign; and 33/35 (60%) UTEC showed linear and nodular opposing mucosa. In the association of tumor type with degree of differentiation and T staging, PTEC was predominantly associated with T1 and grade 1, and ITEC was associated with T3 and grades 2-3, while LTEC and UECT were likewise primarily linked with T2-3 and grades 2-3.",2590
37481690,A survey by the European Society of Breast Imaging on radiologists' preferences regarding quality assurance measures of image interpretation in screening and diagnostic mammography.,European radiology,2023,"Quality assurance (QA) of image interpretation plays a key role in screening and diagnostic mammography, maintaining minimum standards and supporting continuous improvement in interpreting images. However, the QA structure across Europe shows considerable variation. The European Society of Breast Imaging (EUSOBI) conducted a survey among the members to collect information on radiologists' preferences regarding QA measures in mammography. An anonymous online survey consisting of 25 questions was distributed to all EUSOBI members and national breast radiology bodies in Europe. The questions were designed to collect demographic characteristics, information on responders' mammography workload and data about QA measures currently used in their country. Data was analysed using descriptive statistical analysis, the χ In total, 251 breast radiologists from 34 countries completed the survey. Most respondents were providing both screening and symptomatic services (137/251, 54.6%), working in an academic hospital (85/251, 33.9%) and reading 1000-4999 cases per year (109/251, 43.4%). More than half of them (133/251, 53%) had established QA measures in their workplace. Although less than one-third (71/251, 28.3%) had to participate in regular performance testing, the vast majority (190/251, 75.7%) agreed that a mandatory test would be helpful to improve their skills. QA measures were in place for more than half of the respondents working in screening and diagnostic mammography to evaluate their breast imaging performance. Although there were substantial differences between countries, the importance of having QA in the workplace and implemented was widely acknowledged by radiologists. Although several quality assurance (QA) measures of image interpretation are recommended by European bodies or national organisations, the QA in mammography is quite heterogenous between countries and reporting settings, and not always actively implemented across Europe. The first survey that presents radiologists' preferences regarding QA measures of image interpretation in mammography. Quality assurance measures in the workplace are better-established for breast screening compared to diagnostic mammography. Radiologists consider that performance tests would help to improve their mammography interpretation skills.",2322
37480549,Follow-up of liver metastases: a comparison of deep learning and RECIST 1.1.,European radiology,2023,"To compare liver metastases changes in CT assessed by radiologists using RECIST 1.1 and with aided simultaneous deep learning-based volumetric lesion changes analysis. A total of 86 abdominal CT studies from 43 patients (prior and current scans) of abdominal CT scans of patients with 1041 liver metastases (mean = 12.1, std = 11.9, range 1-49) were analyzed. Two radiologists performed readings of all pairs; conventional with RECIST 1.1 and with computer-aided assessment. For computer-aided reading, we used a novel simultaneous multi-channel 3D R2U-Net classifier trained and validated on other scans. The reference was established by having an expert radiologist validate the computed lesion detection and segmentation. The results were then verified and modified as needed by another independent radiologist. The primary outcome measure was the disease status assessment with the conventional and the computer-aided readings with respect to the reference. For conventional and computer-aided reading, there was a difference in disease status classification in 40 out of 86 (46.51%) and 10 out of 86 (27.9%) CT studies with respect to the reference, respectively. Computer-aided reading improved conventional reading in 30 CT studies by 34.5% for two readers (23.2% and 46.51%) with respect to the reference standard. The main reason for the difference between the two readings was lesion volume differences (p = 0.01). AI-based computer-aided analysis of liver metastases may improve the accuracy of the evaluation of neoplastic liver disease status. AI may aid radiologists to improve the accuracy of evaluating changes over time in metastasis of the liver. • Classification of liver metastasis changes improved significantly in one-third of the cases with an automatically generated comprehensive lesion and lesion changes report. • Simultaneous deep learning changes detection and volumetric assessment may improve the evaluation of liver metastases temporal changes potentially improving disease management.",2017
37478389,Prospective Correlation of Magnetic Resonance Tumor Regression Grade With Pathologic Outcomes in Total Neoadjuvant Therapy for Rectal Adenocarcinoma.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,2023,"Total neoadjuvant therapy (TNT) is a newly established standard treatment for rectal adenocarcinoma. Current methods to communicate magnitudes of regression during TNT are subjective and imprecise. Magnetic resonance tumor regression grade (MR-TRG) is an existing, but rarely used, regression grading system. Prospective validation of MR-TRG correlation with pathologic response in patients undergoing TNT is lacking. Utility of adding diffusion-weighted imaging to MR-TRG is also unknown. We conducted a multi-institutional prospective imaging substudy within NRG-GI002 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02921256) examining the ability of MR-based imaging to predict pathologic complete response (pCR) and correlate MR-TRG with the pathologic neoadjuvant response score (NAR). Serial MRIs were needed from 110 patients. Three radiologists independently, then collectively, reviewed each MRI for complete response (mriCR), which was tested for positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), sensitivity, and specificity with pCR. MR-TRG was examined for association with the pathologic NAR score. All team members were blinded to pathologic data. A total of 121 patients from 71 institutions met criteria: 28% were female (n = 34), 84% White (n = 101), and median age was 55 (24-78 years). Kappa scores for T- and N-stage after TNT were 0.38 and 0.88, reflecting fair agreement and near-perfect agreement, respectively. Calling an mriCR resulted in a kappa score of 0.82 after chemotherapy and 0.56 after TNT reflected near-perfect agreement and moderate agreement, respectively. MR-TRG scores were associated with pCR ( MRI alone is a poor tool to distinguish pCR in rectal adenocarcinoma undergoing TNT. However, the MR-TRG score presents a now validated method, correlated with pathologic NAR, which can objectively measure regression magnitude during TNT.",1879
37477673,Efficacy of exponentiation method with a convolutional neural network for classifying lung nodules on CT images by malignancy level.,European radiology,2023,"The aim of this study was to examine the performance of a convolutional neural network (CNN) combined with exponentiating each pixel value in classifying benign and malignant lung nodules on computed tomography (CT) images. Images in the Lung Image Database Consortium-Image Database Resource Initiative (LIDC-IDRI) were analyzed. Four CNN models were then constructed to classify the lung nodules by malignancy level (malignancy level 1 vs. 2, malignancy level 1 vs. 3, malignancy level 1 vs. 4, and malignancy level 1 vs. 5). The exponentiation method was applied for exponent values of 1.0 to 10.0 in increments of 0.5. Accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve of receiver operating characteristics (AUC-ROC) were calculated. These statistics were compared between an exponent value of 1.0 and all other exponent values in each model by the Mann-Whitney U-test. In malignancy 1 vs. 4, maximum test accuracy (MTA; exponent value = 2.0, 3.0, 3.5, 4.5, 5.0, 5.5, 6.0, 6.5, 7.0, 7.5, 8.0, 8.5, 9.0, 9.5, and 10.0) and specificity (6.5, 7.0, and 9.0) were improved by up to 0.012 and 0.037, respectively. In malignancy 1 vs. 5, MTA (6.5 and 7.0) and sensitivity (1.5) were improved by up to 0.030 and 0.0040, respectively. The exponentiation method improved the performance of the CNN in the task of classifying lung nodules on CT images as benign or malignant. The exponentiation method demonstrated two advantages: improved accuracy, and the ability to adjust sensitivity and specificity by selecting an appropriate exponent value. Adjustment of sensitivity and specificity by selecting an exponent value enables the construction of proper CNN models for screening, diagnosis, and treatment processes among patients with lung nodules. • The exponentiation method improved the performance of the convolutional neural network. • Contrast accentuation by the exponentiation method may derive features of lung nodules. • Sensitivity and specificity can be adjusted by selecting an exponent value.",2012
37477508,Single-Cell Characterization of Pulmonary Nodules Implicates Suppression of Immunosurveillance across Early Stages of Lung Adenocarcinoma.,Cancer research,2023,"A greater understanding of molecular, cellular, and immunological changes during the early stages of lung adenocarcinoma development could improve diagnostic and therapeutic approaches in patients with pulmonary nodules at risk for lung cancer. To elucidate the immunopathogenesis of early lung tumorigenesis, we evaluated surgically resected pulmonary nodules representing the spectrum of early lung adenocarcinoma as well as associated normal lung tissues using single-cell RNA sequencing and validated the results by flow cytometry and multiplex immunofluorescence (MIF). Single-cell transcriptomics revealed a significant decrease in gene expression associated with cytolytic activities of tumor-infiltrating natural killer and natural killer T cells. This was accompanied by a reduction in effector T cells and an increase of CD4+ regulatory T cells (Treg) in subsolid nodules. An independent set of resected pulmonary nodules consisting of both adenocarcinomas and associated premalignant lesions corroborated the early increment of Tregs in premalignant lesions compared with the associated normal lung tissues by MIF. Gene expression analysis indicated that cancer-associated alveolar type 2 cells and fibroblasts may contribute to the deregulation of the extracellular matrix, potentially affecting immune infiltration in subsolid nodules through ligand-receptor interactions. These findings suggest that there is a suppression of immune surveillance across the spectrum of early-stage lung adenocarcinoma. Analysis of a spectrum of subsolid pulmonary nodules by single-cell RNA sequencing provides insights into the immune regulation and cell-cell interactions in the tumor microenvironment during early lung tumor development.",1737
37470828,Hepatobiliary-phase gadolinium ethoxybenzyl-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid MRI for pretreatment prediction of efficacy-to-standard-therapies based on Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer algorithm: an up-to-date review.,European radiology,2023,"Recent advances in systemic therapy have had major impacts on treatment strategies for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The 2022 Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) guidelines incorporate a new section on clinical decision-making for personalized medicine, although the first treatment suggested by the BCLC guidelines is based on solid scientific evidence. More than ever before, the appropriate treatment strategy must be selected prior to the initiation of therapy for HCC. Gadolinium ethoxybenzyl-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid magnetic resonance imaging (Gd-EOB-DTPA-MRI) is essential for liver imaging and the hepatobiliary phase (HBP) of EOB-MRI reflects the expression of organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) transporters. Molecules associated with OATP expression are relevant in the molecular classification of HCC subclasses, and EOB-MRI is becoming increasingly important with advances in the molecular and genetic understanding of HCC. In this review, we describe imaging findings for the pretreatment prediction of response to standard therapies for HCC based on the BCLC algorithm using the HBP of EOB-MRI, with specific attention to the molecular background of OATPs. A more complete understanding of these findings will help radiologists suggest appropriate treatments and clinical follow-ups and could lead to the development of more personalized treatment strategies in the future. CLINICAL RELEVANCE STATEMENT: In the coming era of personalized medicine, HBP of EOB-MRI reflecting molecular and pathological factors could play a predictive role in the therapeutic efficacy of HCC and contribute to treatment selection. KEY POINTS: • Imaging features of hepatobiliary phase predict treatment efficacy prior to therapy and contribute to treatment choice. • Wnt/β-catenin activation associated with organic anion transporting polypeptide expression is involved in the tumor immune microenvironment and chemo-responsiveness. • Peritumoral hypointensity of hepatobiliary phase reflecting microvascular invasion affects the therapeutic efficacy of locoregional to systemic therapy.",2108
37470826,A machine learning model based on MRI for the preoperative prediction of bladder cancer invasion depth.,European radiology,2023,"To construct and validate a prediction model based on full-sequence MRI for preoperatively evaluating the invasion depth of bladder cancer. A total of 445 patients with bladder cancer were divided into a seven-to-three training set and test set for each group. The radiomic features of lesions were extracted automatically from the preoperative MRI images. Two feature selection methods were performed and compared, the key of which are the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) and the Max Relevance Min Redundancy (mRMR). The classifier of the prediction model was selected from six advanced machine-learning techniques. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and the area under the curve (AUC) were applied to assess the efficiency of the models. The models with the best performance for pathological invasion prediction and muscular invasion prediction consisted of LASSO as the feature selection method and random forest as the classifier. In the training set, the AUC of the pathological invasion model and muscular invasion model were 0.808 and 0.828. Furthermore, with the mRMR as the feature selection method, the external invasion model based on random forest achieved excellent discrimination (AUC, 0.857). The full-sequence models demonstrated excellent accuracy for preoperatively predicting the bladder cancer invasion status. This study introduces a full-sequence MRI model for preoperative prediction of the depth of bladder cancer infiltration, which could help clinicians to recognise pathological features associated with tumour infiltration prior to invasive procedures. • Full-sequence MRI prediction model performed better than Vesicle Imaging-Reporting and Data System (VI-RADS) for preoperatively evaluating the invasion status of bladder cancer. • Machine learning methods can extract information from T1-weighted image (T1WI) sequences and benefit bladder cancer invasion prediction.",1939
37466708,Differentiation of autoimmune pancreatitis from pancreatic adenocarcinoma using CT characteristics: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,European radiology,2023,"To determine informational CT findings for distinguishing autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP) from pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and to review their diagnostic accuracy. A systematic and detailed literature review was performed through PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane library. Similar descriptors to embody the identical image finding were labeled as a single CT characteristic. We calculated the pooled diagnostic odds ratios (DORs) of each CT characteristic using a bivariate random-effects model. A total of 145 various descriptors from 15 studies (including 562 AIP and 869 PDAC patients) were categorized into 16 CT characteristics. According to the pooled DOR, 16 CT characteristics were classified into three groups (suggesting AIP, suggesting PDAC, and not informational). Seven characteristics suggesting AIP were diffuse pancreatic enlargement (DOR, 48), delayed homogeneous enhancement (DOR, 46), capsule-like rim (DOR, 34), multiple pancreatic masses (DOR, 16), renal involvement (DOR, 15), retroperitoneal fibrosis (DOR, 13), and bile duct involvement (DOR, 8). Delayed homogeneous enhancement showed a pooled sensitivity of 83% and specificity of 85%. The other six characteristics showed relatively low sensitivity (12-63%) but high specificity (93-99%). Four characteristics suggesting PDAC were discrete pancreatic mass (DOR, 23), pancreatic duct cutoff (DOR, 16), upstream main pancreatic duct dilatation (DOR, 8), and upstream parenchymal atrophy (DOR, 7). Eleven CT characteristics were informational to distinguish AIP from PDAC. Diffuse pancreatic enlargement, delayed homogeneous enhancement, and capsule-like rim suggested AIP with the highest DORs, whereas discrete pancreatic mass suggested PDAC. However, pooled sensitivities of informational CT characteristics were moderate. This meta-analysis underscores eleven distinctive CT characteristics that aid in differentiating autoimmune pancreatitis from pancreatic adenocarcinoma, potentially preventing misdiagnoses in patients presenting with focal/diffuse pancreatic enlargement. • Diffuse pancreatic enlargement (pooled diagnostic odds ratio [DOR], 48), delayed homogeneous enhancement (46), and capsule-like rim (34) were CT characteristics suggesting autoimmune pancreatitis. • The CT characteristics suggesting autoimmune pancreatitis, except delayed homogeneous enhancement, had a general tendency to show relatively low sensitivity (12-63%) but high specificity (93-99%). • Discrete pancreatic mass (pooled diagnostic odds ratio, 23) was the CT characteristic suggesting pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma with the highest pooled DORs.",2623
37464112,Clinical utility of [,European radiology,2023,"The performance of positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) for the prediction of ypN2 disease in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) after neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy has not been reported. This multicenter study investigated the utility of PET/CT to assess ypN2 disease in these patients. A total of 181 consecutive patients (chemoimmunotherapy = 86, chemotherapy = 95) at four institutions were enrolled in this study. Every patient received a PET/CT scan prior to surgery and complete resection with systematic nodal dissection. The diagnostic performance was evaluated through area under the curve (AUC). Kaplan-Meier method and Cox analysis were performed to identify the risk factors affecting recurrences. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of PET/CT for ypN2 diseases were 0.667, 0.835, and 0.779, respectively. Therefore, the AUC was 0.751. Compared with the false positive cases, the mean value of max standardized uptake value (SUV PET/CT is an accurate and non-invasive test for mediastinal restaging of NSCLC patients who receive neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy. The ypN2 patients with PET/CT-N2( +) are identified as an independent prognostic factor compared with PET/CT-N2(-). Imaging with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) plays an integral role during disease diagnosis, staging, and therapeutic response assessments in patients with NSCLC. PET/CT could be an effective non-invasive tool for predicting ypN2 diseases after neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy. • PET/CT could serve as an effective non-invasive tool for predicting ypN2 diseases. • The ypN2 patients with PET/CT-N2( +) were a strong and independent prognostic factor. • The application of PET/CT for restaging should be encouraged in clinical practice.",1803
37464111,The combination of non-contrast abbreviated MRI and alpha foetoprotein has high performance for hepatocellular carcinoma screening.,European radiology,2023,"This study aimed to compare two abbreviated MRI (AMRI) protocols to complete MRI for HCC detection: non-contrast (NC)-AMRI without/with alpha foetoprotein (AFP) and dynamic contrast-enhanced (Dyn)-AMRI. This retrospective single-center study included 351 patients (M/F: 264/87, mean age: 57y) with chronic liver disease, who underwent MRI for HCC surveillance between 2014 and 2020. Two reconstructed AMRI sets were obtained based on complete MRI: NC-AMRI (T2-weighted imaging (WI) + diffusion-WI) and Dyn-AMRI (T2-WI + dynamic T1-WI) and were assessed by 2 radiologists who reported all suspicious lesions, using LI-RADS/adapted LI-RADS classification. The reference standard was based on all available patient data. Inter-reader agreement was assessed and MRI diagnostic performance was compared to the reference standard. The reference standard demonstrated 83/351 HCC-positive patients (prevalence: 23.6%, median size: 22 mm, and positive MRIs: 83/631). Inter-reader agreement was substantial for all sets. Sensitivities of Dyn-AMRI and complete MRI (both 92.8%) were similar, higher than NC-AMRI (72.3%, p < 0.001). Specificities were not different between sets. NC-AMRI + AFP (92.8%) had similar sensitivity to Dyn-AMRI and complete MRI. In patients with small size HCCs (≤ 2 cm), sensitivities of Dyn-AMRI (85.3%) and complete MRI (88.2%) remained similar (p = 0.564), also outperforming NC-AMRI (52.9%, p < 0.05). NC-AMRI + AFP had similar sensitivity (88.2%) to Dyn-AMRI and complete MRI (p = 0.706 and p = 1, respectively). Dyn-AMRI has similar diagnostic performance to complete MRI for HCC detection, while both outperform NC-AMRI, especially for small size HCCs. NC-AMRI + AFP demonstrates similar sensitivity to Dyn-AMRI and complete MRI. Due to the low sensitivity of ultrasound for hepatocellular screening, new screening methods are needed. Abbreviated MRI (AMRI) is a candidate, especially non-contrast AMRI with serum alpha foetoprotein as the acquisition time is low, without the need for contrast medium injection. • Dynamic contrast-enhanced abbreviated MRI using extracellular gadolinium-based contrast agent and complete MRI have similar diagnostic performance for hepatocellular carcinoma detection in an at-risk population. • Non-contrast abbreviated MRI with alpha foetoprotein has similar diagnostic performance to dynamic contrast-enhanced abbreviated MRI and complete MRI, including when considering small size hepatocellular carcinoma  ≤ 2 cm. • Non-contrast abbreviated MRI and dynamic contrast-enhanced abbreviated MRI can be performed in 7 and 10 min, excluding patient setup time.",2615
37462820,Diffusion-weighted imaging complements T2-weighted MRI for tumour response assessment in squamous anal carcinoma.,European radiology,2023,"A published tumour regression grade (TRG) score for squamous anal carcinoma treated with definitive chemoradiotherapy based on T2-weighted MRI yields a high proportion of indeterminate responses (TRG-3). We investigate whether the addition of diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) improves tumour response assessment in the early post treatment period. This retrospective observational study included squamous anal carcinoma patients undergoing MRI before and within 3 months of completing chemoradiotherapy from 2009 to 2020. Four independent radiologists (1-20 years' experience) scored MRI studies using a 5-point TRG system (1 = complete response; 5 = no response) based on T2-weighted sequences alone, and then after a 12-week washout period, using a 5-point DWI-TRG system based on T2-weighted and DWI. Scoring confidence was recorded on a 5-point scale (1 = low; 5 = high) for each reading and compared using the Wilcoxon test. Indeterminate scores (TRG-3) from each reading session were compared using the McNemar test. Interobserver agreement was assessed using kappa statistics. Eighty-five patients were included (mean age, 59 years ± 12 [SD]; 55 women). T2-weighted TRG-3 scores from all readers combined halved from 24% (82/340) to 12% (41/340) with DWI (p < 0.001). TRG-3 scores changed most frequently (41%, 34/82) to DWI-TRG-2 (excellent response). Complete tumour response was recorded clinically in 77/85 patients (91%). Scoring confidence increased using DWI (p < 0.001), with scores of 4 or 5 in 84% (287/340). Interobserver agreement remained fair to moderate (kappa range, 0.28-0.58). DWI complements T2-weighted MRI by reducing the number of indeterminate tumour responses (TRG-3). DWI increases radiologist's scoring confidence. Diffusion-weighted imaging improves T2-weighted tumour response assessment in squamous anal cancer, halving the number of indeterminate responses in the early post treatment period, and increases radiologists' confidence. Tumour response based on T2-weighted MRI is often indeterminate in squamous anal carcinoma. Diffusion-weighted imaging alongside T2-weighted MRI halved indeterminate tumour regression grade scores assigned by four radiologists from 24 to 12%. Scoring confidence of expert and non-expert radiologists increased with the inclusion of diffusion-weighted imaging.",2329
37462494,Efficacy and Safety of Half-Dose Gadopiclenol versus Full-Dose Gadobutrol for Contrast-enhanced Body MRI.,Radiology,2023,"Background Gadopiclenol is a macrocyclic gadolinium-based contrast agent (GBCA) with higher relaxivity compared with standard GBCAs, potentially allowing gadolinium dose reduction without decreasing efficacy. Purpose To investigate whether gadopiclenol at 0.05 mmol/kg is noninferior to gadobutrol at 0.1 mmol/kg for lesion visualization in body MRI. Materials and Methods A randomized, double-blind, crossover, phase 3 study was conducted between August 2019 and December 2020 at 33 centers in 11 countries. Adults with at least one suspected focal lesion in one of three different body regions (head and neck; breast, thorax, abdomen, or pelvis; or musculoskeletal system) underwent two contrast-enhanced MRI examinations, randomized to start with either gadopiclenol or gadobutrol. MRI examinations were read by three blinded expert readers for each respective body region. Readers rated border delineation, internal morphologic characteristics, and visual contrast enhancement. Three additional blinded readers assessed reader preference. For safety analysis, adverse events were recorded. The differences between gadopiclenol- and gadobutrol-enhanced MRI in terms of lesion visualization were analyzed with a generalized linear mixed model using a two-sided paired ",1270
37460801,US LI-RADS in surveillance for recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma after curative treatment.,European radiology,2023,"To investigate the performance of US LI-RADS in surveillance for recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma (RHCC) after curative treatment. This study enrolled 644 patients between January 2018 and August 2018 as a derivation cohort, and 397 patients from September 2018 to December 2018 as a validation cohort. The US surveillance after HCC curative treatment was performed. The US LI-RADS observation categories and visualization scores were analyzed. Four criteria using US LI-RADS or Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) as the surveillance algorithm were evaluated. The sensitivity, specificity, and negative predictive value (NPV) were calculated. A total of 212 (32.9%) patients in derivation cohort and 158 (39.8%) patients in validation cohort were detected to have RHCCs. The criterion of US-2/3 or AFP ≥ 20 µg/L had higher sensitivity (derivation, 96.7% vs 92.9% vs 81.1% vs 90.6%; validation, 96.2% vs 90.5% vs 80.4% vs 89.9%) and NPV (derivation, 95.7% vs 93.3% vs 88.0% vs 91.8%; validation, 94.6% vs 89.4% vs 83.6% vs 89.0%), but lower specificity (derivation, 35.9% vs 48.2% vs 67.6% vs 51.9%; validation, 43.5% vs 52.7% vs 66.1% vs 54.0%) than criterion of US-2/3, US-3, and US-3 or AFP ≥ 20 µg/L. Analysis of the visualization score subgroups confirmed that the sensitivity (89.2-97.6% vs 81.0-83.3%) and NPV(88.4-98.0% vs 80.0-83.3%) of score A and score B groups were higher than score C group in criterion of US-2/3 in both two cohorts. In the surveillance for RHCC, US LI-RADS with AFP had a high sensitivity and NPV when US-2/3 or AFP ≥ 20 µg/L was considered a criterion. The criterion of US-2/3 or AFP ≥ 20 µg/L improves sensitivity and NPV for RHCC surveillance, which provides a valuable reference for patients in RHCC surveillance after curative treatment. • US LI-RADS with AFP had high sensitivity and NPV in surveillance for RHCC when considering US-2/3 or AFP ≥ 20 µg/L as a criterion. • After US with AFP surveillance, patients with US-2/3 or AFP ≥ 20 µg/L should perform enhanced imaging for confirmative diagnosis. Patients with US-1 or AFP < 20 µg/L continue to repeat US with AFP surveillance. • Patients with risk factors for poor visualization scores limited the sensitivity of US surveillance in RHCC.",2221
37459457,Staging of Cervical Cancer: A Practical Approach Using MRI and FDG PET.,AJR. American journal of roentgenology,2023,"This review provides a practical approach to the imaging evaluation of patients with cervical cancer (CC), from initial diagnosis to restaging of recurrence, focusing on MRI and FDG PET. The primary updates to the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) CC staging system, as well as these updates' relevance to clinical management, are discussed. The recent literature investigating the role of MRI and FDG PET in CC staging and image-guided brachytherapy is summarized. The utility of MRI and FDG PET in response assessment and posttreatment surveillance is described. Important findings on MRI and FDG PET that interpreting radiologists should recognize and report are illustrated. The essential elements of structured reports during various phases of CC management are outlined. Special considerations, including the role of imaging in patients desiring fertility-sparing management, differentiation of CC and endometrial cancer, and unusual CC histologies, are also described.

We investigated, for the first time, the performance of three-dimensional (3D) and two-dimensional (2D) CNNs and dermatologists in the early detection of melanoma in a real-world setting. In this prospective study, 1690 melanocytic lesions in 143 patients with high-risk criteria for melanoma were evaluated by dermatologists, 2D-FotoFinder-ATBM and 3D-Vectra WB360 total body photography (TBP). Excision was based on the dermatologists' dichotomous decision, an elevated CNN risk score (study-specific malignancy cut-off: FotoFinder >0.5, Vectra >5.0) and/or the second dermatologist's assessment with CNN support. The diagnostic accuracy of the 2D and 3D CNN classification was compared with that of the dermatologists and the augmented intelligence based on histopathology and dermatologists' assessment. Secondary end-points included reproducibility of risk scores and naevus counts per patient by medical staff (gold standard) compared to automated 3D and 2D TBP CNN counts. The sensitivity, specificity, and receiver operating characteristics area under the curve (ROC-AUC) for risk-score-assessments compared to histopathology of 3D-CNN with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were 90.0%, 64.6% and 0.92 (CI 0.85-1.00), respectively. While dermatologists and augmented intelligence achieved the same sensitivity (90%) and comparable classification ROC-AUC (0.91 [CI 0.80-1.00], 0.88 [CI 0.77-1.00]) with 3D-CNN, their specificity was superior (92.3% and 86.2%, respectively). The 2D-CNN (sensitivity: 70%, specificity: 40%, ROC-AUC: 0.68 [CI 0.46-0.90]) was outperformed by 3D CNN and dermatologists. The 3D-CNN showed a higher correlation coefficient for repeated measurements of 246 lesions (R = 0.89) than the 2D-CNN (R = 0.79). The mean naevus count per patient varied significantly (gold standard: 210 lesions; 3D-CNN: 469; 2D-CNN: 1324; p < 0.0001). Our study emphasises the importance of validating the classification of CNNs in real life. The novel 3D-CNN device outperformed the 2D-CNN and achieved comparable sensitivity with dermatologists. The low specificity of CNNs and the lack of automated counting of TBP nevi currently limit the use of augmented intelligence in clinical practice.",2337
37452176,Development and multicenter validation of a multiparametric imaging model to predict treatment response in rectal cancer.,European radiology,2023,"To develop and validate a multiparametric model to predict neoadjuvant treatment response in rectal cancer at baseline using a heterogeneous multicenter MRI dataset. Baseline staging MRIs (T2W (T2-weighted)-MRI, diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) / apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC)) of 509 patients (9 centres) treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (CRT) were collected. Response was defined as (1) complete versus incomplete response, or (2) good (Mandard tumor regression grade (TRG) 1-2) versus poor response (TRG3-5). Prediction models were developed using combinations of the following variable groups: (1) Non-imaging: age/sex/tumor-location/tumor-morphology/CRT-surgery interval (2) Basic staging: cT-stage/cN-stage/mesorectal fascia involvement, derived from (2a) original staging reports, or (2b) expert re-evaluation (3) Advanced staging: variables from 2b combined with cTN-substaging/invasion depth/extramural vascular invasion/tumor length (4) Quantitative imaging: tumour volume + first-order histogram features (from T2W-MRI and DWI/ADC) Models were developed with data from 6 centers (n = 412) using logistic regression with the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selector Operator (LASSO) feature selection, internally validated using repeated (n = 100) random hold-out validation, and externally validated using data from 3 centers (n = 97). After external validation, the best model (including non-imaging and advanced staging variables) achieved an area under the curve of 0.60 (95%CI=0.48-0.72) to predict complete response and 0.65 (95%CI=0.53-0.76) to predict a good response. Quantitative variables did not improve model performance. Basic staging variables consistently achieved lower performance compared to advanced staging variables. Overall model performance was moderate. Best results were obtained using advanced staging variables, highlighting the importance of good-quality staging according to current guidelines. Quantitative imaging features had no added value (in this heterogeneous dataset). Predicting tumour response at baseline could aid in tailoring neoadjuvant therapies for rectal cancer. This study shows that image-based prediction models are promising, though are negatively affected by variations in staging quality and MRI acquisition, urging the need for harmonization. This multicenter study combining clinical information and features derived from MRI rendered disappointing performance to predict response to neoadjuvant treatment in rectal cancer. Best results were obtained with the combination of clinical baseline information and state-of-the-art image-based staging variables, highlighting the importance of good quality staging according to current guidelines and staging templates. No added value was found for quantitative imaging features in this multicenter retrospective study. This is likely related to acquisition variations, which is a major problem for feature reproducibility and thus model generalizability.",2978
37451182,Treatment outcome of patients with synchronous oligometastatic non-small cell lung cancer in the immunotherapy era: Analysis of a real-life intention-to-treat population.,"European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",2023,"The standard first-line treatment for non-oncogene driven metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is an immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) based strategy. Although guidelines increasingly advise adding local radical treatment (LRT) to patients with synchronous oligometastatic (sOMD) NSCLC responding to systemic therapy, this recommendation is based on the studies without ICI. Furthermore, the majority of published oligometastatic studies were not on an intention-to-treat basis, resulting in selection bias. Moreover, staging Positron Emission Tomography-Computed Tomography (PET-CT) and brain imaging were often not mandatory and definitions of oligometastatic were heterogeneous. Therefore, this study focused on a single centre retrospective series, including all adequately staged patients with sOMD NSCLC according to the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer definition (maximum of 5 metastases in 3 organs) that were treated with induction (chemo)-ICI and compared outcomes to those treated with chemotherapy only, with and without LRT. The primary end-points were median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) for patients treated with induction (chemo)-ICI versus chemotherapy. Out of 68 included patients, 38 (56%) eventually received LRT. With a median follow-up of 26.7 months, the median PFS was 19.0 months for (chemo)-ICI (n = 18) versus 6.8 for chemotherapy-only (n = 50) (HR 0.5, p = 0.03), the median OS was 19.3 versus 15.7 months, respectively (HR 0.8, p = 0.4). In patients having received LRT, median PFS was 19.0 months for (chemo)-ICI versus 8.3 for chemotherapy-only (HR 0.6, p = 0.2). In conclusion, an ICI-based systemic treatment is feasible and may result in superior survival outcomes. This should be investigated in prospective trials. Strategies to improve response rates to systemic treatment are also needed.",1891

This twin-centre retrospective study included 95 locally advanced thyroid cancer patients from the 1 In the training cohort, compromised RLN (p < 0.001), trachea (p = 0.001), oesophagus (p = 0.002), artery (p < 0.001), vein (p = 0.005), and soft tissue (p < 0.001) were predictors for unresectability, while compromised larynx (p = 0.283) was not. The 12-score scale (AUC = 0.882, 95%CI: 0.812-0.952) was not inferior to the 14-score scale (AUC = 0.891, 95%CI: 0.823-0.960). In subgroup analysis, the AUCs of the 12-score scale were 0.826 for treatment-naïve patients and 0.976 for patients with prior surgery. The 12-score scale was further validated with a fivefold cross-validation analysis, with an overall accuracy of 78.9-89.4%. Finally, external validation using the testing cohort showed an AUC of 0.875. The researchers built a CT-based 12-score scale to evaluate the resectability of locally advanced thyroid cancer. Validation with a larger sample size is required to confirm the efficacy of the scale. This 12-score CT scale would help clinicians evaluate the resectability of locally advanced thyroid cancer. • The researchers built a 12-score CT scale (including recurrent laryngeal nerve, trachea, oesophagus, artery, vein, and soft tissue) to evaluate the resectability of locally advanced thyroid cancer. • This scale has the potential to help clinicians make treatment plans for locally advanced thyroid cancer.",1547
37439938,MR dynamic-susceptibility-contrast perfusion metrics in the presurgical discrimination of adult solitary intra-axial cerebellar tumors.,European radiology,2023,"Adult solitary intra-axial cerebellar tumors are uncommon. Their presurgical differentiation based on neuroimaging is crucial, since management differs substantially. Comprehensive full assessment of MR dynamic-susceptibility-contrast perfusion-weighted imaging (DSC-PWI) may reveal key differences between entities. This study aims to provide new insights on perfusion patterns of these tumors and to explore the potential of DSC-PWI in their presurgical discrimination. Adult patients with a solitary cerebellar tumor on presurgical MR and confirmed histological diagnosis of metastasis, medulloblastoma, hemangioblastoma, or pilocytic astrocytoma were retrospectively retrieved (2008-2023). Volumetric segmentation of tumors and normal-appearing white matter (for normalization) was semi-automatically performed on CE-T1WI and coregistered with DSC-PWI. Mean normalized values per patient tumor-mask of relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV), percentage of signal recovery (PSR), peak height (PH), and normalized time-intensity curves (nTIC) were extracted. Statistical comparisons were done. Then, the dataset was split into training (75%) and test (25%) cohorts and a classifier was created considering nTIC, rCBV, PSR, and PH in the model. Sixty-eight patients (31 metastases, 13 medulloblastomas, 13 hemangioblastomas, and 11 pilocytic astrocytomas) were included. Relevant differences between tumor types' nTICs were demonstrated. Hemangioblastoma showed the highest rCBV and PH, pilocytic astrocytoma the highest PSR. All parameters showed significant differences on the Kruskal-Wallis tests (p < 0.001). The classifier yielded an accuracy of 98% (47/48) in the training and 85% (17/20) in the test sets. Intra-axial cerebellar tumors in adults have singular and significantly different DSC-PWI signatures. The combination of perfusion metrics through data-analysis rendered excellent accuracies in discriminating these entities. In this study, the authors constructed a classifier for the non-invasive imaging presurgical diagnosis of adult intra-axial cerebellar tumors. The resultant tool can be a support for decision-making in the clinical practice and enables optimal personalized patient management. • Adult intra-axial cerebellar tumors exhibit specific, singular, and statistically significant different MR dynamic-susceptibility-contrast perfusion-weighted imaging (DSC-PWI) signatures. • Data-analysis, applied to MR DSC-PWI, could provide added value in the presurgical diagnosis of solitary cerebellar metastasis, medulloblastoma, hemangioblastoma, and pilocytic astrocytoma. • A classifier based on DSC-PWI metrics yields excellent accuracy rates and could be used as a support tool for radiologic diagnosis with clinician-friendly displays.",2763
37439936,Model incorporating multiple diffusion MRI features: development and validation of a radiomics-based model to predict adult-type diffuse gliomas grade.,European radiology,2023,"To develop and validate a radiomics-based model (ADGGIP) for predicting adult-type diffuse gliomas (ADG) grade by combining multiple diffusion modalities and clinical and imaging morphologic features. In this prospective study, we recruited 103 participants diagnosed with ADG and collected their preoperative conventional MRI and multiple diffusion imaging (diffusion tensor imaging, diffusion kurtosis imaging, neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging, and mean apparent propagator diffusion-MRI) data in our hospital, as well as clinical information. Radiomic features of the diffusion images and clinical information and morphological data from the radiological reports were extracted, and multiple pipelines were used to construct the optimal model. Model validation was performed through a time-independent validation cohort. ROC curves were used to evaluate model performance. The clinical benefit was determined by decision curve analysis. From June 2018 to May 2021, 72 participants were recruited for the training cohort. Between June 2021 and February 2022, 31 participants were enrolled in the prospective validation cohort. In the training cohort (AUC 0.958), internal validation cohort (0.942), and prospective validation cohort (0.880), ADGGIP had good accuracy in predicting ADG grade. ADGGIP was also significantly better than the single-modality prediction model (AUC 0.860) and clinical imaging morphology model (0.841) (all p < .01) in the prospective validation cohort. When the threshold probability was greater than 5%, ADGGIP provided the greatest net benefit. ADGGIP, which is based on advanced diffusion modalities, can predict the grade of ADG with high accuracy and robustness and can help improve clinical decision-making. Integrated multi-modal predictive modeling is beneficial for early detection and treatment planning of adult-type diffuse gliomas, as well as for investigating the genuine clinical significance of biomarkers. • Integrated model exhibits the highest performance and stability. • When the threshold is greater than 5%, the integrated model has the greatest net benefit. • The advanced diffusion models do not demonstrate better performance than the simple technology.",2227

37439934,Improved performance of non-preloaded and high flip-angle dynamic susceptibility contrast perfusion-weighted imaging sequences in the presurgical differentiation of brain lymphoma and glioblastoma.,European radiology,2023,"This study aimed to compare the accuracy of relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) and percentage signal recovery (PSR) obtained from high flip-angle dynamic susceptibility contrast perfusion-weighted imaging (DSC-PWI) sequences with and without contrast agent (CA) preload for presurgical discrimination of brain glioblastoma and lymphoma. Consecutive 336 patients (glioblastoma, 236; PCNSL, 100) were included. All the patients underwent DSC-PWI on 3.0-T magnetic resonance units before surgery. The rCBV and PSR with preloaded and non-preloaded CA were measured. The means of the continuous variables were compared using Welch's t-test. The diagnostic accuracies of the individual parameters were compared using the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. The rCBV was higher with preloaded CA than with non-preloaded CA (glioblastoma, 10.20 vs. 8.90, p = 0.020; PCNSL, 3.88 vs. 3.27, p = 0.020). The PSR was lower with preloaded CA than with non-preloaded CA (glioblastoma, 0.59 vs. 0.90; PCNSL, 0.70 vs. 1.63; all p < 0.001). Regarding the differentiation of glioblastoma and PCNSL, the AUC of rCBV with preloaded CA was indistinguishable from that of non-preloaded CA (0.940 vs. 0.949, p = 0.703), whereas the area under the curve of PSR with preloaded CA was lower than non-preloaded CA (0.529 vs. 0.884, p < 0.001). With preloaded CA, diagnostic performance in differentiating glioblastoma and PCNSL did not improve for rCBV and it was decreased for PSR. Therefore, high flip-angle non-preload DSC-PWI sequences offer excellent accuracy and may be of choice sequence for presurgical discrimination of brain lymphoma and glioblastoma. High flip-angle DSC-PWI using non-preloaded CA may be an excellent diagnostic method for distinguishing glioblastoma from PCNSL. • Differentiating primary central nervous system lymphoma and glioblastoma accurately is critical for their management. • DSC-PWI sequences optimised for the most accurate CBV calculations may not be the optimal sequences for presurgical brain tumour diagnosis as they could be masquerading leakage phenomena that may provide interesting information in terms of differential diagnosis. • High flip-angle non-preloaded DSC-PWI sequences render the best accuracy in the presurgical differentiation of brain lymphoma and glioblastoma.",2311
37439933,Diagnostic accuracy of CT and MR features for detecting atypical lipomatous tumors and malignant liposarcomas: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,European radiology,2023,"This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of CT and MRI for differentiating atypical lipomatous tumors and malignant liposarcomas from benign lipomatous lesions. MEDLINE, EMBASE, Scopus, the Cochrane Library, and the gray literature from inception to January 2022 were systematically evaluated. Original studies with > 5 patients evaluating the accuracy of CT and/or MRI for detecting liposarcomas with a histopathological reference standard were included. Meta-analysis was performed using a bivariate mixed-effects regression model. Risk of bias was evaluated using Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2 (QUADAS-2). This study is registered on PROSPERO, number CRD42022306479. Twenty-six studies with a total of 2613 patients were included. Mean/median reported patient ages ranged between 50 and 63 years. The summary sensitivity and specificity of radiologist gestalt for detecting liposarcomas was 85% (79-90% 95% CI) and 63% (52-72%), respectively. Deep depth to fascia, thickened septations, enhancing components, and lesion size (≥ 10 cm) all demonstrated sensitivities ≥ 85%. Other imaging characteristics including heterogenous/amorphous signal intensity, irregular tumor margin, and nodules present demonstrated lower sensitivities ranging from 43 to 65%. Inter-reader reliability for radiologist gestalt within studies ranged from fair to substantial (k = 0.23-0.7). Risk of bias was predominantly mixed for patient selection, low for index test and reference standard, and unclear for flow and timing. Higher sensitivities for detecting liposarcomas were achieved with radiologist gestalt, deep depth to fascia, thickened septations, enhancing components, and large size. Combined clinical and imaging scoring and/or radiomics both show promise for optimal performance, though require further analysis with prospective study designs. This pooled analysis evaluates the accuracy of CT and MRI for detecting atypical lipomatous tumors and malignant liposarcomas. Radiologist gestalt, deep depth to fascia, thickened septations, enhancing components, and large size demonstrate the highest overall sensitivities. • The summary sensitivity and specificity of radiologist gestalt for detecting liposarcomas was 85% (79-90% 95% CI) and 63% (52-72%), respectively. • Radiologist gestalt, deep depth to fascia, thickened septations, enhancing components, and large tumor size (≥ 10 cm) showed the highest sensitivities for detecting atypical lipomatous tumors/well-differentiated liposarcomas and malignant liposarcomas. • A combined clinical and imaging scoring system and/or radiomics is likely to provide the best overall diagnostic accuracy, although currently proposed scoring systems and radiomic feature analysis require further study with prospective study designs.",2825

Patients were retrospectively enrolled from two institutions for the constitution of training (n = 69) and validation (n = 31) cohorts with a median follow-up of 15 months. A total of 396 radiomics features were extracted from each baseline CT image. Features selected by variable importance and minimal depth were used for random survival forest model construction. The performance of the model was assessed using the concordance index (C-index), calibration curves, integrated discrimination index (IDI), net reclassification index (NRI), and decision curve analysis. Type of PVTT and tumor number were proved to be significant clinical indicators for OS. Arterial phase images were used to extract radiomics features. Three radiomics features were selected for model construction. The C-index for the radiomics model was 0.759 in the training cohort and 0.730 in the validation cohort. To improve the predictive performance, clinical indicators were integrated into the radiomics model to form a combined model with a C-index of 0.814 in the training cohort and 0.792 in the validation cohort. The IDI was significant in both cohorts for the combined model versus the radiomics model in predicting 12-month OS. Type of PVTT and tumor number affected the OS of HCC patients with PVTT treated with DEB-TACE. Moreover, the combined clinical-radiomics model had a satisfactory performance. A CT-based radiomics nomogram, which consisted of 3 radiomics features and 2 clinical indicators, was recommended to predict 12-month overall survival of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and portal vein tumor thrombus initially treated with drug-eluting beads transarterial chemoembolization. • Type of portal vein tumor thrombus and tumor number were significant predictors of the OS. • Integrated discrimination index and net reclassification index provided a quantitative evaluation of the incremental impact added by new indicators for the radiomics model. • A nomogram based on a radiomics signature and clinical indicators showed satisfactory performance in predicting OS after DEB-TACE.",2349

A total of 542 patients with clinical stage 0-I peripheral LUAD and with preoperative CT data of 1-mm slice thickness were included. Maximal solid size on axial image (MSSA) was evaluated by two chest radiologists. MSSA, volume of solid component (SV), and mass of solid component (SM) were evaluated by DL. Consolidation-to-tumor ratios (CTRs) were calculated. For ground glass nodules (GGNs), solid parts were extracted with different density level thresholds. The prognosis prediction efficacy of DL was compared with that of manual measurements. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards model was used to find independent risk factors. The prognosis prediction efficacy of T-staging (TS) measured by radiologists was inferior to that of DL. For GGNs, MSSA-based CTR measured by radiologists ( DL algorithm can replace human for more accurate T-staging of LUAD.

A noninvasive quantitative measure of intratumoral heterogeneity (ITH) may be valuable for predicting treatment response. Purpose To develop a quantitative measure of ITH on pretreatment MRI scans and test its performance for predicting pathologic complete response (pCR) after NAC in patients with breast cancer. Materials and Methods Pretreatment MRI scans were retrospectively acquired in patients with breast cancer who received NAC followed by surgery at multiple centers from January 2000 to September 2020. Conventional radiomics (hereafter, C-radiomics) and intratumoral ecological diversity features were extracted from the MRI scans, and output probabilities of imaging-based decision tree models were used to generate a C-radiomics score and ITH index. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to identify variables associated with pCR, and significant variables, including clinicopathologic variables, C-radiomics score, and ITH index, were combined into a predictive model for which performance was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC).

37414883,Prediction of occult peritoneal metastases or positive cytology using CT in gastric cancer.,European radiology,2023,"Accurate prediction of preoperative occult peritoneal metastasis (OPM) is critical to selecting appropriate therapeutic regimen for gastric cancer (GC). Considering the clinical practicability, we develop and validate a visible nomogram that integrates the CT images and clinicopathological parameters for the individual preoperative prediction of OPM in GC. This retrospective study included 520 patients who underwent staged laparoscopic exploration or peritoneal lavage cytology (PLC) examination. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression results were used to screen model predictors and construct nomograms of OPM risk. The performance of the model was detected by using ROC, accuracy, and C-index. The bootstrap resampling method was considered internal validation of the model. The Delong test was used to evaluate the difference in AUC between the two models. Grade 2 mural stratification, tumor thickness, and the Lauren classification diffuse were significant predictors of OPM (p < 0.05). The nomogram of these three factors (compared with the original model) showed a higher predictive effect (p < 0.001). The area under the curve (AUC) of the model was 0.830 (95% CI 0.788-0.873), and the internally validated AUC of 1000 bootstrap samples was 0.826 (95% CI 0.756-0.870). The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were 76.0%, 78.8%, and 78.3%, respectively. CT phenotype-based nomogram demonstrates favorable discrimination and calibration, and it can be conveniently used for preoperative individual risk rating of OPM in GC. In this study, the preoperative OPM prediction model based on CT images (mural stratification, tumor thickness) combined with pathological parameters (the Lauren classification) showed excellent predictive ability in GC, and it is also suitable for clinicians to use rather than limited to professional radiologists. • Nomogram based on CT image analysis can effectively predict occult peritoneal metastasis in gastric cancer (training area under the curve (AUC) = 0.830 and bootstrap AUC = 0.826). • Nomogram model combined with CT features performed better than the original model (established using only clinicopathological parameters) in differentiating occult peritoneal metastasis of gastric cancer.",2252
37405505,Pretreatment dual-energy CT for predicting early response to induction chemotherapy and survival in nasopharyngeal carcinoma.,European radiology,2023,"To evaluate the predictive performance of pretreatment dual-energy CT (DECT) for early response to induction chemotherapy and survival in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). In this retrospective study, 56 NPC patients who underwent pretreatment DECT scans with posttreatment follow-up were enrolled. The DECT-derived normalised iodine concentration (nIC), effective atomic number (Zeff), 40-180 keV (20 keV interval), and Mix-0.3 value of the tumour lesions were measured to predict the early response to induction chemotherapy and survival in nasopharyngeal carcinoma. The Mann‒Whitney U test, ROC analysis, Kaplan‒Meier method with log-rank test, and Cox proportional hazards model were performed to evaluate the predictive performance of DECT parameters, respectively. Among all DECT-derived parameters, ROC analysis showed the predictive performances of nIC and Zeff values for early objective response to induction chemotherapy (AUCs of 0.803 and 0.826), locoregional failure-free survival (AUCs of 0.786 and 0.767), progression-free survival (AUCs of 0.856 and 0.731) and overall survival (AUCs of 0.765 and 0.799) in NPC patients, respectively (all p < 0.05). Moreover, multivariate analysis showed that a high nIC value was an independent predictor of poor survival in NPC. In addition, survival analysis indicated that NPC patients with higher nIC values in primary tumours tend to have lower 5-year locoregional failure-free survival, progression-free survival and overall survival rates than those with lower nIC values. DECT-derived nIC and Zeff values can predict early response to induction chemotherapy and survival in NPC; in particular, a high nIC value is an independent predictive factor of poor survival in NPC. Preoperative dual-energy computed tomography may provide predictive value for early response and survival outcomes in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and facilitate their clinical management. • Pretreatment dual-energy computed tomography helps to predict early response to therapy and survival in NPC. • NIC and Zeff values derived from dual-energy computed tomography can predict early objective response to induction chemotherapy and survival in NPC. • A high nIC value is an independent predictive factor of poor survival in NPC.",2270
37405502,Contrast enhancement early after renal malignancy cryoablation: imaging findings associated with benignity.,European radiology,2023,"Contrast enhancement by MRI done early after cryoablation for renal malignancies may suggest residual tumor (RT). However, we have observed MRI enhancement within 48 h of cryoablation in patients who had no contrast enhancement 6 weeks later. Our purpose was to identify features of 48-h contrast enhancement in patients without RT. This single-center retrospective study included consecutive patients who underwent percutaneous cryoablation of renal malignancies in 2013-2020, exhibited cryoablation-zone MRI contrast enhancement 48 h later, and had available 6-week MRI scans. Persistent or growing CE at 6 weeks vs. 48 h was classified as RT. A washout index was calculated for each 48-h MRI, and its performance for predicting RT was assessed by receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. We included 60 patients with 72 cryoablation procedures and 83 cryoablation zones exhibiting 48-h contrast enhancement; mean age was 66 ± 17 years. Clear-cell renal cell carcinoma accounted for 95% of tumors. Of the 83 48-h enhancement zones, RT was observed in eight while 75 were benign. The 48-h enhancement was consistently visible at the arterial phase. Washout was significantly associated with RT (p < 0.001) and gradually increasing contrast enhancement with benignity (p < 0.009). A washout index below  - 1.1 predicted RT with 88% sensitivity and 84% specificity. MRI contrast enhancement 48 h after cryoablation of renal malignancies was usually benign. Washout was associated with residual tumor, with a washout index value below  - 1.1 exhibiting good performance in predicting residual tumor. These findings may help to guide decisions about repeat cryoablation. Magnetic resonance imaging contrast enhancement 48 h after cryoablation of renal malignancies rarely indicates residual tumor, which is characterized by washout with a washout index lower than  - 1.1. • Contrast enhancement at the arterial phase of magnetic resonance imaging done 48 h after cryoablation of a renal malignancy is usually benign. • Residual tumor manifesting as contrast enhancement at the arterial phase is characterized by subsequent marked washout. • A washout index below  - 1.1 has 88% sensitivity and 84% specificity for residual tumor.",2235

In total, 245 liver nodules assigned to LR-3/4 in 192 patients from January 2010 to December 2016 were followed up by baseline US and CEUS. The differences in the rate and time of progression to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) among subcategories (defined as P1-P7) of LR-3/4 in CEUS Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System (LI-RADS) were analyzed. The risk factors to predict progression to HCC were analyzed by univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard model analysis. A total of 40.3% of LR-3 nodules and 78.9% of LR-4 nodules eventually progressed to HCC. The cumulative incidence of progression was significantly higher for LR-4 than LR-3 (p < 0.001). The rate of progression was 81.2% in nodules with arterial phase hyperenhancement (APHE), 64.7% in nodules with late and mild washout, and 100% in nodules with both characteristics. The overall progression rate and median progression time of subcategory P1 nodules (LR-3a) were lower (38.0% vs. 47.6-100.0%) and later (25.1 months vs. 2.0-16.3 months) than those of other subcategories. The cumulative incidence of progression of LR-3a (P1), LR-3b (P2/3/4), and LR-4 (P5/6/7) categories were 38.0%, 52.9%, and 78.9%. The risk factors of HCC progression were Visualization score B/C, CEUS characteristics (APHE, washout), LR-4 classification, echo changes, and definite growth. CEUS is a useful surveillance tool for nodules at risk of HCC. CEUS characteristics, LI-RADS classification, and changes in nodules provide useful information for the progress of LR-3/4 nodules. CEUS characteristics, LI-RADS classification, and nodule changes provide important predictions for LR-3/4 nodule progression to HCC, which may stratify the risk of malignant progression to provide a more optimized and refined, more cost-effective, and time-efficient management strategy for patients. • CEUS is a useful surveillance tool for nodules at risk of HCC, CEUS LI-RADS successfully stratified the risks that progress to HCC. • CEUS characteristics, LI-RADS classification, and changes in nodules can provide important information on the progression of LR-3/4 nodules, which may be helpful for a more optimized and refined management strategy.",2340

This retrospective study included 1049 patients with 1082 lesions from two independent hospitals that were pathologically confirmed as HCC or non-HCC. All patients underwent a four-phase CT imaging protocol. All lesions were graded (LR 4/5/M) by radiologists and divided into an internal (n = 886) and external cohort (n = 196) based on the examination date. In the internal cohort, Swin-Transformer based on different CT protocols were trained and tested for their ability to LI-RADS grading and distinguish HCC from non-HCC, and then validated in the external cohort. We further developed a combined model with the optimal protocol and clinical information for distinguishing HCC from non-HCC. In the test and external validation cohorts, the three-phase protocol without pre-contrast showed κ values of 0.6094 and 0.4845 for LI-RADS grading, and its accuracy was 0.8371 and 0.8061, while the accuracy of the radiologist was 0.8596 and 0.8622, respectively.

A total of 366 patients (263 in the training cohort, 103 in the validation cohort) who underwent MRI examination with pathologically proven either IMCC or CRLM from two centers were included. Twenty-eight MRI features were collected. Univariate analyses and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to identify independent predictors for distinguishing IMCC from solitary CRLM. The independent predictors were weighted over based on regression coefficients to build a scoring system. The overall score distribution was divided into three groups to show the diagnostic probability of CRLM. Six independent predictors, including hepatic capsular retraction, peripheral hepatic enhancement, vessel penetrating the tumor, upper abdominal lymphadenopathy, peripheral washout at the portal venous phase, and rim enhancement at the portal venous phase were included in the system.

This study evaluated the quantitative data derived from dual-layer spectral detector CT (DLCT) for preoperative diagnosis of metastatic LNs compared to conventional CT images. Patients with adenocarcinoma scheduled for gastrectomy were enrolled in this prospective study from July, 2021, to February, 2022. Regional LNs were labeled on preoperative DLCT. The LNs were located and matched using carbon nanoparticle solution during surgery according to their locations and anatomic landmarks on preoperative images. The matched LNs were randomly split into training and validation cohorts in a ratio of 2:1. The DLCT quantitative parameters in the training cohort were investigated using logistic regression models to identify independent predictors of metastatic LNs, and these predictors were subsequently applied to the validation cohort. Receiver operating characteristic curves were compared between the DLCT parameters and conventional CT images. Fifty-five patients were included in the study, with 267 successfully matched LNs (90 metastatic, 177 nonmetastatic). Independent predictors included arterial phase CT attenuation on 70-keV images, venous phase electron density, and clustered feature. These combination predictors had areas under the curve (AUC) of 0.855 and 0.907 in the training and validation cohorts, respectively. Compared to conventional CT criteria alone, the model had higher AUC and accuracy (0.741 vs. 0.907, 75.28% vs. 87.64%; p < 0.01) for LN diagnosis. Incorporating DLCT parameters improved preoperative diagnosis of LN metastasis in GC, increasing the accuracy of clinical N stage.

37386299,Upgrade risk of image-targeted radial scar and complex sclerosing lesions diagnosed at needle-guided biopsy: a retrospective study.,European radiology,2023,"To determine the upgrade rate of radial scar (RS) and complex sclerosing lesions (CSL) diagnosed with percutaneous biopsy. The secondary objectives were to determine the new atypia rate after surgery and to assess the diagnosis of subsequent malignancy on follow-up. This single-institution retrospective study had IRB approval. All image-targeted RS and CSL diagnosed with percutaneous biopsy between 2007 and 2020 were reviewed. Patient demographics, imaging presentation, biopsy characteristics, histological report, and follow-up data were collected. During the study period, 120 RS/CSL were diagnosed in 106 women (median age, 43.5 years; range, 23-74), and 101 lesions were analyzed. At biopsy, 91 (90.1%) lesions were not associated with another atypia or malignancy and 10 (9.9%) were associated with another atypia. Out of the 91 lesions that were not associated with malignancy or atypia, 75 (82.4%) underwent surgical excision, and one upgrade to low-grade CDIS was detected (1.3%). Among the 10 lesions initially associated with another atypia, 9 were surgically excised and no malignancy was detected. After a median follow-up of 47 months (range: 12-143 months), two (1.98%) developed malignancy in a different quadrant; in both cases, another atypia was present at biopsy. We found a low upgrade rate on image-detected RS/CSL, with or without another atypia associated. Associated atypia was underdiagnosed at biopsy in almost one-third of cases. Subsequent cancer risk could not be established because the only two cases were associated with another high-risk lesion (HRL), which might have increased the patient's risk of developing malignancy. Our upgrade rates of RS/CSL with or without atypia diagnosed with core needle biopsy are almost as low as the ones reported with larger sampling methods. This result has particular importance in places with limited accessibility to US-guided vacuum-assisted biopsy. •New evidence is showing lower upgrade rates of RS and CSL after surgery, leading to a more conservative management with extensive sampling using VAB or VAE. •Our study showed only one upgrade to a low-grade DCIS after surgery, yielding an upgrade rate of 1.33%. •During follow-up, no new malignancy was detected in the same quadrant where RS/CSL was diagnosed, including patients without surgery.",2325
37382619,Risk prediction of intraoperative pain in percutaneous microwave ablation of lung tumors under CT guidance.,European radiology,2023,"To evaluate the effect of intraoperative pain in microwave ablation of lung tumors (MWALT) on local efficacy and establish the pain risk prediction model. It was a retrospectively study. Consecutive patients with MWALT from September 2017 to December 2020 were divided into mild and severe pain groups. Local efficacy was evaluated by comparing technical success, technical effectiveness, and local progression-free survival (LPFS) in two groups. All cases were randomly allocated into training and validation cohorts at a ratio of 7:3. A nomogram model was established using predictors identified by logistics regression in training dataset. The calibration curves, C-statistic, and decision curve analysis (DCA) were used to evaluate the accuracy, ability, and clinical value of the nomogram. A total of 263 patients (mild pain group: n = 126; severe pain group: n = 137) were included in the study. Technical success rate and technical effectiveness rate were 100% and 99.2% in the mild pain group and 98.5% and 97.8% in the severe pain group. LPFS rates at 12 and 24 months were 97.6% and 87.6% in the mild pain group and 91.9% and 79.3% in the severe pain group (p = 0.034; HR: 1.90). The nomogram was established based on three predictors: depth of nodule, puncture depth, and multi-antenna. The prediction ability and accuracy were verified by C-statistic and calibration curve. DCA curve suggested the proposed prediction model was clinically useful. Severe intraoperative pain in MWALT reduced the local efficacy. An established prediction model could accurately predict severe pain and assist physicians in choosing a suitable anesthesia type. This study firstly provides a prediction model for the risk of severe intraoperative pain in MWALT. Physicians can choose a suitable anesthesia type based on pain risk, in order to improve patients' tolerance as well as local efficacy of MWALT. • The severe intraoperative pain in MWALT reduced the local efficacy. • Predictors of severe intraoperative pain in MWALT were the depth of nodule, puncture depth, and multi-antenna. • The prediction model established in this study can accurately predict the risk of severe pain in MWALT and assist physicians in choosing a suitable anesthesia type.",2248

In this retrospective study, pre-operative contrasted T1-weighted and T2-weighted MR images were obtained from patients with gliomas from three centers: Jinling Hospital, Tiantan Hospital, and the Cancer Genome Atlas Program. Based on CLLA and ROI-based radiomic analyses, a fusion location-radiomics model was constructed to predict tumor grades, isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) status, and overall survival (OS). An inter-site cross-validation strategy was used for assessing the performances of the fusion model on accuracy and generalization with the value of area under the curve (AUC) and delta accuracy (ACC) (ACC A total of 679 patients (mean age, 50 years ± 14 [standard deviation]; 388 men) were enrolled. Based on tumor location probabilistic maps, fusion location-radiomics models (averaged AUC values of grade/IDH/OS: 0.756/0.748/0.768) showed the highest accuracy in contrast to radiomics models (0.731/0.686/0.716) and location models (0.706/0.712/0.740). Notably, fusion models ([median Delta ACC: - 0.125, interquartile range: 0.130]) demonstrated improved generalization than that of radiomics model ([- 0.200, 0.195], p = 0.018). CLLA could empower ROI-based radiomics diagnosis of gliomas by improving the accuracy and generalization of the models. This study proposed a coordinatized lesion location analysis for glioma diagnosis, which could improve the performances of the conventional ROI-based radiomics model in accuracy and generalization. • Using coordinatized lesion location analysis, we mapped anatomic distribution patterns of gliomas with specific pathological and clinical features and constructed glioma prediction models. • We integrated coordinatized lesion location analysis into ROI-based analysis of radiomics to propose new fusion location-radiomics models. • Fusion location-radiomics models, with the advantages of being less influenced by variabilities, improved accuracy, and generalization performances of ROI-based radiomics models on predicting the diagnosis of gliomas.",2195

American journal of roentgenology,2023,"The first commercially available 7-T MRI scanner (Magnetom Terra) was approved by the FDA in 2017 for clinical imaging of the brain and knee. After initial protocol development and sequence optimization efforts in volunteers, the 7-T system, in combination with an FDA-approved 1-channel transmit/32-channel receive array head coil, can now be routinely used for clinical brain MRI examinations. The ultrahigh field strength of 7-T MRI has the advantages of improved spatial resolution, increased SNR, and increased CNR but also introduces an array of new technical challenges. The purpose of this article is to describe an institutional experience with the use of the commercially available 7-T MRI scanner for routine clinical brain imaging. Specific clinical indications for which 7-T MRI may be useful for brain imaging include brain tumor evaluation with possible perfusion imaging and/or spectroscopy, radiotherapy planning; evaluation of multiple sclerosis and other demyelinating diseases, evaluation of Parkinson disease and guidance of deep brain stimulator placement, high-detail intracranial MRA and vessel wall imaging, evaluation of pituitary pathology, and evaluation of epilepsy. Detailed protocols, including sequence parameters, for these various indications are presented, and implementation challenges (including artifacts, safety, and side effects) and potential solutions are explored.",1407

37368111,Ethnic diversity in treatment response for colorectal cancer: proof of concept for radiomics-driven enrichment trials.,European radiology,2023,"Several barriers hamper recruitment of diverse patient populations in multicenter clinical trials which determine efficacy of new systemic cancer therapies. We assessed if quantitative analysis of computed tomography (CT) scans of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients using imaging features that predict overall survival (OS) can unravel the association between ethnicity and efficacy. We retrospectively analyzed CT images from 1584 mCRC patients in two phase III trials evaluating FOLFOX ± panitumumab (n = 331, 350) and FOLFIRI ± aflibercept (n = 437, 466) collected from August 2006 to March 2013. Primary and secondary endpoints compared RECIST1.1 response at month-2 and delta tumor volume at month-2, respectively. An ancillary study compared imaging phenotype using a peer-reviewed radiomics-signature combining 3 imaging features to predict OS landmarked from month-2. Analysis was stratified by ethnicity. In total, 1584 patients were included (mean age, 60.25 ± 10.57 years; 969 men). Ethnicity was as follows: African (n = 50, 3.2%), Asian (n = 66, 4.2%), Caucasian (n = 1413, 89.2%), Latino (n = 27, 1.7%), Other (n = 28, 1.8%). Overall baseline tumor volume demonstrated Africans and Caucasians had more advanced disease (p < 0.001). Ethnicity was associated with treatment response. Response per RECIST1.1 at month-2 was distinct between ethnicities (p = 0.048) with higher response rate (55.6%) in Latinos. Overall delta tumor volume at month-2 demonstrated that Latino patients more likely experienced response to treatment (p = 0.021). Radiomics phenotype was also distinct in terms of tumor radiomics heterogeneity (p = 0.023). This study highlights how clinical trials that inadequately represent minority groups may impact associated translational work. In appropriately powered studies, radiomics features may allow us to unravel associations between ethnicity and treatment efficacy, better elucidate mechanisms of resistance, and promote diversity in trials through predictive enrichment. Radiomics could promote clinical trial diversity through predictive enrichment, hence benefit to historically underrepresented racial/ethnic groups that may respond variably to treatment due to socioeconomic factors and built environment, collectively referred to as social determinants of health. •Findings indicate ethnicity was associated with treatment response across all 3 endpoints. First, response per RECIST1.1 at month-2 was distinct between ethnicities (p = 0.048) with higher response rate (55.6%) in Latinos. •Second, the overall delta tumor volume at month-2 demonstrated that Latino patients were more likely to experience response to treatment (p = 0.021).

37368108,MRI proton density fat fraction for estimation of tumor grade in steatotic hepatocellular carcinoma.,European radiology,2023,"Image-based detection of intralesional fat in focal liver lesions has been established in diagnostic guidelines as a feature indicative of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and associated with a favorable prognosis. Given recent advances in MRI-based fat quantification techniques, we investigated a possible relationship between intralesional fat content and histologic tumor grade in steatotic HCCs. Patients with histopathologically confirmed HCC and prior MRI with proton density fat fraction (PDFF) mapping were retrospectively identified. Intralesional fat of HCCs was assessed using an ROI-based analysis and the median fat fraction of steatotic HCCs was compared between tumor grades G1-3 with non-parametric testing. ROC analysis was performed in case of statistically significant differences (p < 0.05). Subgroup analyses were conducted for patients with/without liver steatosis and with/without liver cirrhosis. A total of 57 patients with steatotic HCCs (62 lesions) were eligible for analysis. The median fat fraction was significantly higher for G1 lesions (median [interquartile range], 7.9% [6.0─10.7%]) than for G2 (4.4% [3.2─6.6%]; p = .001) and G3 lesions (4.7% [2.8─7.8%]; p = .036). PDFF was a good discriminator between G1 and G2/3 lesions (AUC .81; cut-off 5.8%, sensitivity 83%, specificity 68%) with comparable results in patients with liver cirrhosis. In patients with liver steatosis, intralesional fat content was higher than in the overall sample, with PDFF performing better in distinguishing between G1 and G2/3 lesions (AUC .92; cut-off 8.8%, sensitivity 83%, specificity 91%). Quantification of intralesional fat using MRI PDFF mapping allows distinction between well- and less-differentiated steatotic HCCs. PDFF mapping may help optimize precision medicine as a tool for tumor grade assessment in steatotic HCCs. Further investigation of intratumoral fat content as a potential prognostic indicator of treatment response is encouraged. • MRI proton density fat fraction mapping enables distinction between well- (G1) and less- (G2 and G3) differentiated steatotic hepatocellular carcinomas. • In a retrospective single-center study with 62 histologically proven steatotic hepatocellular carcinomas, G1 tumors showed a higher intralesional fat content than G2 and G3 tumors (7.9% vs. 4.4% and 4.7%; p = .004). • In liver steatosis, MRI proton density fat fraction mapping was an even better discriminator between G1 and G2/G3 steatotic hepatocellular carcinomas.",2493
37367448,Multimodality US versus Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System Criteria in Recommending Fine-Needle Aspiration of Thyroid Nodules.,Radiology,2023,"Background Current guidelines recommend the use of conventional US for risk stratification and management of thyroid nodules. However, fine-needle aspiration (FNA) is often recommended in benign nodules. Purpose To compare the diagnostic performance of multimodality US (including conventional US, strain elastography, and contrast-enhanced US [CEUS]) with the American College of Radiology Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System (TI-RADS) in the recommendation of FNA for thyroid nodules to reduce unnecessary biopsies. Materials and Methods In this prospective study, 445 consecutive participants with thyroid nodules from nine tertiary referral hospitals were recruited between October 2020 and May 2021. With univariable and multivariable logistic regression, the prediction models incorporating sonographic features, evaluated with interobserver agreement, were constructed and internally validated with bootstrap resampling technique. In addition, discrimination, calibration, and decision curve analysis were performed. Results A total of 434 thyroid nodules confirmed at pathologic analysis (259 malignant thyroid nodules) in 434 participants (mean age, 45 years ± 12 [SD]; 307 female participants) were included. Four multivariable models incorporated participant age, nodule features at US (proportion of cystic components, echogenicity, margin, shape, punctate echogenic foci), elastography features (stiffness), and CEUS features (blood volume). In recommending FNA in thyroid nodules, the highest area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was 0.85 (95% CI: 0.81, 0.89) for the multimodality US model, and the lowest AUC was 0.63 (95% CI: 0.59, 0.68) for TI-RADS (",1698
37367445,A Multicenter Assessment of Interreader Reliability of LI-RADS Version 2018 for MRI and CT.,Radiology,2023,"Background Various limitations have impacted research evaluating reader agreement for Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System (LI-RADS). Purpose To assess reader agreement of LI-RADS in an international multicenter multireader setting using scrollable images. Materials and Methods This retrospective study used deidentified clinical multiphase CT and MRI and reports with at least one untreated observation from six institutions and three countries; only qualifying examinations were submitted. Examination dates were October 2017 to August 2018 at the coordinating center. One untreated observation per examination was randomly selected using observation identifiers, and its clinically assigned features were extracted from the report. The corresponding LI-RADS version 2018 category was computed as a rescored clinical read. Each examination was randomly assigned to two of 43 research readers who independently scored the observation. Agreement for an ordinal modified four-category LI-RADS scale (LR-1, definitely benign; LR-2, probably benign; LR-3, intermediate probability of malignancy; LR-4, probably hepatocellular carcinoma [HCC]; LR-5, definitely HCC; LR-M, probably malignant but not HCC specific; and LR-TIV, tumor in vein) was computed using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs). Agreement was also computed for dichotomized malignancy (LR-4, LR-5, LR-M, and LR-TIV), LR-5, and LR-M. Agreement was compared between research-versus-research reads and research-versus-clinical reads. Results The study population consisted of 484 patients (mean age, 62 years ± 10 [SD]; 156 women; 93 CT examinations, 391 MRI examinations).

37367443,Effect of Human-AI Interaction on Detection of Malignant Lung Nodules on Chest Radiographs.,Radiology,2023,"Background The factors affecting radiologists' diagnostic determinations in artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted image reading remain underexplored. Purpose To assess how AI diagnostic performance and reader characteristics influence detection of malignant lung nodules during AI-assisted reading of chest radiographs. Materials and Methods This retrospective study consisted of two reading sessions from April 2021 to June 2021. Based on the first session without AI assistance, 30 readers were assigned into two groups with equivalent areas under the free-response receiver operating characteristic curve (AUFROCs). In the second session, each group reinterpreted radiographs assisted by either a high or low accuracy AI model (blinded to the fact that two different AI models were used). Reader performance for detecting lung cancer and reader susceptibility (changing the original reading following the AI suggestion) were compared. A generalized linear mixed model was used to identify the factors influencing AI-assisted detection performance, including readers' attitudes and experiences of AI and Grit score. Results Of the 120 chest radiographs assessed, 60 were obtained in patients with lung cancer (mean age, 67 years ± 12 [SD]; 32 male; 63 cancers) and 60 in controls (mean age, 67 years ± 12; 36 male). Readers included 20 thoracic radiologists (5-18 years of experience) and 10 radiology residents (2-3 years of experience). Use of the high accuracy AI model improved readers' detection performance to a greater extent than use of the low accuracy AI model (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.77 to 0.82 vs 0.75 to 0.75; AUFROC, 0.71 to 0.79 vs 0.7 to 0.72). Readers who used the high accuracy AI showed a higher susceptibility (67%, 224 of 334 cases) to changing their diagnosis based on the AI suggestions than those using the low accuracy AI (59%, 229 of 386 cases). Accurate readings at the first session, correct AI suggestions, high accuracy Al, and diagnostic difficulty were associated with accurate AI-assisted readings, but readers' characteristics were not. Conclusion An AI model with high diagnostic accuracy led to improved performance of radiologists in detecting lung cancer on chest radiographs and increased radiologists' susceptibility to AI suggestions. © RSNA, 2023 ",2326
37347430,Apparent diffusion coefficient correlates with different histopathological features in several intrahepatic tumors.,European radiology,2023,"To investigate associations between apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and cell count, Ki 67, tumor-stroma ratio (TSR), and tumoral lymphocytes in different hepatic malignancies. We identified 149 cases with performed liver biopsies: hepatocellular cancer (HCC, n = 53), intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (iCC, n = 29), metastases of colorectal cancer (CRC, n = 24), metastases of breast cancer (BC, n = 28), and metastases of pancreatic cancer (PC, n = 15). MRI was performed on a 1.5-T scanner with an axial echo-planar sequence. MRI was done before biopsy. Biopsy images of target lesions were selected. The cylindrical region of interest was placed on the ADC map of target lesions in accordance with the needle position on the biopsy images. Mean ADC values were estimated. TSR, cell counts, proliferation index Ki 67, and number of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes were estimated. Spearman's rank correlation coefficients and intraclass correlation coefficients were calculated. Inter-reader agreement was excellent regarding the ADC measurements. In HCC, ADC correlated with cell count (r =  - 0.68, p < 0.001) and with TSR (r = 0.31, p = 0.024). In iCC, ADC correlated with TSR (r = 0.60, p < 0.001) and with cell count (r =  - 0.54, p = 0.002). In CRC metastases, ADC correlated with cell count (r =  - 0.54 p = 0.006) and with Ki 67 (r =  - 0.46, p = 0.024). In BC liver metastases, ADC correlated with TSR (r = 0.55, p < 0.002) and with Ki 67 (r =  - 0.51, p = 0.006). In PC metastases, no significant correlations were found. ADC correlated with tumor cellularity in HCC, iCC, and CRC liver metastases. ADC reflects TSR in BC liver metastases, HCC, and iCC. ADC cannot reflect intratumoral lymphocytes. The present study shows that the apparent diffusion coefficient can be used as a surrogate imaging marker for different histopathological features in several malignant hepatic lesions. • ADC reflects different histopathological features in several hepatic tumors. • ADC correlates with tumor cellularity in HCC, iCC, and CRC metastases. • ADC strongly correlates with tumor-stroma ratio in BC metastases and iCC.",2125

This study included 230 patients with 242 surgically resected HCCs who underwent preoperative CT, of which 73/230 (31.7%) were scanned in external centres. The study cohort was split into training set (158 patients, 165 HCCs) and held-out test set (72 patients, 77 HCCs), stratified by random partitioning, which was repeated 100 times, and by a temporal partitioning to simulate the sequential development and clinical use of the radiomics model. A machine learning model for the prediction of MVI was developed with least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO). The concordance index (C-index) was used to assess the value to predict the recurrence-free (RFS) and overall survivals (OS). In the 100-repetition random partitioning cohorts, the radiomics model demonstrated a mean AUC of 0.54 (range 0.44-0.68) for the prediction of MVI, mean C-index of 0.59 (range 0.44-0.73) for RFS, and 0.65 (range 0.46-0.86) for OS in the held-out test set. In the temporal partitioning cohort, the radiomics model yielded an AUC of 0.50 for the prediction of MVI, a C-index of 0.61 for RFS, and 0.61 for OS, in the held-out test set. The radiomics models had a poor performance for the prediction of MVI with a large variability in the model performance depending on the random partitioning. Radiomics models demonstrated good performance in the prediction of patient outcomes. Patient selection within the training set strongly influenced the performance of the radiomics models for predicting microvascular invasion; therefore, a random approach to partitioning a retrospective cohort into a training set and a held-out set seems inappropriate. • The performance of the radiomics models for the prediction of microvascular invasion and survival widely ranged (AUC range 0.44-0.68) in the randomly partitioned cohorts. • The radiomics model for the prediction of microvascular invasion was unsatisfying when trying to simulate its sequential development and clinical use in a temporal partitioned cohort imaged with a variety of CT scanners. • The performance of the radiomics models for the prediction of survival was good with similar performances in the 100-repetition random partitioning and temporal partitioning cohorts.",2474
37338557,Markedly hypoechoic: a new definition improves the diagnostic performance of thyroid ultrasound.,European radiology,2023,"To determine the contribution of a modified definition of markedly hypoechoic in the differential diagnosis of thyroid nodules. A total of 1031 thyroid nodules were included in this retrospective multicenter study. All of the nodules were examined with US before surgery. The US features of the nodules were evaluated, in particular, the classical markedly hypoechoic and modified markedly hypoechoic (decreased or similar echogenicity relative to the adjacent strap muscles). The sensitivity, specificity, and AUC of classical/modified markedly hypoechoic and the corresponding ACR-TIRADS, EU-TIRADS, and C-TIRADS categories were calculated and compared. The inter- and intraobserver variability in the evaluation of the main US features of the nodules was assessed. There were 264 malignant nodules and 767 benign nodules. Compared with classical markedly hypoechoic as a diagnostic criterion for malignancy, using modified markedly hypoechoic as the criterion resulted in a significant increase in sensitivity (28.03% vs. 63.26%) and AUC (0.598 vs. 0.741), despite a significant decrease in specificity (91.53% vs. 84.88%) (p < 0.001 for all). Compared to the AUC of the C-TIRADS with the classical markedly hypoechoic, the AUC of the C-TIRADS with the modified markedly hypoechoic increased from 0.878 to 0.888 (p = 0.01); however, the AUCs of the ACR-TIRADS and EU-TIRADS did not change significantly (p > 0.05 for both). There was substantial interobserver agreement (κ = 0.624) and perfect intraobserver agreement (κ = 0.828) for the modified markedly hypoechoic. The modified definition of markedly hypoechoic resulted in a significantly improved diagnostic efficacy in determining malignant thyroid nodules and may improve the diagnostic performance of the C-TIRADS.

Patients with a single HCC ≤ 5 cm and accepting CEUS and EOB-MRI before surgery were enrolled in this study. Totally, 85 patients were randomly divided into the training and validation cohorts in a ratio of 7:3. Non-radiomics imaging features, the CEUS and EOB-MRI radiomics scores were extracted from the arterial phase, portal phase and delayed phase images of CEUS and the hepatobiliary phase images of EOB-MRI. Different MVI predicting models based on CEUS and EOB-MRI were constructed and their predictive values were evaluated. Since univariate analysis revealed that arterial peritumoral enhancement on the CEUS image, CEUS radiomics score, and EOB-MRI radiomics score were significantly associated with MVI, three prediction models, namely the CEUS model, the EOB-MRI model, and the CEUS-EOB model, were developed. In the validation cohort, the areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the CEUS model, the EOB-MRI model, and the CEUS-EOB model were 0.73, 0.79, and 0.86, respectively. Radiomics scores based on CEUS and EOB-MRI, combined with arterial peritumoral enhancement on CEUS, show a satisfying performance of MVI predicting. There was no significant difference in the efficacy of MVI risk evaluation between radiomics models based on CEUS and EOB-MRI in patients with a single HCC ≤ 5 cm. Radiomics models based on CEUS and EOB-MRI are effective for MVI predicting and conducive to pretreatment decision-making in patients with a single HCC within 5 cm. • Radiomics scores based on CEUS and EOB-MRI, combined with arterial peritumoral enhancement on CEUS, show a satisfying performance of MVI predicting. • There was no significant difference in the efficacy of MVI risk evaluation between radiomics models based on CEUS and EOB-MRI in patients with a single HCC ≤ 5 cm.",2080

We analyzed the trends in the incidence of detected pulmonary nodules and stage I lung cancer in chest CT scans in the period between 2008 and 2019. Imaging metadata and radiology reports from all chest CT studies were collected from two large Dutch hospitals. A natural language processing algorithm was developed to identify studies with any reported pulmonary nodule. Between 2008 and 2019, a total of 74,803 patients underwent 166,688 chest CT examinations at both hospitals combined. During this period, the annual number of chest CT scans increased from 9955 scans in 6845 patients in 2008 to 20,476 scans in 13,286 patients in 2019. The proportion of patients in whom nodules (old or new) were reported increased from 38% (2595/6845) in 2008 to 50% (6654/13,286) in 2019. The proportion of patients in whom significant new nodules (≥ 5 mm) were reported increased from 9% (608/6954) in 2010 to 17% (1660/9883) in 2017. The number of patients with new nodules and corresponding stage I lung cancer diagnosis tripled and their proportion doubled, from 0.4% (26/6954) in 2010 to 0.8% (78/9883) in 2017. The identification of incidental pulmonary nodules in chest CT has steadily increased over the past decade and has been accompanied by more stage I lung cancer diagnoses. These findings stress the importance of identifying and efficiently managing incidental pulmonary nodules in routine clinical practice. • The number of patients who underwent chest CT examinations substantially increased over the past decade, as did the number of patients in whom pulmonary nodules were identified. • The increased use of chest CT and more frequently identified pulmonary nodules were associated with more stage I lung cancer diagnoses.",1831

We investigated this hypothesis in a prospective clinical trial and correlated residual disease volumes with clinical outcome in newly diagnosed glioblastoma. This is a prospective controlled multicenter parallel-group trial with two center-specific treatment arms (5-ALA and iMRI) and blinded evaluation. The primary end point was complete resection of contrast enhancement on early postoperative MRI. We assessed resectability and extent of resection by an independent blinded centralized review of preoperative and postoperative MRI with 1-mm slices. Secondary end points included progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS), patient-reported quality of life, and clinical parameters. We recruited 314 patients with newly diagnosed glioblastomas at 11 German centers. A total of 127 patients in the 5-ALA and 150 in the iMRI arm were analyzed in the as-treated analysis.

37328641,Diffusion MRI of the facial-vestibulocochlear nerve complex: a prospective clinical validation study.,European radiology,2023,"Surgical planning of vestibular schwannoma surgery would benefit greatly from a robust method of delineating the facial-vestibulocochlear nerve complex with respect to the tumour. This study aimed to optimise a multi-shell readout-segmented diffusion-weighted imaging (rs-DWI) protocol and develop a novel post-processing pipeline to delineate the facial-vestibulocochlear complex within the skull base region, evaluating its accuracy intraoperatively using neuronavigation and tracked electrophysiological recordings. In a prospective study of five healthy volunteers and five patients who underwent vestibular schwannoma surgery, rs-DWI was performed and colour tissue maps (CTM) and probabilistic tractography of the cranial nerves were generated. In patients, the average symmetric surface distance (ASSD) and 95% Hausdorff distance (HD-95) were calculated with reference to the neuroradiologist-approved facial nerve segmentation. The accuracy of patient results was assessed intraoperatively using neuronavigation and tracked electrophysiological recordings. Using CTM alone, the facial-vestibulocochlear complex of healthy volunteer subjects was visualised on 9/10 sides. CTM were generated in all 5 patients with vestibular schwannoma enabling the facial nerve to be accurately identified preoperatively. The mean ASSD between the annotators' two segmentations was 1.11 mm (SD 0.40) and the mean HD-95 was 4.62 mm (SD 1.78). The median distance from the nerve segmentation to a positive stimulation point was 1.21 mm (IQR 0.81-3.27 mm) and 2.03 mm (IQR 0.99-3.84 mm) for the two annotators, respectively. rs-DWI may be used to acquire dMRI data of the cranial nerves within the posterior fossa. Readout-segmented diffusion-weighted imaging and colour tissue mapping provide 1-2 mm spatially accurate imaging of the facial-vestibulocochlear nerve complex, enabling accurate preoperative localisation of the facial nerve.

Our group produced plasmonics-active gold nanostars (GNS) designed to preferentially accumulate within intracranial tumors and amplify the ablative capacity of LITT. The impact of GNS on LITT coverage capacity was tested in ex vivo models using clinical LITT equipment and agarose gel-based phantoms of control and GNS-infused central ""tumors."" In vivo accumulation of GNS and amplification of ablation were tested in murine intracranial and extracranial tumor models followed by intravenous GNS injection, PET/CT, two-photon photoluminescence, inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), histopathology, and laser ablation. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrated the potential of GNS to accelerate and specify thermal distributions. In ex vivo cuboid tumor phantoms, the GNS-infused phantom heated 5.5× faster than the control. In a split-cylinder tumor phantom, the GNS-infused border heated 2× faster and the surrounding area was exposed to 30% lower temperatures, with margin conformation observed in a model of irregular GNS distribution. In vivo, GNS preferentially accumulated within intracranial tumors on PET/CT, two-photon photoluminescence, and ICP-MS at 24 and 72 hours and significantly expedited and increased the maximal temperature achieved in laser ablation compared with control. Our results provide evidence for use of GNS to improve the efficiency and potentially safety of LITT. The in vivo data support selective accumulation within intracranial tumors and amplification of laser ablation, and the GNS-infused phantom experiments demonstrate increased rates of heating, heat contouring to tumor borders, and decreased heating of surrounding regions representing normal structures.",1830
37318605,Exploring the added value of pretherapeutic MR descriptors in predicting breast cancer pathologic complete response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy.,European radiology,2023,"To evaluate the association between pretreatment MRI descriptors and breast cancer (BC) pathological complete response (pCR) to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). Patients with BC treated by NAC with a breast MRI between 2016 and 2020 were included in this retrospective observational single-center study. MR studies were described using the standardized BI-RADS and breast edema score on T2-weighted MRI. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to assess variables association with pCR according to residual cancer burden. Random forest classifiers were trained to predict pCR on a random split including 70% of the database and were validated on the remaining cases. Among 129 BC, 59 (46%) achieved pCR after NAC (luminal (n = 7/37, 19%), triple negative (n = 30/55, 55%), HER2 + (n = 22/37, 59%)). Clinical and biological items associated with pCR were BC subtype (p < 0.001), T stage 0/I/II (p = 0.008), higher Ki67 (p = 0.005), and higher tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes levels (p = 0.016). Univariate analysis showed that the following MRI features, oval or round shape (p = 0.047), unifocality (p = 0.026), non-spiculated margins (p = 0.018), no associated non-mass enhancement (p = 0.024), and a lower MRI size (p = 0.031), were significantly associated with pCR. Unifocality and non-spiculated margins remained independently associated with pCR at multivariable analysis. Adding significant MRI features to clinicobiological variables in random forest classifiers significantly increased sensitivity (0.67 versus 0.62), specificity (0.69 versus 0.67), and precision (0.71 versus 0.67) for pCR prediction. Non-spiculated margins and unifocality are independently associated with pCR and can increase models performance to predict BC response to NAC. A multimodal approach integrating pretreatment MRI features with clinicobiological predictors, including tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, could be employed to develop machine learning models for identifying patients at risk of non-response. This may enable consideration of alternative therapeutic strategies to optimize treatment outcomes. • Unifocality and non-spiculated margins are independently associated with pCR at multivariable logistic regression analysis. • Breast edema score is associated with MR tumor size and TIL expression, not only in TN BC as previously reported, but also in luminal BC. • Adding significant MRI features to clinicobiological variables in machine learning classifiers significantly increased sensitivity, specificity, and precision for pCR prediction.",2574

Institutional database retrospective research identified 76 patients with a biopsy-proven solitary T1a (84%) or T1b (16%) RCC; all patients underwent CT-guided MWA ablation. Tumor complexity was reviewed by calculating RENAL and mRENAL scores. The majority of the lesions were exophytic (82.9%), with > 7 mm nearness to the collecting system (53.9%), located posteriorly (73.6%), and lower to polar lines (61.8%). Mean RENAL and mRENAL scores were 5.7 (SD = 1.9) and 6.1 (SD = 2.1) respectively. Progression rates were significantly higher with greater tumor size (> 4 cm), with < 4 mm nearness to the collecting system, for tumors crossing a polar line and with the anterior location. None of the above was associated with complications. RENAL and mRENAL scores were significantly higher in patients with incomplete ablation. The ROC analysis showed the significant prognostic ability of both RENAL and mRENAL scores for progression. In both scores, the optimal cut-off point was 6.5. Univariate Cox regression analysis for progression showed a hazard ratio of 7.73 for the RENAL score and 7.48 for the mRENAL score. The results of the present study show that the risk of progression was higher in patients with RENAL and mRENAL score of > 6.5, in T1b tumors, close to the collective system (< 4 mm), crossing polar lines and anterior location. CT-guided percutaneous MWA is a safe and effective technique for the treatment of T1a renal cell carcinomas. Different morphometric parameters of RCC tumors including RENAL and mRENAL score > 6.5, size, proximity to the collecting system, and crossing of polar lines impact the efficacy of MWA and progression survival rates. • The risk of progression is higher in patients with RENAL and mRENAL score > 6.5, in T1b tumors, close to the collective system (< 4 mm), crossing polar lines and anterior location. • The significant prognostic ability of the mRENAL score for progression was higher than the respective of the RENAL score. • Complications were not associated with any of the above factors.",2267
37314475,The feasibility of contrast-enhanced CT to identify the adhesive renal venous tumor thrombus of renal cell carcinoma.,European radiology,2023,"To identify adhesive renal venous tumor thrombus (RVTT) of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) by contrast-enhancement CT (CECT). Our retrospective study included 53 patients who underwent preoperative CECT and pathologically confirmed RCC combined with RVTT. They were divided into two groups based on the intra-operative findings of RVTT adhesion to the venous wall, with 26 cases in the adhesive RVTT group (ARVTT) and 27 cases in the non-adhesive group (NRVTT). The location, maximum diameter (MD) and CT values of tumors, the maximum length (ML) and width (MW) of RVTT, and length of inferior vena cava tumor thrombus were compared between the two groups. The presence of renal venous wall involvement, renal venous wall inflammation, and enlarged retroperitoneal lymph node was compared between the two groups. A receiver operating characteristic curve was used to analyze the diagnostic performance. The MD of RCC and the ML and MW of the RVTT were all larger in the ARVTT group than in the NRVTT group (p = 0.042, p < 0.001, and p = 0.002). The proportion of renal vein wall involvement and renal vein wall inflammation were higher in the ARVTT group than in NRVTT groups (both p < 0.001). The multivariable model including ML and vascular wall inflammation to predict ARVTT could achieve the best diagnostic performance with the area under the curve, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 0.91, 88.5%, 96.3%, and 92.5%, respectively. The multivariable model acquired by CECT images could be used to predict RVTT adhesion. For RCC patients with tumor thrombus, contrast-enhanced CT could noninvasively predict the adhesion of tumor thrombus, thus predicting the difficulty of surgery and contributing to the selection of an appropriate treatment plan. • The length and width of the tumor thrombus could be used to predict its adhesion to the vessel wall. • Adhesion of the tumor thrombus can be reflected by inflammation of the renal vein wall. • The multivariable model from CECT can well predict whether the tumor thrombus adhered to the vein wall.",2053

In total, 78 patients with ESCC who underwent radical esophagectomy and DECT from June 2019 to August 2020 were enrolled in this study. Normalized iodine concentration (NIC) and electron density (Rho) in tumors were measured using arterial and venous phase images, whereas unenhanced images were used to determine the effective atomic number (Z NIC in the arterial phase (A-NIC; hazards ratio [HR], 3.91; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.79-8.56; p = 0.001) and pathological grade (PG; HR, 2.69; 95% CI, 1.32-5.49; p = 0.007) were identified as significant risk predictors of ER. The area under the curve of A-NIC for predicting ER in patients with ESCC was not significantly higher than that of PG (0.72 vs. 0.66, p = 0.441). In a stratified survival analysis, patients with high A-NIC or poorly differentiated ESCC had a higher rate of ER than those with low A-NIC or highly/moderately differentiated ESCC. A-NIC derived from DECT can be used to noninvasively predict preoperative ER in patients with ESCC, with an efficacy comparable to that of pathological grade. Preoperative quantitative measurement of dual-energy CT parameters can predict the early recurrence of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and serve as an independent prognostic factor to guide clinical designation of personalized treatment. • Normalized iodine concentration in the arterial phase and pathological grade were independent risk predictors of early recurrence in patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. • Normalized iodine concentration in the arterial phase may be a noninvasive imaging marker for preoperatively predicting early recurrence in patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. • The efficacy of normalized iodine concentration in the arterial phase derived from dual-energy computed tomography for predicting early recurrence is comparable to that of pathological grade.",2114

37310248,Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-Cell Therapy and Imaging Applications for Large B-Cell Lymphoma.,Radiology,2023,"Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy has revolutionized the treatment of large B-cell lymphoma (LBCL) and other hematologic malignancies. Its mechanism of action relies on recent biotechnological advances that allow clinicians to harness and enhance a patient's immune system to fight cancerous cells. The indications for CAR T-cell therapy continue to expand, with ongoing trials evaluating their use in other hematologic and solid organ malignancies. This review explores the vital role of diagnostic imaging in patient selection and treatment response in CAR T-cell therapy for LBCL and the management of specific therapy-related adverse events. For a patient-centered and cost-effective use of CAR T-cell therapy, it is crucial to select patients who are likely to derive long-term benefit and optimize their care during a lengthy treatment pathway. Metabolic tumor volume and kinetics assessed at PET/CT have emerged as powerful tools to predict outcome after CAR T-cell therapy in LBCL, allowing for the early identification of lesions refractory to treatment and identification of the severity of CAR T-cell therapy toxicity. Radiologists should be aware that the success of CAR T-cell therapy is mitigated by adverse events, most importantly neurotoxicity, which remains poorly understood and challenging to treat. Neuroimaging, with experienced clinical evaluation, is critical in the diagnosis and management of neurotoxicity and the exclusion of other central nervous system complications that can occur in this clinically vulnerable patient group. This review discusses current applications of imaging in the standard CAR T-cell therapy pathway for the treatment of LBCL, which serves as a model disease in the integration of diagnostic imaging and radiomic risk markers.",1793

This is a retrospective study based on multi-center cohorts. A total of 473 participants with pathologically proved renal cell carcinoma were split into the internal training and the external testing set. The training set contains 412 cases from five open-source cohorts and two local hospitals. The external testing set includes 61 participants from another local hospital. The proposed automatic analytic framework contains the following modules: a 3D kidney and tumor segmentation model constructed by 3D-UNet, a multi-level feature extractor based on the region of interest, and a partial or radical nephrectomy prediction classifier by XGBoost. The fivefold cross-validation strategy was used to get a robust model. A quantitative model interpretation method called the Shapley Additive Explanations was conducted to explore the contribution of each feature. In the prediction of partial versus radical nephrectomy, the combination of multi-level features achieved better performance than any single-level feature. For the internal validation, the AUROC was 0.93 ± 0.1, 0.94 ± 0.1, 0.93 ± 0.1, 0.93 ± 0.1, and 0.93 ± 0.1, respectively, as determined by the fivefold cross-validation. The AUROC from the optimal model was 0.82 ± 0.1 in the external testing set. The tumor shape Maximum 3D Diameter plays the most vital role in the model decision. The automated surgical decision framework for partial or radical nephrectomy based on 3D-CT multi-level anatomical features exhibits robust performance in renal cell carcinoma. The framework points the way towards guiding surgery through medical images and machine learning. We proposed an automated analytic framework that can assist surgeons in partial or radical nephrectomy decision-making. The framework points the way towards guiding surgery through medical images and machine learning. • The 3D-CT multi-level anatomical features provide a more accurate prediction of surgical decision-making for partial or radical nephrectomy in renal cell carcinoma. • The data from multicenter study and a strict fivefold cross-validation strategy, both internal validation set and external testing set, can be easily transferred to different tasks of new datasets. • The quantitative decomposition of the prediction model was conducted to explore the contribution of each extracted feature.",2522

We aimed to identify TNBC among invasive cancers presenting as masses using maximum slope (MS) and time to enhancement (TTE) measured on ultrafast (UF) DCE-MRI, ADC measured on DWI, and rim enhancement on UF DCE-MRI and early-phase DCE-MRI. This retrospective single-center study, between December 2015 and May 2020, included patients with breast cancer presenting as masses. Early-phase DCE-MRI was performed immediately after UF DCE-MRI. Interrater agreements were evaluated using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and Cohen's kappa. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses of the MRI parameters, lesion size, and patient age were performed to predict TNBC and create a prediction model. The programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression statuses of the patients with TNBCs were also evaluated. In total, 187 women (mean age, 58 years ± 12.9 [standard deviation]) with 191 lesions (33 TNBCs) were evaluated. The ICC for MS, TTE, ADC, and lesion size were 0.95, 0.97, 0.83, and 0.99, respectively. The kappa values of rim enhancements on UF and early-phase DCE-MRI were 0.88 and 0.84, respectively. MS on UF DCE-MRI and rim enhancement on early-phase DCE-MRI remained significant parameters after multivariate analyses. The prediction model created using these significant parameters yielded an area under the curve of 0.74 (95% CI, 0.65, 0.84). The PD-L1-expressing TNBCs tended to have higher rim enhancement rates than the non-PD-L1-expressing TNBCs. A multiparametric model using UF and early-phase DCE-MRI parameters may be a potential imaging biomarker to identify TNBCs. Prediction of TNBC or non-TNBC at an early point of diagnosis is crucial for appropriate management. This study offers the potential of UF and early-phase DCE-MRI to offer a solution to this clinical issue. • It is crucial to predict TNBC at an early clinical period. • Parameters on UF DCE-MRI and early-phase conventional DCE-MRI help in predicting TNBC. • Prediction of TNBC by MRI may be useful in determining appropriate clinical management.",2138

Surgically confirmed GGVMs and GGSs between 2016 and 2021 were retrospectively included. Preoperative HRCT, routine MR, and dynamic T1WI were performed on all patients. Clinical data, imaging characteristics including lesion size, involvement of facial nerve (FN), signal intensity, enhancement pattern on dynamic T1WI, and bone destruction on HRCT were evaluated. Logistic regression model was developed to identify independent factors for GGVMs, and the diagnostic performance was accessed by receiving operative curve (ROC) analysis. Histological characteristics were explored for both GGVMs and GGSs. Twenty GGVMs and 23 GGSs with mean age of 31 were included. On dynamic T1WI, 18 GGVMs (18/20) showed ""pattern A"" enhancement (a progressive filling enhancement), while all 23 GGSs showed ""pattern B"" enhancement (a gradual whole-lesion enhancement) (p < 0.001). Thirteen GGVMs (13/20) showed the ""honeycomb"" sign whereas all GGS (23/23) showed extensive bone changes on HRCT (p < 0.001). Lesion size, involvement of FN segment, signal intensity on non-contrast T1WI and T2-weighted imaging (T2WI), and homogeneity on enhanced T1WI were obviously differed between two lesions (p < 0.001, p = 0.002, p < 0.001, p = 0.01, p = 0.02, respectively). Regression model showed the ""honeycomb"" sign and ""pattern A"" enhancement were independent risk factors. Histologically, GGVM was characterized by interwoven dilated and tortuous veins, while GGS was characterized by abundant spindle cells with dense arterioles or capillaries. The ""honeycomb"" sign on HRCT and ""pattern A"" enhancement on dynamic T1WI are the most promising imaging characteristics for differentiating GGVM from GGS. The characteristic sign and enhancement pattern on HRCT and dynamic T1-weighted imaging allow preoperative differentiation of geniculate ganglion venous malformation and schwannoma feasible, which will improve clinical management and benefit patient prognosis. • The ""honeycomb"" sign on HRCT is a reliable finding to differentiate GGVM from GGS. • GGVM typically shows ""pattern A"" enhancement (focal enhancement of the tumor on early dynamic T1WI, followed by progressive contrast filling of the tumor in the delayed phase), while ""pattern B"" enhancement (gradual heterogeneous or homogeneous enhancement of the whole lesion) is observed in GGS on dynamic T1WI.",2530
37278853,Ultrafast DCE-MRI for discriminating pregnancy-associated breast cancer lesions from lactation related background parenchymal enhancement.,European radiology,2023,"To investigate the utility of ultrafast dynamic-contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI in visualization and quantitative characterization of pregnancy-associated breast cancer (PABC) and its differentiation from background-parenchymal-enhancement (BPE) among lactating patients. Twenty-nine lactating participants, including 10 PABC patients and 19 healthy controls, were scanned on 3-T MRI using a conventional DCE protocol interleaved with a golden-angle radial sparse parallel (GRASP) ultrafast sequence for the initial phase. The timing of the visualization of PABC lesions was compared to lactational BPE. Contrast-noise ratio (CNR) was compared between the ultrafast and conventional DCE sequences. The differences in each group's ultrafast-derived kinetic parameters including maximal slope (MS), time to enhancement (TTE), and area under the curve (AUC) were statistically examined using the Mann-Whitney test and receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. On ultrafast MRI, breast cancer lesions enhanced earlier than BPE (p < 0.0001), enabling breast cancer visualization freed from lactation BPE. A higher CNR was found for ultrafast acquisitions vs. conventional DCE (p < 0.05). Significant differences in AUC, MS, and TTE values were found between the tumor and BPE (p < 0.05), with ROC-derived AUC of 0.86 ± 0.06, 0.82 ± 0.07, and 0.68 ± 0.08, respectively. The BPE grades of the lactating PABC patients were reduced as compared with the healthy lactating controls (p < 0.005). Ultrafast DCE MRI allows BPE-free visualization of lesions, improved tumor conspicuity, and kinetic quantification of breast cancer during lactation. Implementation of this method may assist in the utilization of breast MRI for lactating patients. The ultrafast sequence appears to be superior to conventional DCE MRI in the challenging evaluation of the lactating breast. Thus, supporting its possible utilization in the setting of high-risk screening during lactation and the diagnostic workup of PABC. • Differences in the enhancement slope of cancer relative to BPE allowed the optimal visualization of PABC lesions on mid-acquisitions of ultrafast DCE, in which the tumor enhanced prior to the background parenchyma. • The conspicuity of PABC lesions on top of the lactation-related BPE was increased using an ultrafast sequence as compared with conventional DCE MRI. • Ultrafast-derived maps provided further characterization and parametric contrast between PABC lesions and lactation-related BPE.",2496
37278629,An MRI Deep Learning Model Predicts Outcome in Rectal Cancer.,Radiology,2023,"Background Deep learning (DL) models can potentially improve prognostication of rectal cancer but have not been systematically assessed. Purpose To develop and validate an MRI DL model for predicting survival in patients with rectal cancer based on segmented tumor volumes from pretreatment T2-weighted MRI scans. Materials and Methods DL models were trained and validated on retrospectively collected MRI scans of patients with rectal cancer diagnosed between August 2003 and April 2021 at two centers. Patients were excluded from the study if there were concurrent malignant neoplasms, prior anticancer treatment, incomplete course of neoadjuvant therapy, or no radical surgery performed. The Harrell C-index was used to determine the best model, which was applied to internal and external test sets. Patients were stratified into high- and low-risk groups based on a fixed cutoff calculated in the training set. A multimodal model was also assessed, which used DL model-computed risk score and pretreatment carcinoembryonic antigen level as input. Results The training set included 507 patients (median age, 56 years [IQR, 46-64 years]; 355 men). In the validation set (",1173

Purpose To compare selected existing mammography artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms and the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium (BCSC) risk model for prediction of 5-year risk. Materials and Methods This retrospective case-cohort study included data in women with a negative screening mammographic examination (no visible evidence of cancer) in 2016, who were followed until 2021 at Kaiser Permanente Northern California. Women with prior breast cancer or a highly penetrant gene mutation were excluded. Of the 324 009 eligible women, a random subcohort was selected, regardless of cancer status, to which all additional patients with breast cancer were added. The index screening mammographic examination was used as input for five AI algorithms to generate continuous scores that were compared with the BCSC clinical risk score. Risk estimates for incident breast cancer 0 to 5 years after the initial mammographic examination were calculated using a time-dependent area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Results The subcohort included 13 628 patients, of whom 193 had incident cancer. Incident cancers in eligible patients (additional 4391 of 324 009) were also included. For incident cancers at 0 to 5 years, the time-dependent AUC for BCSC was 0.61 (95% CI: 0.60, 0.62). AI algorithms had higher time-dependent AUCs than did BCSC, ranging from 0.63 to 0.67 (Bonferroni-adjusted ",1560
37266658,Prediction of Ki-67 expression in gastrointestinal stromal tumors using radiomics of plain and multiphase contrast-enhanced CT.,European radiology,2023,"To study the value of radiomics models based on plain and multiphase contrast-enhanced CT to predict Ki-67 expression in gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs). A total of 215 patients with GISTs were retrospectively analyzed, including 150 patients in one hospital as the training set and 65 patients in another hospital as the external verification set. The tumor at the largest level of CT images was delineated as the region of interest (ROI). The maximum diameter of the ROI was defined as the tumor size. A total of 851 radiomics features were extracted from each ROI by 3D Slicer Radiomics. After dimensionality reduction, three machine learning classification algorithms including logistic regression (LR), random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM) were used for Ki-67 expression prediction. Using a multivariable logistic model, a nomogram was established to predict the expression of Ki-67 individually. Delong tests showed that the SVM models had the highest accuracy in the arterial phase (Z value 0.217-1.139) and venous phase (Z value 0.022-1.396). For the plain phase, LR and SVM models had the highest accuracy (Z value 0.874-1.824, 1.139-1.763). For the delayed phase, LR models had the highest accuracy (Z value 0.056-1.824). For the combined phase, RF models had the highest accuracy (Z value 0.232-1.978). There was no significant difference among the above models for KI-67 expression prediction (Z value 0.022-1.978). A nomogram was developed with a C-index of 0.913 (95% CI, 0.878 to 0.956). Radiomics of both plain and enhanced CT images could accurately predict the expression of Ki-67 in GIST. For patients who were not suitable to use contrast agents, plain scan could be used as an alternative. CT radiomics could accurately predict the expression of Ki-67 in GIST, which has a great clinical value in reflecting the proliferative activity of tumor cells and helping determine whether a patient is suitable for adjuvant therapy with imatinib. • Radiomics of both plain and enhanced CT images could accurately predict the expression of Ki-67 in GIST. • For patients who were not suitable to use contrast agents, plain scan could be used as an alternative. • A radiomics nomogram was developed to allow personalized preoperative evaluation with high accuracy.",2297
37266657,"Can incorrect artificial intelligence (AI) results impact radiologists, and if so, what can we do about it? A multi-reader pilot study of lung cancer detection with chest radiography.",European radiology,2023,"To examine whether incorrect AI results impact radiologist performance, and if so, whether human factors can be optimized to reduce error. Multi-reader design, 6 radiologists interpreted 90 identical chest radiographs (follow-up CT needed: yes/no) on four occasions (09/20-01/22). No AI result was provided for session 1. Sham AI results were provided for sessions 2-4, and AI for 12 cases were manipulated to be incorrect (8 false positives (FP), 4 false negatives (FN)) (0.87 ROC-AUC). In the Delete AI (No Box) condition, radiologists were told AI results would not be saved for the evaluation. In Keep AI (No Box) and Keep AI (Box), radiologists were told results would be saved. In Keep AI (Box), the ostensible AI program visually outlined the region of suspicion. AI results were constant between conditions. Relative to the No AI condition (FN = 2.7%, FP = 51.4%), FN and FPs were higher in the Keep AI (No Box) (FN = 33.0%, FP = 86.0%), Delete AI (No Box) (FN = 26.7%, FP = 80.5%), and Keep AI (Box) (FN = to 20.7%, FP = 80.5%) conditions (all ps < 0.05). FNs were higher in the Keep AI (No Box) condition (33.0%) than in the Keep AI (Box) condition (20.7%) (p = 0.04). FPs were higher in the Keep AI (No Box) (86.0%) condition than in the Delete AI (No Box) condition (80.5%) (p = 0.03). Incorrect AI causes radiologists to make incorrect follow-up decisions when they were correct without AI. This effect is mitigated when radiologists believe AI will be deleted from the patient's file or a box is provided around the region of interest. When AI is wrong, radiologists make more errors than they would have without AI. Based on human factors psychology, our manuscript provides evidence for two AI implementation strategies that reduce the deleterious effects of incorrect AI. • When AI provided incorrect results, false negative and false positive rates among the radiologists increased. • False positives decreased when AI results were deleted, versus kept, in the patient's record. • False negatives and false positives decreased when AI visually outlined the region of suspicion.",2095
37266656,Automated CT quantification of interstitial lung abnormality and interstitial lung disease according to the Fleischner Society in patients with resectable lung cancer: prognostic significance.,European radiology,2023,"To assess the prognostic significance of automatically quantified interstitial lung abnormality (ILA) according to the definition by the Fleischner Society in patients with resectable non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Patients who underwent lobectomy or pneumonectomy for NSCLC between January 2015 and December 2019 were retrospectively included. Preoperative CT scans were analyzed using the commercially available deep-learning-based automated quantification software for ILA. According to quantified results and the definition by the Fleischner Society and multidisciplinary discussion, patients were divided into normal, ILA, and interstitial lung disease (ILD) groups. Of the 1524 patients, 87 (5.7%) and 20 (1.3%) patients had ILA and ILD, respectively. Both ILA (HR, 1.81; 95% CI: 1.25-2.61; p = .002) and ILD (HR, 5.26; 95% CI: 2.99-9.24; p < .001) groups had poor recurrence-free survival (RFS). Overall survival (OS) decreased (HR 2.13 [95% CI: 1.27-3.58; p = .004] for the ILA group and 7.20 [95% CI: 3.80-13.62, p < .001] for the ILD group) as the disease severity increased. Both quantified fibrotic and non-fibrotic ILA components were associated with poor RFS (HR, 1.57; 95% CI: 1.12-2.21; p = .009; and HR, 1.11; 95% CI: 1.01-1.23; p = .03) and OS (HR, 1.59; 95% CI: 1.06-2.37; p = .02; and HR, 1.17; 95% CI: 1.03-1.33; and p = .01) in normal and ILA groups. The automated CT quantification of ILA based on the definition by the Fleischner Society predicts outcomes of patients with resectable lung cancer based on the disease category and quantified fibrotic and non-fibrotic ILA components. Quantitative CT assessment of ILA provides prognostic information for lung cancer patients after surgery, which can help in considering active surveillance for recurrence, especially in those with a larger extent of quantified ILA. • Of the 1524 patients with resectable lung cancer, 1417 (93.0%) patients were categorized as normal, 87 (5.7%) as interstitial lung abnormality (ILA), and 20 (1.3%) as interstitial lung disease (ILD). • Both ILA and ILD groups were associated with poor recurrence-free survival (hazard ratio [HR], 1.81, p = .002; HR, 5.26, p < .001, respectively) and overall survival (HR, 2.13; p = .004; HR, 7.20; p < .001). • Both quantified fibrotic and non-fibrotic ILA components were associated with recurrence-free survival and overall survival in normal and ILA groups.",2407
37266655,Can we rely on contrast-enhanced CT to identify pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma? A population-based study in sensitivity and factors associated with false negatives.,European radiology,2023,"To determine the sensitivity of contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) in detecting pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and identify factors associated with false negatives (FNs). Patients diagnosed with PDAC in 2014-2015 were retrospectively identified by a cancer registry. CECTs performed during the diagnostic interval were retrospectively classified as true positive (TP), indeterminate, or FN. Sensitivity TP/(TP+FN) was calculated for all CECTs and the following subgroups: protocol (uniphasic vs. biphasic); tumor size (≤ 2 cm vs. > 2 cm); and resectability (potentially resectable vs. unresectable). Multivariate logistic regression was performed to assess which of the following factors were associated with FN: clinical suspicion of PDAC; size >2 cm; presence of metastases; protocol; isoattenuating tumor; and potentially resectable disease on imaging. In total, 176 CECTs (127 uniphasic; 49 biphasic) in 154 patients (90 men, mean age 72 ± 11 years) were included. Sensitivity was 125/149 (83.9%) overall and 87/106 (82.1%) and 38/43 (88.4%) for uniphasic and biphasic protocols, respectively. Sensitivity was decreased for tumors ≤ 2 cm (45.4% vs. 90.6%), no liver metastases (78.0% vs. 95.9%), and potentially resectable disease (65.3% vs. 93.0%). Factors significantly associated with FN were clinical suspicion (OR, 0.24, 95% CI: 0.07-0.75), size>2 cm (OR, 0.10, 95% CI: 0.02-0.44), absence of liver metastases (OR, 4.94, 95% CI: 1.29-22.99), and potentially resectable disease (OR, 4.13, 95% CI: 1.07-16.65). In our population, the overall sensitivity of CECT to detect PDAC is 83.9%; however, this is substantially lower in several scenarios, including patients with potentially resectable disease. This finding has important implications for patient outcomes and efforts to maximize CECT sensitivity should be sought. The sensitivity of CECT to detect PDAC is significantly decreased in the setting of sub-2 cm tumors and potentially resectable disease. A dedicated biphasic pancreatic CECT protocol has higher sensitivity and should be applied in patients with suspected pancreatic disease. • The sensitivities of contrast-enhanced CT for the detection of PDAC were 87/106 (82.1%) and 38/43 (88.4%) for uniphasic and biphasic protocols, respectively. • The sensitivity of contrast-enhanced CT was decreased for small tumors ≤ 2 cm (45.4% vs. 90.6%), if there were no liver metastases (78.0% vs. 95.9%), and with potentially resectable disease (65.3% vs. 93.0%). • Absence of liver metastases (OR, 4.94, 95% CI: 1.29-22.99) and potentially resectable disease (OR, 4.13, 95% CI: 1.07-16.65) were associated with a false--negative (FN) CT result; suspicion of malignancy on the imaging requisition (OR, 0.24, 95% CI: 0.07-0.75) and size > 2 cm (OR, 0.10, 95% CI: 0.02-0.44) were negatively associated with FN.",2837

This phase I dose-escalation multicenter study enrolled postmenopausal women with ER+/HER2- metastatic breast cancer to determine the safety, pharmacokinetics, and recommended phase II dose of GDC-0927. Pharmacodynamics was assessed with [18F]-fluoroestradiol (FES) PET scans. Forty-two patients received GDC-0927 once daily. The MTD was not reached. The most common adverse events (AE) regardless of causality were nausea, constipation, diarrhea, arthralgia, fatigue, hot flush, back pain, and vomiting. There were no deaths, grade 4/5 AEs, or treatment-related serious AEs. Two patients experienced grade 2 AEs of special interest of deep vein thrombosis and jugular vein thrombosis, both considered unrelated to GDC-0927. Following dosing, approximately 1.6-fold accumulation was observed, consistent with the observed half-life and dosing frequency. There were no complete or partial responses. Pharmacodynamics was supported by >90% reduction in FES uptake and an approximately 40% reduction in ER expression, suggesting ER degradation is not the mechanistic driver of ER antagonism. Twelve patients (29%) achieved clinical benefit; 17 patients (41%) showed a confirmed best overall response of stable disease. Baseline levels of ER and progesterone receptor protein and mutant ESR1 circulating tumor DNA did not correlate with clinical benefit. GDC-0927 appeared to be well tolerated with pharmacokinetics supporting once-daily dosing.

37258875,Advances in PET imaging of cancer.,Nature reviews. Cancer,2023,"Molecular imaging has experienced enormous advancements in the areas of imaging technology, imaging probe and contrast development, and data quality, as well as machine learning-based data analysis. Positron emission tomography (PET) and its combination with computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as a multimodality PET-CT or PET-MRI system offer a wealth of molecular, functional and morphological data with a single patient scan. Despite the recent technical advances and the availability of dozens of disease-specific contrast and imaging probes, only a few parameters, such as tumour size or the mean tracer uptake, are used for the evaluation of images in clinical practice. Multiparametric in vivo imaging data not only are highly quantitative but also can provide invaluable information about pathophysiology, receptor expression, metabolism, or morphological and functional features of tumours, such as pH, oxygenation or tissue density, as well as pharmacodynamic properties of drugs, to measure drug response with a contrast agent. It can further quantitatively map and spatially resolve the intertumoural and intratumoural heterogeneity, providing insights into tumour vulnerabilities for target-specific therapeutic interventions. Failure to exploit and integrate the full potential of such powerful imaging data may lead to a lost opportunity in which patients do not receive the best possible care. With the desire to implement personalized medicine in the cancer clinic, the full comprehensive diagnostic power of multiplexed imaging should be utilized.",1591

We prospectively evaluated patients with indications for MRI-guided biopsy between January 2021 and May 2022. Exclusion criteria were indication for US-/CT-guided biopsy, contraindication to percutaneous biopsy, inability to lie flat for at least 30 min, claustrophobic, severe obesity, or non-MRI compatible devices. Biopsies were performed by 3 interventional radiologists, with at least 8 years of experience in oncological interventional radiology. Epidemiological, clinical, procedural, and histopathological data were retrospectively collected. From an initial population of 117 patients, 57 patients (32 male, mean age 64 ± 8 y) were finally enrolled. All 57 patients suspected thoraco-abdominal malignant lesions finally underwent MRI-guided percutaneous biopsy. The mean duration of the entire procedure was 37 min (range 28-65 min); the mean duration of the total needle-in-patient time was 10 min (range 6-19 min). Technical and clinical success were obtained for all the biopsies performed. Malignancy was demonstrated in 47/57 (82%) cases and benignancy in the remaining 10/57 (18%) cases. No major complications were detected after the biopsies; two minor compliances (severe pain) occurred and were managed conservatively. Our initial experience demonstrated the technical feasibility and the accuracy of MRI-guided biopsies of thoraco-abdominal masses. The reported data associated with the best comfort for the patient and for the operator make the use of MRI a valid alternative to other methods, especially in lesions that are difficult to approach via US or CT. Interventional MRI is one of the most important innovations available for interventional radiologists. This method will broaden the diagnostic and therapeutic possibilities, allowing treatment of lesions up to now not approachable percutaneously. For this, it is necessary to start publishing the data of the few groups that are developing the method. • To evaluate the use of MRI as a guide for percutaneous biopsies of various districts. • Our preliminary experience confirms experience demonstrated the technical feasibility and the accuracy of MRI-guided biopsies of thoraco-abdominal masses. • Interventional MRI can become the reference method for percutaneous biopsies in particular for lesions with difficult percutaneous approach.",2494

37243694,Prediction of breast cancer risk for sisters of women attending screening.,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,2023,"Risk assessment is important for breast cancer prevention and early detection. We aimed to examine whether common risk factors, mammographic features, and breast cancer risk prediction scores of a woman were associated with breast cancer risk for her sisters. We included 53 051 women from the Karolinska Mammography Project for Risk Prediction of Breast Cancer (KARMA) study. Established risk factors were derived using self-reported questionnaires, mammograms, and single nucleotide polymorphism genotyping. Using the Swedish Multi-Generation Register, we identified 32 198 sisters of the KARMA women (including 5352 KARMA participants and 26 846 nonparticipants). Cox models were used to estimate the hazard ratios of breast cancer for both women and their sisters, respectively. A higher breast cancer polygenic risk score, a history of benign breast disease, and higher breast density in women were associated with an increased risk of breast cancer for both women and their sisters. No statistically significant association was observed between breast microcalcifications and masses in women and breast cancer risk for their sisters. Furthermore, higher breast cancer risk scores in women were associated with an increased risk of breast cancer for their sisters. Specifically, the hazard ratios for breast cancer per 1 standard deviation increase in age-adjusted KARMA, Breast and Ovarian Analysis of Disease Incidence and Carrier Estimation Algorithm (BOADICEA), and Tyrer-Cuzick risk scores were 1.16 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.07 to 1.27), 1.23 (95% CI = 1.12 to 1.35), and 1.21 (95% CI = 1.11 to 1.32), respectively.

37231071,Use of individualized 3D-printed models of pancreatic cancer to improve surgeons' anatomic understanding and surgical planning.,European radiology,2023,"Three-dimensional (3D) printing has been increasingly used to create accurate patient-specific 3D-printed models from medical imaging data. We aimed to evaluate the utility of 3D-printed models in the localization and understanding of pancreatic cancer for surgeons before pancreatic surgery. Between March and September 2021, we prospectively enrolled 10 patients with suspected pancreatic cancer who were scheduled for surgery. We created an individualized 3D-printed model from preoperative CT images. Six surgeons (three staff and three residents) evaluated the CT images before and after the presentation of the 3D-printed model using a 7-item questionnaire (understanding of anatomy and pancreatic cancer [Q1-4], preoperative planning [Q5], and education for trainees or patients [Q6-7]) on a 5-point scale. Survey scores on Q1-5 before and after the presentation of the 3D-printed model were compared. Q6-7 assessed the 3D-printed model's effects on education compared to CT. Subgroup analysis was performed between staff and residents. After the 3D-printed model presentation, survey scores improved in all five questions (before 3.90 vs. after 4.56, p < 0.001), with a mean improvement of 0.57‒0.93. Staff and resident scores improved after a 3D-printed model presentation (p < 0.05), except for Q4 in the resident group. The mean difference was higher among the staff than among the residents (staff: 0.50‒0.97 vs. residents: 0.27‒0.90). The scores of the 3D-printed model for education were high (trainees: 4.47 vs. patients: 4.60) compared to CT. The 3D-printed model of pancreatic cancer improved surgeons' understanding of individual patients' pancreatic cancer and surgical planning. The 3D-printed model of pancreatic cancer can be created using a preoperative CT image, which not only assists surgeons in surgical planning but also serves as a valuable educational resource for patients and students. • A personalized 3D-printed pancreatic cancer model provides more intuitive information than CT, allowing surgeons to better visualize the tumor's location and relationship to neighboring organs. • In particular, the survey score was higher among staff who performed the surgery than among residents. • Individual patient pancreatic cancer models have the potential to be used for personalized patient education as well as resident education.",2360

Alternative treatment regimens, such as immunotherapies, are known to intensify the inflammatory response in the treatment field. Follow-up imaging in these scenarios often mimics disease progression on conventional MRI, making accurate evaluation extremely challenging. To this end, revised criteria for assessment of treatment response in high-grade gliomas were successfully proposed by the RANO Working Group to distinguish pseudoprogression from true progression, with intrinsic constraints related to the postcontrast T1-weighted MRI sequence. To address these existing limitations, our group proposes a more objective and quantifiable ""treatment agnostic"" model, integrating into the RANO criteria advanced multimodal neuroimaging techniques, such as diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), dynamic susceptibility contrast-perfusion weighted imaging (DSC-PWI), dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE)-MRI, MR spectroscopy, and amino acid-based positron emission tomography (PET) imaging tracers, along with artificial intelligence (AI) tools (radiomics, radiogenomics, and radiopathomics) and molecular information to address this complex issue of treatment-related changes versus tumor progression in ""real-time"", particularly in the early posttreatment window. Our perspective delineates the potential of incorporating multimodal neuroimaging techniques to improve consistency and automation for the assessment of early treatment response in neuro-oncology.",1561

Sixty-six patients with pathologically confirmed NPC underwent nasopharynx and neck examination using a 3.0-T MRI system. Transverse T2-weighted fast spin-echo (FSE) sequence, transverse T1-weighted FSE sequence, post-contrast transverse T1-weighted FSE sequence, and post-contrast coronal T1-weighted FSE were obtained by both ACS and PI techniques, respectively. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), and duration of scanning of both sets of images analyzed by ACS and PI techniques were compared. The images from the ACS and PI techniques were scored for lesion detection, margin sharpness of lesions, artifacts, and overall image quality using the 5-point Likert scale. The examination time with ACS technique was significantly shorter than that with PI technique (p < 0.0001). The comparison of SNR and CNR showed that ACS technique was significantly superior with PI technique (p < 0.005). Qualitative image analysis showed that the scores of lesion detection, margin sharpness of lesions, artifacts, and overall image quality were higher in the ACS sequences than those in the PI sequences (p < 0.0001). Inter-observer agreement was evaluated for all qualitative indicators for each method, in which the results showed satisfactory-to-excellent agreement (p < 0.0001). Compared with the PI technique, the ACS technique for MR examination of NPC can not only shorten scanning time but also improve image quality. The artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted compressed sensing (ACS) technique shortens examination time for patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma, while improving the image quality and examination success rate, which will benefit more patients. • Compared with the parallel imaging (PI) technique, the artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted compressed sensing (ACS) technique not only reduced examination time, but also improved image quality. • Artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted compressed sensing (ACS) pulls the state-of-the-art deep learning technique into the reconstruction procedure and helps find an optimal balance of imaging speed and image quality.",2326

However, it is essential to critically evaluate the performance of AI before it can become a modality used for independent mammographic interpretation. Purpose To evaluate the reported standalone performances of AI for interpretation of digital mammography and digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT). Materials and Methods A systematic search was conducted in PubMed, Google Scholar, Embase (Ovid), and Web of Science databases for studies published from January 2017 to June 2022. Sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) values were reviewed. Study quality was assessed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2 and Comparative (QUADAS-2 and QUADAS-C, respectively). A random effects meta-analysis and meta-regression analysis were performed for overall studies and for different study types (reader studies vs historic cohort studies) and imaging techniques (digital mammography vs DBT). Results In total, 16 studies that include 1 108 328 examinations in 497 091 women were analyzed (six reader studies, seven historic cohort studies on digital mammography, and four studies on DBT).

This single-institutional retrospective study included 69 consecutive patients with Cushing's syndrome who underwent preoperative pituitary MRI, including cMRI, dMRI, and hrMRI, between January 2016 to December 2020. Reference standards were established by using all available imaging, clinical, surgical, and pathological resources. The diagnostic performance of cMRI, dMRI, and hrMRI for identifying pituitary microadenomas was independently evaluated by two experienced neuroradiologists. The area under the receiver operating characteristics curves (AUCs) were compared between protocols for each reader by using the DeLong test to assess the diagnostic performance for identifying pituitary microadenomas. The inter-observer agreement was assessed by using the κ analysis. The diagnostic performance of hrMRI (AUC, 0.95-0.97) was higher than cMRI (AUC, 0.74-0.75; p ≤ .002) and dMRI (AUC, 0.59-0.68; p ≤ .001) for identifying pituitary microadenomas. The sensitivity and specificity of hrMRI were 90-93% and 100%, respectively. There were 78% (18/23) to 82% (14/17) of the patients, who were misdiagnosed on cMRI and dMRI and correctly diagnosed on hrMRI. The inter-observer agreement for identifying pituitary microadenomas was moderate on cMRI (κ = 0.50), moderate on dMRI (κ = 0.57), and almost perfect on hrMRI (κ = 0.91), respectively. The hrMRI showed higher diagnostic performance than cMRI and dMRI for identifying pituitary microadenomas in patients with Cushing's syndrome. • The diagnostic performance of hrMRI was higher than cMRI and dMRI for identifying pituitary microadenomas in Cushing's syndrome. • About 80% of patients, who were misdiagnosed on cMRI and dMRI, were correctly diagnosed on hrMRI. • The inter-observer agreement for identifying pituitary microadenomas was almost perfect on hrMRI.",2127
37209125,"Deep learning for detection of iso-dense, obscure masses in mammographically dense breasts.",European radiology,2023,"To analyze the performance of deep learning in isodense/obscure masses in dense breasts. To build and validate a deep learning (DL) model using core radiology principles and analyze its performance in isodense/obscure masses. To show performance on screening mammography as well as diagnostic mammography distribution. This was a retrospective, single-institution, multi-centre study with external validation. For model building, we took a 3-pronged approach. First, we explicitly taught the network to learn features other than density differences: such as spiculations and architectural distortion. Second, we used the opposite breast to enable the detection of asymmetries. Third, we systematically enhanced each image by piece-wise-linear transformation. We tested the network on a diagnostic mammography dataset (2569 images with 243 cancers, January to June 2018) and a screening mammography dataset (2146 images with 59 cancers, patient recruitment from January to April 2021) from a different centre (external validation). When trained with our proposed technique (and compared with baseline network), sensitivity for malignancy increased from 82.7 to 84.7% at 0.2 False positives per image (FPI) in the diagnostic mammography dataset, 67.9 to 73.8% in the subset of patients with dense breasts, 74.6 to 85.3 in the subset of patients with isodense/obscure cancers and 84.9 to 88.7 in an external validation test set with a screening mammography distribution. We showed that our sensitivity exceeded currently reported values (0.90 at 0.2 FPI) on a public benchmark dataset (INBreast). Modelling traditional mammographic teaching into a DL framework can help improve cancer detection accuracy in dense breasts. Incorporating medical knowledge into neural network design can help us overcome some limitations associated with specific modalities. In this paper, we show how one such deep neural network can help improve performance on mammographically dense breasts. • Although state-of-the-art deep learning networks achieve good results in cancer detection in mammography in general, isodense, obscure masses and mammographically dense breasts posed a challenge to deep learning networks. • Collaborative network design and incorporation of traditional radiology teaching into the deep learning approach helped mitigate the problem. • The accuracy of deep learning networks may be translatable to different patient distributions. We showed the results of our network on screening as well as diagnostic mammography datasets.",2531
37191919,Comparison of neuroimaging features of histiocytic neoplasms with central nervous system involvement: a retrospective study of 121 adult patients.,European radiology,2023,"To compare neuroimaging characteristics of three types of histiocytoses, namely Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH), Erdheim-Chester disease (ECD), and Rosai-Dorfman disease (RDD), with central nervous system (CNS) involvement. A total of 121 adult patients with histiocytoses (77 LCH, 37 ECD, and 7 RDD) and CNS involvement were retrospectively included. Histiocytoses were diagnosed based on histopathological findings combined with suggestive clinical and imaging features. Brain and dedicated pituitary MRIs were systematically analyzed for tumorous, vascular, degenerative lesions, sinus, and orbital involvement and for hypothalamic pituitary axis involvement. Endocrine disorders, including diabetes insipidus and central hypogonadism, were more common in LCH patients than in ECD and RDD patients (p < 0.001). In LCH, tumorous lesions were mostly solitary (85.7%), located in the hypothalamic pituitary region (92.9%), and without peritumoral edema (92.9%), while in ECD and RDD, tumorous lesions were often multiple (ECD: 81.3%, RDD: 85.7%), their distribution was more widespread with meninges mostly involved (ECD: 75%, RDD: 71.4%), and they most likely presented with peritumoral edema (ECD: 50%, RDD: 57.1%; all p ≤ 0.020). Vascular involvement was an exclusive imaging characteristic of ECD (17.2%), which was not observed in LCH or RDD; this was also associated with a higher risk of death (p = 0.013, hazard ratio = 11.09). The typical characteristic of adult CNS-LCH was endocrine disorders with radiological findings limited to the hypothalamic pituitary axis. The pattern of multiple tumorous lesions with predominant involvement of meninges was the main manifestation of CNS-ECD and CNS-RDD, while vascular involvement was pathognomonic for ECD and associated with poor prognosis. Involvement of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis is the typical imaging characteristic of Langerhans cell histiocytosis. Multiple tumorous lesions, predominantly involving but not limited to meninges, occur in most Erdheim-Chester disease and Rosai-Dorfman disease patients. Vascular involvement occurs only in Erdheim-Chester disease patients. • The different distribution patterns of brain tumorous lesions can help differentiate among LCH, ECD, and RDD. • Vascular involvement was an exclusive imaging finding of ECD and was associated with high mortality. • Some cases with atypical imaging manifestations were reported to further expand the knowledge on these diseases.",2473

From December 2020 to January 2021, patients with liver MRI were prospectively included. For qualitative analysis, sequence quality, presence of artifacts, conspicuity, and presumed nature of the smallest lesion were assessed using the chi-squared and McNemar tests. For quantitative analysis, number of liver lesions, size of the smallest lesion, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) in both sequences were assessed using the paired Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) and kappa coefficients were used to assess agreement between the two readers. One hundred and twelve patients were evaluated. Overall image quality (p = .006), artifacts (p < .001), and conspicuity of the smallest lesion (p = .001) were significantly better for the DL HASTE sequence than for the T2-weighted BLADE sequence. Significantly more liver lesions were detected with the DL HASTE sequence (356 lesions) than with the T2-weighted BLADE sequence (320 lesions; p < .001). CNR was significantly higher for the DL HASTE sequence (p < .001). SNR was higher for the T2-weighted BLADE sequence (p < .001). Interreader agreement was moderate to excellent depending on the sequence. Of the 41 supernumerary lesions visible only on the DL HASTE sequence, 38 (93%) were true-positives. The DL HASTE sequence can be used to improve image quality and contrast and reduces artifacts, allowing the detection of more liver lesions than with the T2-weighted BLADE sequence. The DL HASTE sequence is superior to the T2-weighted BLADE sequence for the detection of focal liver lesions and can be used in daily practice as a standard sequence. • The half-Fourier acquisition single-shot turbo spin echo sequence with deep learning reconstruction (DL HASTE sequence) has better overall image quality, reduced artifacts (particularly motion artifacts), and improved contrast, allowing the detection of more liver lesions than with the T2-weighted BLADE sequence. • The acquisition time of the DL HASTE sequence is at least eight times faster (21 s) than that of the T2-weighted BLADE sequence (3-5 min). • The DL HASTE sequence could replace the conventional T2-weighted BLADE sequence to meet the growing indication for hepatic MRI in clinical practice, given its diagnostic and time-saving performance.",2540

A retrospective database search identified 3158 asymptomatic Korean women who consecutively underwent screening DM between January and December 2019 without AI-CAD support, and screening DM between February and July 2020 with image interpretation aided by AI-CAD in a tertiary referral hospital using single reading. Propensity score matching was used to match the DM with AI-CAD group in a 1:1 ratio with the DM without AI-CAD group according to age, breast density, experience level of the interpreting radiologist, and screening round. Performance measures were compared with the McNemar test and generalized estimating equations. A total of 1579 women who underwent DM with AI-CAD were matched with 1579 women who underwent DM without AI-CAD. Radiologists showed higher specificity (96% [1500 of 1563] vs 91.6% [1430 of 1561]; p < 0.001) and lower abnormal interpretation rates (AIR) (4.9% [77 of 1579] vs 9.2% [145 of 1579]; p < 0.001) with AI-CAD than without. There was no significant difference in the cancer detection rate (CDR) (AI-CAD vs no AI-CAD, 8.9 vs 8.9 per 1000 examinations; p = 0.999), sensitivity (87.5% vs 77.8%; p = 0.999), and positive predictive value for biopsy (PPV AI-CAD increases the specificity for radiologists without decreasing sensitivity as a supportive tool in the single reading of DM for breast cancer screening. This study shows that AI-CAD could improve the specificity of radiologists' DM interpretation in the single reading system without decreasing sensitivity, suggesting that it can benefit patients by reducing false positive and recall rates. • In this retrospective-matched cohort study (DM without AI-CAD vs DM with AI-CAD), radiologists showed higher specificity and lower AIR when AI-CAD was used to support decision-making in DM screening. • CDR, sensitivity, and PPV for biopsy did not differ with and without AI-CAD support.",2111

A primary dataset including 1000 cases with 11,686 BMs was employed to construct the model, while an independent dataset including 100 cases with 1069 BMs from other hospitals was used to examine the generalizability. The potential of the model for clinical use was also evaluated by comparing its performance in BM detection and segmentation to that of radiologists, and comparing radiologists' lesion detecting performances with and without model assistance. Our model yielded a recall of 0.88, a dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 0.90, a positive predictive value (PPV) of 0.93 and a false positives per patient (FP) of 1.01 in the test set, and a recall of 0.85, a DSC of 0.89, a PPV of 0.93, and a FP of 1.07 in dataset from other hospitals. With the model's assistance, the BM detection rates of 4 radiologists improved significantly, ranging from 5.2 to 15.1% (all p < 0.001), and also for detecting small BMs with diameter ≤ 5 mm (ranging from 7.2 to 27.0%, all p < 0.001). The proposed model enables accurate BM detection and segmentation with higher sensitivity and less time consumption, showing the potential to augment radiologists' performance in detecting BM. This study offers a promising computer-aided tool to assist the brain metastasis detection and segmentation in routine clinical practice for cancer patients. • The GHR-CNN could accurately detect and segment BM on contrast-enhanced 3D-T1W images. • The GHR-CNN improved the BM detection rate of radiologists, including the detection of small lesions. • The GHR-CNN enabled automated segmentation of BM in a very short time.",1889

This multicenter retrospective study included the preoperative CT of PTC patients who were divided into the development, internal, and external test sets. The region of interest of the primary tumor was outlined manually on the CT images by a radiologist who has eight years of experience. With the use of the CT images and lesions masks, the deep learning (DL) signature was developed by the DenseNet combined with convolutional block attention module. One-way analysis of variance and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator were used to select features, and a support vector machine was used to construct the radiomics signature. Random forest was used to combine the DL, radiomics, and clinical signature to perform the final prediction. The receiver operating characteristic curve, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were used by two radiologists (R1 and R2) to evaluate and compare the AI system. For the internal and external test set, the AI system achieved excellent performance with AUCs of 0.84 and 0.81, higher than the DL (p = .03, .82), radiomics (p < .001, .04), and clinical model (p < .001, .006).

Our aim was to analyze the role of low skeletal muscle mass (LSMM) and fat areas for prognosis of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and treatment response in patients with primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL). Overall, 61 patients (29 female patients, 47.5%) with a mean age of 63.8 ± 12.2 years, range 23-81 years, were identified in the data base between 2012 and 2020 with sufficient clinical and imaging data. Body composition assessment, comprising LSMM and visceral and subcutaneous fat areas, was performed on one axial slice on L3-height derived from staging computed tomography (CT) images. DLT was assessed during chemotherapy in clinical routine. Objective response rate (ORR) was measured on following magnetic resonance images of the head accordingly to the Cheson criteria. Twenty-eight patients had DLT (45.9%). Regression analysis revealed that LSMM was associated with objective response, OR = 5.19 (95% CI 1.35-19.94, p = 0.02) (univariable regression), and OR = 4.23 (95% CI 1.03- 17.38, p = 0.046) (multivariable regression). None of the body composition parameters could predict DLT. Patients with normal visceral to subcutaneous ratio (VSR) could be treated with more chemotherapy cycles compared to patients with high VSR (mean, 4.25 vs 2.94, p = 0.03). Patients with ORR had higher muscle density values compared to patients with stable and/or progressive disease (34.46 ± vs 28.18 ± HU, p = 0.02). LSMM is strongly associated with objective response in patients with PCNSL. Body composition parameters cannot predict DLT. Low skeletal muscle mass on computed tomography (CT) is an independent prognostic factor of poor treatment response in central nervous system lymphoma. Analysis of the skeletal musculature on staging CT should be implemented into the clinical routine in this tumor entity. • Low skeletal muscle mass is strongly associated with the objective response rate. • No body composition parameters could predict dose-limiting toxicity.",2126

(2) How well do ML systems perform in liver CT imaging? (3) What are the clinical applications of ML in liver CT imaging? A systematic review was carried out according to the guidelines from the PRISMA-P statement. The search string focused on studies containing content relating to artificial intelligence, liver, and computed tomography. One hundred ninety-one studies were included in the study. ML was applied to CT liver imaging by image analysis without clinicians' intervention in majority of studies while in newer studies the fusion of ML method with clinical intervention have been identified. Several were documented to perform very accurately on reliable but small data. Most models identified were deep learning-based, mainly using convolutional neural networks. Potentially many clinical applications of ML to CT liver imaging have been identified through our review including liver and its lesion segmentation and classification, segmentation of vascular structure inside the liver, fibrosis and cirrhosis staging, metastasis prediction, and evaluation of chemotherapy. Several studies attempted to provide transparent result of the model. To make the model convenient for a clinical application, prospective clinical validation studies are in urgent call.

A total of 421 patients with histopathologically proved EC (101 recurrence vs. 320 non-recurrence EC) from four medical centers were included in this retrospective study, and were divided into the training (n = 235), internal validation (n = 102), and external validation (n = 84) cohorts. In total, 1702 radiomics features were respectively extracted from areas with different extensions for each patient. The extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) classifier was applied to establish the clinicopathological model (CM), radiomics model (RM), and fusion model (FM). The performance of the established models was assessed by the discrimination, calibration, and clinical utility. Kaplan-Meier analysis was conducted to further determine the prognostic value of the models by evaluating the differences in recurrence-free survival (RFS) between the high- and low-risk patients of recurrence. The FMs showed better performance compared with the models based on clinicopathological or radiomics features alone but with a reduced tendency when the peritumoral area (PA) was extended. The FM based on intratumoral area (IA) [FM (IA)] had the optimal performance in predicting the recurrence risk in terms of the ROC, calibration curve, and decision curve analysis. Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed that high-risk patients of recurrence defined by FM (IA) had a worse RFS than low-risk ones of recurrence. The FM integrating intratumoral radiomics features and clinicopathological factors could be a valuable predictor for the recurrence risk of EC patients. An accurate prediction based on our developed FM (IA) for the recurrence risk of EC could facilitate making an individualized therapeutic decision and help avoid under- or over-treatment, therefore improving the prognosis of patients. • The fusion model combined clinicopathological factors and radiomics features exhibits the highest performance compared with the clinicopathological model and radiomics model. • Although higher values of area under the curve were observed for all fusion models, the performance tended to decrease with the extension of the peritumoral region. • Identifying patients with different risks of recurrence, the developed models can be used to facilitate individualized management.",2434

A total of 208 patients with pathologically confirmed rectal cancer from two hospitals were prospectively enrolled. Intra- and peritumoral features were extracted separately from T2WI images and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator was used to screen the most valuable radiomics features. Clinical-radiomics nomogram was developed by radiomics signatures and the most predictive clinical parameters. Prognostic model for 3-year recurrence-free survival (RFS) was constructed using univariate and multivariate Cox analysis. For TD, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for intratumoral radiomics model was 0.956, 0.823, and 0.860 in the training cohort, test cohort, and external validation cohort, respectively. AUC for the peritumoral radiomics model was 0.929, 0.906, and 0.773 in the training cohort, test cohort, and external validation cohort, respectively.

37158725,"Adnexal Lesion Imaging: Past, Present, and Future.",Radiology,2023,"Currently, imaging is part of the standard of care for patients with adnexal lesions prior to definitive management. Imaging can identify a physiologic finding or classic benign lesion that can be followed up conservatively. When one of these entities is not present, imaging is used to determine the probability of ovarian cancer prior to surgical consultation. Since the inclusion of imaging in the evaluation of adnexal lesions in the 1970s, the rate of surgery for benign lesions has decreased. More recently, data-driven Ovarian-Adnexal Reporting and Data System (O-RADS) scoring systems for US and MRI with standardized lexicons have been developed to allow for assignment of a cancer risk score, with the goal of further decreasing unnecessary interventions while expediting the care of patients with ovarian cancer. US is used as the initial modality for the assessment of adnexal lesions, while MRI is used when there is a clinical need for increased specificity and positive predictive value for the diagnosis of cancer. This article will review how the treatment of adnexal lesions has changed due to imaging over the decades; the current data supporting the use of US, CT, and MRI to determine the likelihood of cancer; and future directions of adnexal imaging for the early detection of ovarian cancer.",1315

37154952,Prostate cancer screening-stepping forward with MRI.,European radiology,2023,"To comprehensively review the literature on the integration of MRI as a diagnostic tool in prostate cancer screening and offer practical recommendations for optimising its use. Existing research studies, clinical guidelines and expert opinions were reviewed to support the optimisation standards for MRI use in screening. Consolidated screening principles were used to make appropriate recommendations regarding the integration of MRI into the diagnostic pathway. To strike a balance between the potential benefits of early detection on mortality and minimising the harm of over-diagnosing indolent cancers, it is necessary to have a clear understanding of the context of MRI use. The key to optimisation is patient selections and MRI-targeted biopsies. For men at higher-than-average risk, it is essential to use screening-specific MRI protocols and establish accuracy levels and interpretation criteria. Optimisation of readings by the automation of data acquisition, image quality monitoring, post-processing, radiologist certification and deep-learning computer-aided software is needed. The optimal utilisation of MRI involves its integration into a multistep diagnostic pathway, supported by a quality-assured and cost-effective infrastructure that ensures community-wide access to imaging. MRI in the prostate cancer screening pathway can bring substantial diagnostic benefits. By carefully considering its advantages, limitations and safety concerns and integrating it into a multistep diagnostic pathway, clinicians can improve outcomes while minimising harm to screening participants. The manuscript discusses the role of MRI in prostate cancer screening, highlighting its potential to improve accuracy and reduce overdiagnosis. It emphasises the importance of optimising protocols and integrating MRI into a multistep diagnostic pathway for successfully delivering screening benefits. • Population screening for prostate cancer is a new indication for prostate MRI that allows the detection of high-risk cancers while reducing the need for biopsies and associated harm. • To optimise prostate cancer screening using MRI, it is essential to redefine MRI protocols; establish accuracy levels, reliability and interpretation criteria; and optimise reading (including post-processing, image quality, radiologist certification, and deep-learning computer-aided software). • The optimal utilisation of MRI for prostate cancer screening would involve its integration into a multistep diagnostic pathway, supported by a quality-assured and cost-effective infrastructure that ensures community-wide access to imaging.",2619
37150781,Deep learning referral suggestion and tumour discrimination using explainable artificial intelligence applied to multiparametric MRI.,European radiology,2023,"An appropriate and fast clinical referral suggestion is important for intra-axial mass-like lesions (IMLLs) in the emergency setting. We aimed to apply an interpretable deep learning (DL) system to multiparametric MRI to obtain clinical referral suggestion for IMLLs, and to validate it in the setting of nontraumatic emergency neuroradiology. A DL system was developed in 747 patients with IMLLs ranging 30 diseases who underwent pre- and post-contrast T1-weighted (T1CE), FLAIR, and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI). A DL system that segments IMLLs, classifies tumourous conditions, and suggests clinical referral among surgery, systematic work-up, medical treatment, and conservative treatment, was developed. The system was validated in an independent cohort of 130 emergency patients, and performance in referral suggestion and tumour discrimination was compared with that of radiologists using receiver operating characteristics curve, precision-recall curve analysis, and confusion matrices. Multiparametric interpretable visualisation of high-relevance regions from layer-wise relevance propagation overlaid on contrast-enhanced T1WI and DWI was analysed. The DL system provided correct referral suggestions in 94 of 130 patients (72.3%) and performed comparably to radiologists (accuracy 72.6%, McNemar test; p = .942). For distinguishing tumours from non-tumourous conditions, the DL system (AUC, 0.90 and AUPRC, 0.94) performed similarly to human readers (AUC, 0.81~0.92, and AUPRC, 0.88~0.95). Solid portions of tumours showed a high overlap of relevance, but non-tumours did not (Dice coefficient 0.77 vs. 0.33, p < .001), demonstrating the DL's decision. Our DL system could appropriately triage patients using multiparametric MRI and provide interpretability through multiparametric heatmaps, and may thereby aid neuroradiologic diagnoses in emergency settings. Our AI triages patients with raw MRI images to clinical referral pathways in brain intra-axial mass-like lesions. We demonstrate that the decision is based on the relative relevance between contrast-enhanced T1-weighted and diffusion-weighted images, providing explainability across multiparametric MRI data. • A deep learning (DL) system using multiparametric MRI suggested clinical referral to patients with intra-axial mass-like lesions (IMLLs) similar to radiologists (accuracy 72.3% vs. 72.6%). • In the differentiation of tumourous and non-tumourous conditions, the DL system (AUC, 0.90) performed similar with radiologists (AUC, 0.81-0.92). • The DL's decision basis for differentiating tumours from non-tumours can be quantified using multiparametric heatmaps obtained via the layer-wise relevance propagation method.",2702

Forty-four patients with PAs were prospectively enrolled. Tumor consistency was evaluated at surgery as either soft or hard, followed by histological assessment. In vivo DR-CSI was performed and spectra were segmented following to a peak-based strategy into four compartments, designated A (low ADC), B (mediate ADC, short T2), C (mediate ADC, long T2), and D (high ADC). The corresponding volume fractions ([Formula: see text], [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text]) along with the ADC and T2 values were calculated and assessed using univariable analysis for discrimination between hard and soft PAs. Predictors of EOR > 95% were analyzed using logistic regression model and receiver-operating-characteristic analysis. Tumor consistency was classified as soft (n = 28) or hard (n = 16). Hard PAs presented higher [Formula: see text] (p = 0.001) and lower [Formula: see text] (p = 0.013) than soft PAs, while no significant difference was found in other parameters. [Formula: see text] significantly correlated with the level of collagen content (r = 0.448, p = 0.002). Knosp grade (odds ratio [OR], 0.299; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.124-0.716; p = 0.007) and [Formula: see text] (OR, 0.834, per 1% increase; 95% CI, 0.731-0.951; p = 0.007) were independently associated with EOR > 95%.

37148350,Preoperative contrast-enhanced CT-based radiomics nomogram for differentiating benign and malignant primary retroperitoneal tumors.,European radiology,2023,"This study evaluated the ability of a preoperative contrast-enhanced CT (CECT)-based radiomics nomogram to differentiate benign and malignant primary retroperitoneal tumors (PRT). Images and data from 340 patients with pathologically confirmed PRT were randomly placed into training (n = 239) and validation sets (n = 101). Two radiologists independently analyzed all CT images and made measurements. Key characteristics were identified through least absolute shrinkage selection combined with four machine-learning classifiers (support vector machine, generalized linear model, random forest, and artificial neural network back propagation) to create a radiomics signature. Demographic data and CECT characteristics were analyzed to formulate a clinico-radiological model. Independent clinical variables were merged with the best-performing radiomics signature to develop a radiomics nomogram. The discrimination capacity and clinical value of three models were quantified by the area under the receiver operating characteristics (AUC), accuracy, and decision curve analysis. The radiomics nomogram was able to consistently differentiate between benign and malignant PRT in the training and validation datasets, with AUCs of 0.923 and 0.907, respectively. Decision curve analysis manifested that the nomogram achieved higher clinical net benefits than did separate use of the radiomics signature and clinico-radiological model. The preoperative nomogram is valuable for differentiating between benign and malignant PRT; it can also aid in treatment planning. • A noninvasive and accurate preoperative determination of benign and malignant PRT is crucial to identifying suitable treatments and predicting disease prognosis. • Associating the radiomics signature with clinical factors facilitates differentiation of malignant from benign PRT with improved diagnostic efficacy (AUC) and accuracy from 0.772 to 0.907 and from 0.723 to 0.842, respectively, compared with the clinico-radiological model alone. • For some PRT with anatomically special locations and when biopsy is extremely difficult and risky, a radiomics nomogram may provide a promising preoperative alternative for distinguishing benignity and malignancy.",2220

The prospective, population-based MBTST, with 14,848 participating women, was designed to compare one-view digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) to two-view digital mammography (DM) in breast cancer screening. False-positive recall rates, radiographic appearances, and biopsy rates were analyzed. Comparisons were made between DBT, DM, and DBT + DM, both in total and in trial year 1 compared to trial years 2 to 5, with numbers, percentages, and 95% confidence intervals (CI). The false-positive recall rate was higher with DBT, 1.6% (95% CI 1.4; 1.8), compared to screening with DM, 0.8% (95% CI 0.7; 1.0). The proportion of the radiographic appearance of stellate distortion was 37.3% (91/244) with DBT, compared to 24.0% (29/121) with DM.

The percentage of stellate distortion with DBT was 50% (19/38) trial year 1 compared to 35.0% (72/206) trial years 2 to 5. The higher false-positive recall rate with DBT compared to DM was mainly due to an increased detection of stellate findings. The proportion of these findings, as well as the DBT false-positive recall rate, was reduced after the first trial year. Assessment of false-positive recalls gives information on potential benefits and side effects in DBT screening. • The false-positive recall rate in a prospective digital breast tomosynthesis screening trial was higher compared to digital mammography, but still low compared to other trials. • The higher false-positive recall rate with digital breast tomosynthesis was mainly due to an increased detection of stellate findings; the proportion of these findings was reduced after the first trial year.",1945

We included 230 NSCLC patients with BM treated at our hospital between January 2017 and December 2021 and 80 patients treated at another hospital between July 2014 and October 2021 to form the primary and external validation cohorts, respectively. All patients underwent contrast-enhanced T1-weighted (T1C) and T2-weighted (T2W) MRI, and radiomics features were extracted from both the tumor active area (TAA) and peritumoral edema area (POA) for each patient. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) was used to identify the most predictive features. Radiomics signatures (RSs) were constructed using logistic regression analysis. For predicting the EGFR mutation status, the created RS-EGFR-TAA and RS-EGFR- POA showed similar performance. By combination of TAA and POA, the multi-region combined RS (RS-EGFR-Com) achieved the highest prediction performance, with AUCs of 0.896, 0.856, and 0.889 in the primary training, internal validation, and external validation cohort, respectively.

The MIPA observational study enrolled women aged 18-80 years with newly diagnosed breast cancer destined to have surgery as the primary treatment, in 27 centres worldwide. Mastectomy and reoperation rates were compared using non-parametric tests and multivariable analysis. A total of 5828 patients entered analysis, 2763 (47.4%) did not undergo MRI (noMRI subgroup) and 3065 underwent MRI (52.6%); of the latter, 2441/3065 (79.7%) underwent MRI with preoperative intent (P-MRI subgroup), 510/3065 (16.6%) D-MRI, and 114/3065 S-MRI (3.7%). The reoperation rate was 10.5% for S-MRI, 8.2% for D-MRI, and 8.5% for P-MRI, while it was 11.7% for noMRI (p ≤ 0.023 for comparisons with D-MRI and P-MRI). The overall mastectomy rate (first-line mastectomy plus conversions from conserving surgery to mastectomy) was 39.5% for S-MRI, 36.2% for P-MRI, 24.1% for D-MRI, and 18.0% for noMRI. At multivariable analysis, using noMRI as reference, the odds ratios for overall mastectomy were 2.4 (p < 0.001) for S-MRI, 1.0 (p = 0.957) for D-MRI, and 1.9 (p < 0.001) for P-MRI. Patients from the D-MRI subgroup had the lowest overall mastectomy rate (24.1%) among MRI subgroups and the lowest reoperation rate (8.2%) together with P-MRI (8.5%).

Inversion recovery (IR) imaging may have the potential to improve visualization without the necessity to apply contrast agent. Forty-four patients (mean age 64 years, female 33%) scheduled for MR-guided thermoablation due to liver malignancies (hepatocellular carcinoma or metastases) were prospectively included in this study between March 2020 and April 2022. Fifty-one liver lesions were intra-procedurally characterized before treatment. Unenhanced T1-VIBE was acquired as part of the standard imaging protocol. Additionally, T1-modified look-locker images were acquired with eight different inversion times (TI) between 148 and 1743 ms. Lesion-to-liver contrast (LLC) was compared between T1-VIBE and IR images for each TI. T1 relaxation times for liver lesions and liver parenchyma were calculated. Mean LLC in T1-VIBE sequence was 0.3 ± 0.1. In IR images, LLC was highest at TI 228 ms (1.04 ± 1.1) and significantly higher compared to T1-VIBE (p < 0.001). In subgroup analysis, lesions of colorectal carcinoma showed the highest LLC at 228 ms (1.14 ± 1.4), and hepatocellular carcinoma showed the highest LLC at 548 ms (1.06 ± 1.16). T1-relaxation times in liver lesions were higher compared to the adjacent liver parenchyma (1184 ± 456 vs. 654 ± 96 ms, p < 0.001). IR imaging is promising to provide improved visualization during unenhanced MR-guided liver interventions compared to standard T1-VIBE sequence when using specific TI.

Purpose To demonstrate that artificial intelligence (AI) software applied to breast US images obtained with low-cost portable equipment and by minimally trained observers could accurately classify palpable breast masses for triage in a low-resource setting. Materials and Methods This prospective multicenter study evaluated participants with at least one palpable mass who were enrolled in a hospital in Jalisco, Mexico, from December 2017 through May 2021. Orthogonal US images were obtained first with portable US with and without calipers of any findings at the site of lump and adjacent tissue. Then women were imaged with standard-of-care (SOC) US with Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System assessments by a radiologist. After exclusions, 758 masses in 300 women were analyzable by AI, with outputs of benign, probably benign, suspicious, and malignant. Sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) were determined. Results The mean patient age ± SD was 50.0 years ± 12.5 (range, 18-92 years) and mean largest lesion diameter was 13 mm ± 8 (range, 2-54 mm). Of 758 masses, 360 (47.5%) were palpable and 56 (7.4%) malignant, including six ductal carcinoma in situ. AI correctly identified 47 or 48 of 49 women (96%-98%) with cancer with either portable US or SOC US images, with AUCs of 0.91 and 0.95, respectively. One circumscribed invasive ductal carcinoma was classified as probably benign with SOC US, ipsilateral to a spiculated invasive ductal carcinoma.

37129490,Automation Bias in Mammography: The Impact of Artificial Intelligence BI-RADS Suggestions on Reader Performance.,Radiology,2023,"Background Automation bias (the propensity for humans to favor suggestions from automated decision-making systems) is a known source of error in human-machine interactions, but its implications regarding artificial intelligence (AI)-aided mammography reading are unknown. Purpose To determine how automation bias can affect inexperienced, moderately experienced, and very experienced radiologists when reading mammograms with the aid of an artificial intelligence (AI) system. Materials and Methods In this prospective experiment, 27 radiologists read 50 mammograms and provided their Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) assessment assisted by a purported AI system. Mammograms were obtained between January 2017 and December 2019 and were presented in two randomized sets. The first was a training set of 10 mammograms, with the correct BI-RADS category suggested by the AI system. The second was a set of 40 mammograms in which an incorrect BI-RADS category was suggested for 12 mammograms. Reader performance, degree of bias in BI-RADS scoring, perceived accuracy of the AI system, and reader confidence in their own BI-RADS ratings were assessed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and repeated-measures ANOVA followed by post hoc tests and Kruskal-Wallis tests followed by the Dunn post hoc test.

37115216,Gd-EOB MRI for HCC subtype differentiation in a western population according to the 5,European radiology,2023,"To investigate the value of gadoxetic acid (Gd-EOB)-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for noninvasive subtype differentiation of HCCs according to the 5 This retrospective study included 262 resected lesions in 240 patients with preoperative Gd-EOB-enhanced MRI. Subtypes were assigned by two pathologists. Gd-EOB-enhanced MRI datasets were assessed by two radiologists for qualitative and quantitative imaging features, including imaging features defined in LI-RADS v2018 and area of hepatobiliary phase (HBP) iso- to hyperintensity. The combination of non-rim arterial phase hyperenhancement with non-peripheral portal venous washout was more common in ""not otherwise specified"" (nos-ST) (88/168, 52%) than other subtypes, in particular macrotrabecular massive (mt-ST) (3/15, 20%), chromophobe (ch-ST) (1/8, 13%), and scirrhous subtypes (sc-ST) (2/9, 22%) (p = 0.035). Macrovascular invasion was associated with mt-ST (5/16, p = 0.033) and intralesional steatosis with steatohepatitic subtype (sh-ST) (28/32, p < 0.001). Predominant iso- to hyperintensity in the HBP was only present in nos-ST (16/174), sh-ST (3/33), and clear cell subtypes (cc-ST) (3/13) (p = 0.031). Associations were found for the following non-imaging parameters: age and sex, as patients with fibrolamellar subtype (fib-ST) were younger (median 44 years (19-66), p < 0.001) and female (4/5, p = 0.023); logarithm of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) was elevated in the mt-ST (median 397 µg/l (74-5370), p < 0.001); type II diabetes mellitus was more frequent in the sh-ST (20/33, p = 0.027). Gd-EOB-MRI reproduces findings reported in the literature for extracellular contrast-enhanced MRI and CT and may be a valuable tool for noninvasive HCC subtype differentiation. Better characterization of the heterogeneous phenotypes of HCC according to the revised WHO classification potentially improves both diagnostic accuracy and the precision of therapeutic stratification for HCC. • Previously reported imaging features of common subtypes in CT and MRI enhanced with extracellular contrast agents are reproducible with Gd-EOB-enhanced MRI. • While uncommon, predominant iso- to hyperintensity in the HBP was observed only in NOS, clear cell, and steatohepatitic subtypes. • Gd-EOB-enhanced MRI offers imaging features that are of value for HCC subtype differentiation according to the 5",2358
37115215,Diagnostic accuracy of state-of-the-art rectal MRI sequences for the diagnosis of extramural vascular invasion in locally advanced rectal cancer after preoperative chemoradiotherapy: dos or maybes?,European radiology,2023,"The aim of this study was to determine the accuracy of three state-of-the-art MRI sequences for the detection of extramural venous invasion (EMVI) in locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) patients after preoperative chemoradiotherapy (pCRT). This retrospective study included 103 patients (median age 66 years old [43-84]) surgically treated with pCRT for LARC and submitted to preoperative contrast-enhanced pelvic MRI after pCRT. T2-weighted, DWI, and contrast-enhanced sequences were evaluated by two radiologists with expertise in abdominal imaging, blinded to clinical and histopathological data. Patients were scored according to the probability of EMVI presence on each sequence using a grading score ranging from 0 (no evidence of EMVI) to 4 (strong evidence of EMVI). Results from 0 to 2 were ranked as EMVI negative and from 3 to 4 as EMVI positive. ROC curves were drawn for each technique, using histopathological results as reference standard. T2-weighted, DWI, and contrast-enhanced sequences demonstrated an area under the ROC curve (AUC) respectively of 0.610 (95% CI: 0.509-0.704), 0.729 (95% CI: 0.633-0.812), and 0.624 (95% CI: 0.523-0.718). The AUC of DWI sequence was significantly higher than that of T2-weighted (p = 0.0494) and contrast-enhanced (p = 0.0315) sequences. DWI is more accurate than T2-weighted and contrast-enhanced sequences for the identification of EMVI following pCRT in LARC patients. MRI protocol for restaging locally advanced rectal cancer after preoperative chemoradiotherapy should routinely include DWI due to its higher accuracy for the diagnosis of extramural venous invasion compared to high-resolution T2-weighted and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted sequences. • MRI has a moderately high accuracy for the diagnosis of extramural venous invasion in locally advanced rectal cancer after preoperative chemoradiotherapy. • DWI is more accurate than T2-weighted and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted sequences in the detection of extramural venous invasion after preoperative chemoradiotherapy of locally advanced rectal cancer. • DWI should be routinely included in the MRI protocol for restaging locally advanced rectal cancer after preoperative chemoradiotherapy.",2209
37104728,"Impact of Artificial Intelligence System and Volumetric Density on Risk Prediction of Interval, Screen-Detected, and Advanced Breast Cancer.",Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,2023,"Artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms improve breast cancer detection on mammography, but their contribution to long-term risk prediction for advanced and interval cancers is unknown. We identified 2,412 women with invasive breast cancer and 4,995 controls matched on age, race, and date of mammogram, from two US mammography cohorts, who had two-dimensional full-field digital mammograms performed 2-5.5 years before cancer diagnosis. We assessed Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System density, an AI malignancy score (1-10), and volumetric density measures. We used conditional logistic regression to estimate odds ratios (ORs), 95% CIs, adjusted for age and BMI, and C-statistics (AUC) to describe the association of AI score with invasive cancer and its contribution to models with breast density measures. Likelihood ratio tests (LRTs) and bootstrapping methods were used to compare model performance. On mammograms between 2-5.5 years prior to cancer, a one unit increase in AI score was associated with 20% greater odds of invasive breast cancer (OR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.17 to 1.22; AUC, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.62 to 0.64) and was similarly predictive of interval (OR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.13 to 1.27; AUC, 0.63) and advanced cancers (OR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.16 to 1.31; AUC, 0.64) and in dense (OR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.15 to 1.22; AUC, 0.66) breasts. AI score improved prediction of all cancer types in models with density measures ( AI imaging algorithms coupled with breast density independently contribute to long-term risk prediction of invasive breast cancers, in particular, advanced cancer.",1585
37103922,Longitudinal Analysis of Change in Mammographic Density in Each Breast and Its Association With Breast Cancer Risk.,JAMA oncology,2023,"Although breast density is an established risk factor for breast cancer, longitudinal changes in breast density have not been extensively studied to determine whether this factor is associated with breast cancer risk. To prospectively evaluate the association between change in mammographic density in each breast over time and risk of subsequent breast cancer. This nested case-control cohort study was sampled from the Joanne Knight Breast Health Cohort of 10 481 women free from cancer at entry and observed from November 3, 2008, to October 31, 2020, with routine screening mammograms every 1 to 2 years, providing a measure of breast density. Breast cancer screening was provided for a diverse population of women in the St Louis region. A total of 289 case patients with pathology-confirmed breast cancer were identified, and approximately 2 control participants were sampled for each case according to age at entry and year of enrollment, yielding 658 controls with a total number of 8710 craniocaudal-view mammograms for analysis. Exposures included screening mammograms with volumetric percentage of density, change in volumetric breast density over time, and breast biopsy pathology-confirmed cancer. Breast cancer risk factors were collected via questionnaire at enrollment. Longitudinal changes over time in each woman's volumetric breast density by case and control status. The mean (SD) age of the 947 participants was 56.67 (8.71) years at entry; 141 were Black (14.9%), 763 were White (80.6%), 20 were of other race or ethnicity (2.1%), and 23 did not report this information (2.4%). The mean (SD) interval was 2.0 (1.5) years from last mammogram to date of subsequent breast cancer diagnosis (10th percentile, 1.0 year; 90th percentile, 3.9 years). Breast density decreased over time in both cases and controls. However, there was a significantly slower decrease in rate of decline in density in the breast that developed breast cancer compared with the decline in controls (estimate = 0.027; 95% CI, 0.001-0.053; P = .04). This study found that the rate of change in breast density was associated with the risk of subsequent breast cancer. Incorporation of longitudinal changes into existing models could optimize risk stratification and guide more personalized risk management.",2296

Purpose To develop a radiomics approach for predicting MVI status based on preoperative multiphase CT images and to identify MVI-associated differentially expressed genes. Materials and Methods Patients with pathologically proven HCC from May 2012 to September 2020 were retrospectively included from four medical centers. Radiomics features were extracted from tumors and peritumor regions on preoperative registration or subtraction CT images. In the training set, these features were used to build five radiomics models via logistic regression after feature reduction. The models were tested using internal and external test sets against a pathologic reference standard to calculate area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). The optimal AUC radiomics model and clinical-radiologic characteristics were combined to build the hybrid model.

However, few studies have focused on the outcome of supplemental AB US in Asian women who have denser breasts than Western women. Purpose To evaluate the performance of supplemental AB US on mammography-based breast cancer screening in Asian women with dense breasts and those with nondense breasts. Materials and Methods A retrospective database search identified asymptomatic Korean women who underwent digital mammography (DM) and supplemental AB US screening for breast cancer between January 2018 and December 2019. We excluded women without sufficient follow-up, established final diagnosis, or histopathologic results. Performance measures of DM alone and AB US combined with DM (hereafter AB US plus DM) were compared. The primary outcome was cancer detection rate (CDR), and the secondary outcomes were sensitivity and specificity. Subgroup analyses were performed based on mammography density. Results From 2785 screening examinations in 2301 women (mean age, 52 years ± 9 [SD]), 28 cancers were diagnosed (26 screening-detected cancers, two interval cancers). When compared with DM alone, AB US plus DM resulted in a higher CDR of 9.3 per 1000 examinations (95% CI: 7.7, 10.3) versus 6.5 per 1000 examinations (95% CI: 5.2, 7.2; ",1353

37095360,Quantitative susceptibility mapping evaluation of glioma.,European radiology,2023,"To comprehensively evaluate the glioma using quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM). Forty-two patients (18 women; mean age, 45 years) with pathologically confirmed gliomas were retrospectively included. All the patients underwent conventional and advanced MRI examinations (QSM, DWI, MRS, etc.). Five patients underwent paired QSM (pre- and post-enhancement). Four Visually Accessible Rembrandt Image (VASARI) features and intratumoural susceptibility signal (ITSS) were observed. Three ROIs each were manually drawn separately in the tumour parenchyma with relatively high and low magnetic susceptibility. The association between the tumour's magnetic susceptibility and other MRI parameters was also analysed. Morphologically, gliomas with heterogeneous ITSS were more similar to high-grade gliomas (p = 0.006, AUC: 0.72, sensitivity: 70%, and specificity: 73%). Heterogeneous ITSS was significantly associated with tumour haemorrhage, necrosis, diffusion restriction, and avid enhancement but did not change between pre- and post-enhanced QSM. Quantitatively, tumour parenchyma magnetic susceptibility had limited value in grading gliomas and identifying IDH mutation status, whereas the relatively low magnetic susceptibility of the tumour parenchyma helped identify oligodendrogliomas in IDH mutated gliomas (AUC = 0.78) with high specificity (100%). The relatively high tumour magnetic susceptibility significantly increased after enhancement (p = 0.039). Additionally, we found that the magnetic susceptibility of the tumour parenchyma was significantly correlated with ADC (r = 0.61) and Cho/NAA (r = 0.40). QSM is a promising candidate for the comprehensive evaluation of gliomas, except for IDH mutation status. The magnetic susceptibility of tumour parenchyma may be affected by tumour cell proliferation. • Morphologically, gliomas with a heterogeneous intratumoural susceptibility signal (ITSS) are more similar to high-grade gliomas (p = 0.006; AUC, 0.72; sensitivity, 70%; and specificity, 73%).

Recently, enfortumab vedotin (EV) was approved by the FDA as the first nectin-4 targeting antibody-drug conjugate for treating advanced urothelial carcinoma (UC). A PET imaging method to noninvasively quantify nectin-4 expression level would potentially help to select patients most likely to respond to EV and predict the response. In this study, we designed a bicyclic peptide-based nectin-4 targeting radiotracer 68Ga-N188. Initially, we performed preclinical evaluations of 68Ga-N188 in UC cell lines and xenograft mouse models. Next, we performed the translational study in healthy volunteers and a pilot cohort of patients with advanced UC on uEXPLORER total-body PET/CT. In the preclinical study, 68Ga-N188 showed high affinity to nectin-4, specific uptake in a nectin-4(+) xenograft mouse model, and suitable pharmacokinetic and safety profiles. In the translational study, 2 healthy volunteers and 14 patients with advanced UC were enrolled. The pharmacokinetic profile was determined for 68Ga-N188, and the nectin-4 relative expression level in different organs was quantitatively imaged. A clear correlation between PET SUV value and nectin-4 expression was observed, supporting the application of 68Ga-N188 PET as a companion diagnostic tool for optimizing treatments that target nectin-4.

37086288,MRI prediction of neoadjuvant chemotherapy response is equivalent in patients with or without mammographic calcifications: a step towards adapting surgical approach?,European radiology,2023,"Current surgical policy recommends comprehensive excision of tumorous calcifications in breast cancer patients following neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) regardless of MRI outcomes, despite MRI defining tumor response superior to mammography. The current study examines MRI prediction of response in tumors with vs without calcifications, using post-NAC surgical pathology as the standard of reference. Retrospective analysis of 114 NAC patients between 2011 and 2018 including demographics, mammography, 3 T-MRI, and pathology compared two sub-groups: without (n = 62) or with (n = 52) mammographic calcifications. In the calcification cohort, the mammographic extent of calcifications and MRI enhancement overlapped. MRI prediction of response to NAC was correlated with pathology. Two-tailed paired T and Fisher's exact tests and Cohen's kappa coefficient were applied for analysis. There was no significant difference between the two sub-groups regarding demographics. Tumors demonstrated equivalent features regarding size, lymph node involvement, and DCIS component. ER-negative/HER2-positive tumors more commonly exhibited calcifications (33% n = 17 calcified vs 13% n = 8 non-calcified; p < 0.05); triple negative pathology rarely calcified (6% n = 3 calcified vs 33% n = 20 non-calcified; p < 0.05). NME was more common with calcifications (62% n = 32 calcified vs 29% n = 18 non-calcified; p < 0.05) and mass enhancement without (90% n = 56 non-calcified vs 81% n = 42 calcified; p < 0.05). Both groups responded similarly to NAC (pCR = 37% non-calcified vs 38% calcified); response on MRI equally correlated with pathology (69% both subgroups; p = 0.988). We propose utilizing post-NAC MRI findings rather than mammography in planning surgery, as MRI prediction is independent of the presence or absence of calcifications. Prospective studies to evaluate this approach are warranted. • No difference was found in demographic, clinical, pathology, or imaging characteristics between patients with or without tumoral calcifications on mammography prior to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. • Residual mammographic calcifications are inadequate predictors of residual invasive disease. MRI accurately recognized complete response and correctly correlated with post-treatment surgical pathology in 69% of patients, regardless of the presence or absence of mammographic calcifications. • We propose utilizing post-NAC MRI findings rather than mammography in planning post-NAC surgery, as MRI prediction of response is independent of the presence or absence of calcifications.",2571

MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central, and Scopus were searched until December 2021 for diagnostic accuracy studies comparing MRI vs. CT to evaluate vascular invasion of pathologically confirmed PDAC in the same patients. Findings on resection or exploratory laparotomy were the preferred reference standard. Data extraction, risk of bias, and applicability assessment were performed by two authors using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-Comparative Tool. Bivariate random-effects meta-analysis and meta-regression were performed with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). Three studies were included assessing 474 vessels without vascular invasion and 65 with vascular invasion in 107 patients. All patients were imaged using MRI at ≥ 1.5 T and a pancreatic protocol CT. No difference was shown between MRI and CT for diagnosing PDAC vascular invasion: MRI/CT sensitivity (95% CI) were 71% (47-87%)/74% (56-86%), and specificity were 97% (94-99%)/97% (94-98%). Sources of bias included selection bias from only a subset of CT patients undergoing MRI and verification bias from patients with unresectable disease not confirmed on surgery. No patients received neoadjuvant therapy prior to staging. Based on limited data, no difference was observed between MRI and pancreatic protocol CT for PDAC vascular invasion assessment. MRI may be an adequate substitute for pancreatic protocol CT in some patients, particularly those who have already had a single-phase CT. Larger and more recent cohort studies at low risk of bias, including patients who have received neoadjuvant therapy, are needed. Abdominal MRI performed similarly to pancreatic protocol CT at assessing pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma vascular invasion, suggesting local staging is adequate in some patients using MRI. More data are needed using larger, more recent cohorts including patients with neoadjuvant treatment. • Based on limited data, no difference was found between MRI and pancreatic protocol CT sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing PDAC vascular invasion (p = 0.81, 0.73 respectively). • Risk of bias could be reduced in future PDAC MRI vs CT comparative diagnostic test accuracy research by ensuring all enrolled patients undergo both imaging modalities being compared in random order and regardless of the findings on either modality. • More studies are needed that directly compare the diagnostic performance of MRI and CT for PDAC staging after neoadjuvant therapy.",2619

Initial search yielded 1112 articles; however, only 12 articles met all inclusion/exclusion criteria. Cohort sizes ranged from 37 to 352 (median = 106, mean = 155.8). CT slice thickness varied among studies (4 using ≤ 1 mm, 5 using > 1 to 3 mm, 2 using > 3 to 5 mm, 1 not specifying). CT protocol varied (5 using a single portal-venous (pv)-phase, 5 using a pancreas protocol, 1 study using a non-contrast protocol). RF extraction and segmentation were heterogeneous (RF extraction: 5 using pv-phase, 2 using late arterial, 4 using multi-phase, 1 using non-contrast phase; RF selection: 3 pre-selected, 9 software-selected). 2D/3D RF segmentation was diverse (2D in 6, 3D in 4, 2D and 3D in 2 studies). Six different radiomics software were used. Research questions and cohort characteristics varied, ultimately leading to non-comparable outcome results. The current twelve published IBSI-compliant PDAC radiomic studies show high variability and often incomplete methodology resulting in low robustness and reproducibility. Radiomics research requires IBSI compliance, data harmonisation, and reproducible feature extraction methods for non-invasive imaging biomarker discoveries to be valid. This will ensure a successful clinical implementation and ultimately an improvement of patient outcomes as part of precision and personalised medicine. • Current state of radiomics research in pancreatic cancer shows low software compliance to the Image Biomarker Standardisation Initiative (IBSI). • IBSI-compliant radiomics studies in pancreatic cancer are heterogeneous and not comparable, and the majority of study designs showed low reproducibility. • Improved methodology and standardisation of practice in the emerging field of radiomics has the potential of this non-invasive imaging biomarker in the management of pancreatic cancer.",2603
37074425,Predicting the recurrence risk of renal cell carcinoma after nephrectomy: potential role of CT-radiomics for adjuvant treatment decisions.,European radiology,2023,"Previous trial results suggest that only a small number of patients with non-metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) benefit from adjuvant therapy. We assessed whether the addition of CT-based radiomics to established clinico-pathological biomarkers improves recurrence risk prediction for adjuvant treatment decisions. This retrospective study included 453 patients with non-metastatic RCC undergoing nephrectomy. Cox models were trained to predict disease-free survival (DFS) using post-operative biomarkers (age, stage, tumor size and grade) with and without radiomics selected on pre-operative CT. Models were assessed using C-statistic, calibration, and decision curve analyses (repeated tenfold cross-validation). At multivariable analysis, one of four selected radiomic features (wavelet-HHL_glcm_ClusterShade) was prognostic for DFS with an adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 0.44 (p = 0.02), along with American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stage group (III versus I, HR 2.90; p = 0.002), grade 4 (versus grade 1, HR 8.90; p = 0.001), age (per 10 years HR 1.29; p = 0.03), and tumor size (per cm HR 1.13; p = 0.003). The discriminatory ability of the combined clinical-radiomic model (C = 0.80) was superior to that of the clinical model (C = 0.78; p < 0.001). Decision curve analysis revealed a net benefit of the combined model when used for adjuvant treatment decisions. At an exemplary threshold probability of ≥ 25% for disease recurrence within 5 years, using the combined versus the clinical model was equivalent to treating 9 additional patients (per 1000 assessed) who would recur without treatment (i.e., true-positive predictions) with no increase in false-positive predictions. Adding CT-based radiomic features to established prognostic biomarkers improved post-operative recurrence risk assessment in our internal validation study and may help guide decisions regarding adjuvant therapy. In patients with non-metastatic renal cell carcinoma undergoing nephrectomy, CT-based radiomics combined with established clinical and pathological biomarkers improved recurrence risk assessment. Compared to a clinical base model, the combined risk model enabled superior clinical utility if used to guide decisions on adjuvant treatment.",2246
37074424,Robustness of pulmonary nodule radiomic features on computed tomography as a function of varying radiation dose levels-a multi-dose in vivo patient study.,European radiology,2023,"Analysis of textural features of pulmonary nodules in chest CT, also known as radiomics, has several potential clinical applications, such as diagnosis, prognostication, and treatment response monitoring. For clinical use, it is essential that these features provide robust measurements. Studies with phantoms and simulated lower dose levels have demonstrated that radiomic features can vary with different radiation dose levels. This study presents an in vivo stability analysis of radiomic features for pulmonary nodules against varying radiation dose levels. Nineteen patients with a total of thirty-five pulmonary nodules underwent four chest CT scans at different radiation dose levels (60, 33, 24, and 15 mAs) in a single session. The nodules were manually delineated. To assess the robustness of features, we calculated the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC). To visualize the effect of milliampere-second variation on groups of features, a linear model was fitted to each feature. We calculated bias and calculated the R A small minority of 15/100 (15%) radiomic features were considered stable (ICC > 0.9). Bias increased and R A large majority of pulmonary nodule radiomic features were not inherently robust to radiation dose level variations. For a subset of features, it was possible to correct this variability by a simple linear model. However, the correction became increasingly less accurate at lower radiation dose levels. Radiomic features provide a quantitative description of a tumor based on medical imaging such as computed tomography (CT). These features are potentially useful in several clinical tasks such as diagnosis, prognosis prediction, treatment effect monitoring, and treatment effect estimation. • The vast majority of commonly used radiomic features are strongly influenced by variations in radiation dose level. • A small minority of radiomic features, notably the shape feature class, are robust against dose-level variations according to ICC calculations. • A large subset of radiomic features can be corrected by a linear model taking into account only the radiation dose level.",2125
37074423,Conventional ultrasound combined with contrast-enhanced ultrasound: could it be helpful for the diagnosis of thoracic wall recurrence after mastectomy?,European radiology,2023,"To develop a predictive model using conventional ultrasound combined with CEUS to identify thoracic wall recurrence after mastectomy. A total of 162 women with pathologically confirmed thoracic wall lesions (benign 79, malignant 83; median size 1.9 cm, ranging 0.3-8.0 cm) underwent a mastectomy and were checked by both conventional ultrasound and CEUS and were retrospectively included. Logistic regression models of B-mode ultrasound (US) and color Doppler flow imaging (CDFI) with or without CEUS were established to assess the thoracic wall recurrence after mastectomy. The established models were validated by bootstrap resampling. The models were evaluated using calibration curve. The clinical benefit of models were assessed using decision curve analysis. The area under the receiver characteristic was 0.823 (95% CI: 0.76, 0.88) for model using US alone, 0.898 (95% CI: 0.84, 0.94) for model using US combined with CDFI, and 0.959 (95% CI: 0.92, 0.98) for model using US combined with both CDFI and CEUS. The diagnostic performance of the US combined with CDFI was significantly higher than that of the US alone (0.823 vs 0.898, p = 0.002) but significantly lower than that of the US combined with both CDFI and CEUS (0.959 vs 0.898, p < 0.001). Moreover, the unnecessary biopsy rate of the US combined with both CDFI and CEUS was significantly lower than that of the US combined with CDFI (p = 0.037). Compared to B-mode ultrasound and CDFI, CEUS improves the diagnostic performance to evaluate thoracic wall recurrence after mastectomy. • CUES is an effective supplementary method for US in the diagnosis of thoracic wall recurrence after mastectomy. • CEUS combined with both US and CDFI can significantly improve the accuracy of diagnosis of thoracic wall recurrence after mastectomy. • CEUS combined with both US and CDFI can reduce the rate of unnecessary biopsy of thoracic wall lesions after mastectomy.",1921
37074422,"Effect of tumor genetics, pathology, and location on fMRI of language reorganization in brain tumor patients.",European radiology,2023,"Language reorganization may follow tumor invasion of the dominant hemisphere. Tumor location, grade, and genetics influence the communication between eloquent areas and tumor growth dynamics, which are drivers of language plasticity. We evaluated tumor-induced language reorganization studying the relationship of fMRI language laterality to tumor-related variables (grade, genetics, location), and patient-related variables (age, sex, handedness). The study was retrospective cross-sectional. We included patients with left-hemispheric tumors (study group) and right-hemispheric tumors (controls). We calculated five fMRI laterality indexes (LI): hemispheric, temporal lobe, frontal lobe, Broca's area (BA), Wernicke's area (WA). We defined LI ≥ 0.2 as left-lateralized (LL) and LI < 0.2 as atypical lateralized (AL). Chi-square test (p < 0.05) was employed to identify the relationship between LI and tumor/patient variables in the study group. For those variables having significant results, confounding factors were evaluated in a multinomial logistic regression model. We included 405 patients (235 M, mean age: 51 years old) and 49 controls (36 M, mean age: 51 years old). Contralateral language reorganization was more common in patients than controls. The statistical analysis demonstrated significant association between BA LI and patient sex (p = 0.005); frontal LI, BA LI, and tumor location in BA (p < 0.001); hemispheric LI and fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) mutation (p = 0.019); WA LI and O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase promoter (MGMT) methylation in high-grade gliomas (p = 0.016). Tumor genetics, pathology, and location influence language laterality, possibly due to cortical plasticity. Increased fMRI activation in the right hemisphere was seen in patients with tumors in the frontal lobe, BA and WA, FGFR mutation, and MGMT promoter methylation. • Patients harboring left-hemispheric tumors present with contralateral translocation of language function. Influential variables for this phenomenon included frontal tumor location, BA location, WA location, sex, MGMT promoter methylation, and FGFR mutation. • Tumor location, grade, and genetics may influence language plasticity, thereby affecting both communication between eloquent areas and tumor growth dynamics. • In this retrospective cross-sectional study, we evaluated language reorganization in 405 brain tumor patients by studying the relationship of fMRI language laterality to tumor-related variables (grade, genetics, location), and patient-related variables (age, sex, handedness).",2583

37071167,Semiautomated segmentation of hepatocellular carcinoma tumors with MRI using convolutional neural networks.,European radiology,2023,"To assess the performance of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for semiautomated segmentation of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tumors on MRI. This retrospective single-center study included 292 patients (237 M/55F, mean age 61 years) with pathologically confirmed HCC between 08/2015 and 06/2019 and who underwent MRI before surgery. The dataset was randomly divided into training (n = 195), validation (n = 66), and test sets (n = 31). Volumes of interest (VOIs) were manually placed on index lesions by 3 independent radiologists on different sequences (T2-weighted imaging [WI], T1WI pre-and post-contrast on arterial [AP], portal venous [PVP], delayed [DP, 3 min post-contrast] and hepatobiliary phases [HBP, when using gadoxetate], and diffusion-weighted imaging [DWI]). Manual segmentation was used as ground truth to train and validate a CNN-based pipeline. For semiautomated segmentation of tumors, we selected a random pixel inside the VOI, and the CNN provided two outputs: single slice and volumetric outputs. Segmentation performance and inter-observer agreement were analyzed using the 3D Dice similarity coefficient (DSC). A total of 261 HCCs were segmented on the training/validation sets, and 31 on the test set. The median lesion size was 3.0 cm (IQR 2.0-5.2 cm). Mean DSC (test set) varied depending on the MRI sequence with a range between 0.442 (ADC) and 0.778 (high b-value DWI) for single-slice segmentation; and between 0.305 (ADC) and 0.667 (T1WI pre) for volumetric-segmentation. Comparison between the two models showed better performance in single-slice segmentation, with statistical significance on T2WI, T1WI-PVP, DWI, and ADC. Inter-observer reproducibility of segmentation analysis showed a mean DSC of 0.71 in lesions between 1 and 2 cm, 0.85 in lesions between 2 and 5 cm, and 0.82 in lesions > 5 cm. CNN models have fair to good performance for semiautomated HCC segmentation, depending on the sequence and tumor size, with better performance for the single-slice approach. Refinement of volumetric approaches is needed in future studies. • Semiautomated single-slice and volumetric segmentation using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) models provided fair to good performance for hepatocellular carcinoma segmentation on MRI. • CNN models' performance for HCC segmentation accuracy depends on the MRI sequence and tumor size, with the best results on diffusion-weighted imaging and T1-weighted imaging pre-contrast, and for larger lesions.",2482

This work aims to shed light on the state of the art in radiomics, which offers numerous tangible and intangible benefits, and to encourage its integration in the contemporary clinical practice for more precise imaging analysis. • ML-based bibliometric analysis is fundamental to detect unknown pattern of data in Radiomics publications. • A raising interest in the field, the most relevant collaborations, keywords co-occurrence network, and trending topics have been investigated. • Some pitfalls still exist, including the scarce standardization and the relative lack of homogeneity across studies.",2339
37070991,A Prognostic Risk Score for Prostate Cancer Based on PSMA PET-derived Organ-specific Tumor Volumes.,Radiology,2023,"Background Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) PET has high specificity in localizing primary tumors and metastases in patients with prostate cancer, but the individual overall survival probability is still difficult to estimate. Purpose To develop a prognostic risk score using PSMA PET-derived organ-specific total tumor volumes for predicting overall survival in patients with prostate cancer. Materials and Methods Men with prostate cancer who underwent PSMA PET/CT from January 2014 to December 2018 were evaluated retrospectively. All patients from center A were split into training (80%) and internal validation (20%) cohorts. Randomly selected patients from center B were used for external validation. Organ-specific tumor volumes were automatically quantified from PSMA PET scans by a neural network. A prognostic score was selected using multivariable Cox regression guided by the Akaike information criterion (AIC). The final prognostic risk score fitted on the training set was applied to both validation cohorts. Results A total of 1348 men (mean age, 70 years ± 8 [SD]) were included, with 918 patients in the training cohort, 230 in the internal validation cohort, and 200 in the external validation cohort. The median follow-up time was 55.7 months (IQR, 46.7-65.1 months; >4 years; 429 deaths occurred). A body weight-adjusted prognostic risk score integrating total, bone, and visceral tumor volumes obtained high C index values in the internal (0.82) and external (0.74) validation cohorts, as well as in patients with castration-resistant (0.75) and hormone-sensitive (0.68) disease.

Data from 573 patients with histopathologically confirmed parotid tumors from center 1 (training set: n = 269; internal-testing set: n = 116) and center 2 (external-testing set: n = 188) were retrospectively collected. Six deep learning models (MobileNet V3, ShuffleNet V2, Inception V3, DenseNet 121, ResNet 50, and VGG 19) based on arterial-phase CT images, and a baseline support vector machine (SVM) model integrating clinical-radiological features with handcrafted radiomics signatures were constructed. The performance of senior and junior radiologists with and without optimal model assistance was compared. The net reclassification index (NRI) and integrated discrimination improvement (IDI) were calculated to evaluate the clinical benefit of using the optimal model. MobileNet V3 had the best predictive performance, with sensitivity increases of 0.111 and 0.207 (p < 0.05) in the internal- and external-testing sets, respectively, relative to the SVM model. Clinical benefit and overall efficiency of junior radiologist were significantly improved with model assistance; for the internal- and external-testing sets, respectively, the AUCs improved by 0.128 and 0.102 (p < 0.05), the sensitivity improved by 0.194 and 0.120 (p < 0.05), the NRIs were 0.257 and 0.205 (p < 0.001), and the IDIs were 0.316 and 0.252 (p < 0.001).

Oncology,2023,"Targeted real-time imaging during robot-assisted radical prostatectomy provides information on the localisation and extent of prostate cancer. We assessed the safety and feasibility of the prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-targeted fluorescent tracer OTL78 in patients with prostate cancer. In this single-arm, phase 2a, feasibility trial with an adaptive design was carried out in The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Netherlands. Male patients aged 18 years or older, with PSMA PET-avid prostate cancer with an International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) grade group of 2 or more, who were scheduled to undergo robot-assisted radical prostatectomy with or without extended pelvic lymph node dissection were eligible. All patients had a robot-assisted radical prostatectomy using OTL78. Based on timing and dose, patients received a single intravenous infusion of OTL78 (0·06 mg/kg 1-2 h before surgery [dose cohort 1], 0·03 mg/kg 1-2 h before surgery [dose cohort 2], or 0·03 mg/kg 24 h before surgery [dose cohort 3]).

Consecutive FDG PET/CT scans performed for the initial staging of NSCLC stage IB and IIA were retrospectively reviewed. The maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) of the primary tumor and mean SUV of the liver were acquired. The tumor-to-liver SUV ratio (TLR) was also calculated. Charts were reviewed for basic patient characteristics and high-risk factors for considering AT (poor differentiation, visceral pleura invasion, vascular invasion, tumors > 4 cm, and wedge resection). Statistical analysis was performed using Cox regression analysis and the Kaplan-Meier method. Of the 112 patients included, 15 (13.4%) died, with a median overall survival (OS) of 43.8 months. Twenty-two patients (19.6%) exhibited recurrence, with median disease-free survival (DFS) of 36.0 months. In univariable analysis, pathology, poor differentiation, and TLR were associated with shorter DFS and OS. In multivariable analysis, TLR (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.263, p = 0.008) and differentiation (HR = 3.087, p = 0.012) were associated with shorter DFS. Also, TLR (HR = 1.422, p < 0.001) was associated with shorter OS. TLR from FDG PET/CT was an independent prognostic factor for recurrence and survival. PET parameters constitute risk factors for consideration in the decision-making for AT in margin-negative stage IB and IIA NSCLC. In this study, TLR from FDG PET/CT was an independent prognostic factor in stage IB-IIA non-small cell cancer patients. Although additional validation studies are warranted, TLR has the potential to be used to determine the need for adjuvant therapy. • High TLR is an independent poor prognostic factor in stage IB-IIA NSCLC. • Adjuvant treatment should be considered in patients with high TLR following complete tumor resection.",1967
37060444,Multimodality radiomics analysis based on [,European radiology,2023,"To determine whether radiomics models developed from 2-deoxy-2-[ One hundred thirty-two NPC patients who underwent both PET/CT and MRI scanning were retrospectively enrolled (88 vs. 44 for training vs. testing). For each modality/sequence (i.e., PET, CT, T1, T1C, and T2), 1906 radiomics features were extracted from the primary tumor volume. Univariate Cox model and correlation analysis were used for feature selection. A multivariate Cox model was used to establish radiomics signature. Prognostic performances of 5 individual modality models and 12 multimodality models (3 integrations × 4 fusion strategies) were assessed by the concordance index (C-index) and log-rank test. A clinical-radiomics nomogram was built to explore the clinical utilities of radiomics signature, which was evaluated by discrimination, calibration curve, and decision curve analysis (DCA). The radiomics signatures of individual modalities showed limited prognostic efficacy with a C-index of 0.539-0.664 in the testing cohort. Different fusion strategies exhibited a slight difference in predictive performance. The PET/CT and MRI integrated model achieved the best performance with a C-index of 0.745 (95% CI, 0.619-0.865) in the testing cohort (log-rank test, p < 0.05). Clinical-radiomics nomogram further improved the prognosis, which also showed satisfactory discrimination, calibration, and net benefit. Multimodality radiomics analysis by combining PET/CT with multisequence MRI could potentially improve the efficacy of PFS prediction for NPC patients. • Individual modality radiomics models showed limited performance in prognosis evaluation for NPC patients. • Combined PET, CT and multisequence MRI radiomics signature could improve the prognostic efficacy. • Multilevel fusion strategies exhibit comparable performance but feature-level fusion deserves more attention.",1863

In total, 257 patients with pathologically confirmed meningiomas (162 low-grade, 95 high-grade) who underwent a preoperative brain MRI, including T2-weighted (T2) and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images (T1C), were included in the institutional training set. A two-stage DL grading model was constructed for segmentation and classification based on multiparametric three-dimensional U-net and ResNet. The models were validated in the external validation set consisting of 61 patients with meningiomas (46 low-grade, 15 high-grade). Relevance-weighted Class Activation Mapping (RCAM) method was used to interpret the DL features contributing to the prediction of the DL grading model. On external validation, the combined T1C and T2 model showed a Dice coefficient of 0.910 in segmentation and the highest performance for meningioma grading compared to the T2 or T1C only models, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.770 (95% confidence interval: 0.644-0.895) and accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 72.1%, 73.3%, and 71.7%, respectively.

Imaging findings were compared to subsequent interventional procedures and their complexity and outcome. BL was detected in Gd-EOB-DTPA-MRCP in 25 of patients and was subsequently confirmed. Sites of BL differed significantly between postoperative (central [58%] and peripheral [42%]) and trauma patients (intraparenchymal [100%]; p < 0.001). Aberrant or disconnected ducts were diagnosed in 8%/26% of cases in the postoperative subgroup. Inter-rater agreement for the detection and localization of BL was almost perfect (Κ = 0.85 and 0.88; p < 0.001). Intraparenchymal BL required significantly less complex interventional procedures (p = 0.002), whereas hospitalization and mortality did not differ between the subgroups (p > 0.05). Gd-EOB-DTPA-MRCP reliably detects and exactly locates BL in postoperative and trauma patients. Exact localization of biliary injuries enables specific treatment planning, as intraparenchymal leakages, which occur more frequently after trauma, require less complex interventions than central or peripheral leaks in the postoperative setting. As a result of specific treatment based on exact BL localization, there was no difference in the duration of hospitalization or mortality. Gd-EOB-DTPA-MRCP is a reliable diagnostic tool for exactly localizing iatrogenic and post-traumatic biliary leakage. Its precise localization helps tailor local therapies for different injury patterns, resulting in comparable clinical outcomes despite varying treatments. • Gd-EOB-DTPA-MRCP enables adequate detection and localization of bile leakages in both postoperative and post-traumatic patients. • The site of bile leakage significantly impacts the complexity of required additional interventions. • Intraparenchymal bile leakage is commonly seen in patients with a history of liver trauma and requires less complex interventions than postoperative central or peripheral bile leakages, while hospitalization and mortality are similar.",2636
37045982,Novel utility of Vesical Imaging-Reporting and Data System in multimodal treatment for muscle-invasive bladder cancer.,European radiology,2023,"To examine the clinical significance of the Vesical Imaging-Reporting and Data System (VI-RADS) in predicting outcome of multimodal treatment (MMT) in muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) patients. We reviewed 78 pathologically proven MIBC patients who underwent MMT including transurethral resection and chemoradiotherapy, followed by partial or radical cystectomy. Treatment response was assessed through histologic evaluation of cystectomy specimens. Two radiologists categorized the index lesions of pretherapeutic MRI according to the 5-point VI-RADS score. The associations of VI-RADS score with the therapeutic effect of MMT were analyzed. The diagnostic performance of VI-RADS scores with a cut-off VI-RADS scores  ≤ 2 or ≤ 3 for predicting pathologic complete response to MMT (MMT-CR) was evaluated. MMT-CR was achieved in 2 (100%) of VI-RADS score 1 (n = 2), 16 (84%) of score 2 (n = 19), 12 (86%) of score 3 (n = 14), 7 (64%) of score 4 (n = 11), and 14 (44%) of score 5 (n = 32). VI-RADS score was inversely associated with the incidence of MMT-CR (p = 0.00049). The cut-off VI-RADS score  ≤ 2 and  ≤ 3 could predict the favorable therapeutic outcome of MMT with high specificity (0.89 with 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.71-0.98 and 0.82 with 95% CI: 0.62-0.94, respectively) and high positive predictive value (0.86 with 95% CI: 0.64-0.97 and 0.86 with 95% CI: 0.70-0.95, respectively). VI-RADS score may serve as an imaging marker in MIBC patients for predicting the therapeutic outcome of MMT. Muscle-invasive bladder cancer patients with a lower Vesical Imaging-Reporting and Data System score can be a good candidate for bladder-sparing treatment incorporating multimodal treatment. • Vesical Imaging-Reporting and Data System (VI-RADS) score was potentially valuable for classifying pathologic tumor response in patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer. • The likelihood of achieving complete response of multimodal treatment (MMT) decreased with increasing VI-RADS score. • VI-RADS score could serve as an imaging marker that optimizes patient selection for MMT.",2088
37045981,Low cancer yield in PI-RADS 3 upgraded to 4 by dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI: is it time to reconsider scoring categorization?,European radiology,2023,"To evaluate MRI diagnostic performance in detecting clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa) in peripheral-zone PI-RADS 4 lesions, comparing those with clearly restricted diffusion (DWI-score 4), and those with equivocal diffusion pattern (DWI-score 3) and positive dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI. This observational prospective study enrolled 389 men referred to MRI and, if positive (PI-RADS 3 with PSA-density [PSAD] ≥ 0.15 ng/mL/mL, 4 and 5), to MRI-directed biopsy. Lesions with DWI-score 3 and positive DCE were classified as ""PI-RADS 3up,"" instead of PI-RADS 4. Univariable and multivariable analyses were implemented to determine features correlated to csPCa detection. Prevalence of csPCa was 14.5% and 53.3% in PI-RADS categories 3up and 4, respectively (p < 0.001). MRI showed a sensitivity of 100.0%, specificity 40.9%, PPV 46.5%, NPV 100.0%, and accuracy 60.9% for csPCa detection. Modifying the threshold to consider MRI positive and to indicate biopsy (same as previously described, but PI-RADS 3up only when associated with elevated PSAD), the sensitivity changed to 93.9%, specificity 57.2%, PPV 53.0%, NPV 94.8%, and accuracy 69.7%. Age (p < 0.001), PSAD (p < 0.001), positive DWI (p < 0.001), and PI-RADS score (p = 0.04) resulted in independent predictors of csPCa. Most cases of PI-RADS 3up were false-positives, suggesting that upgrading peripheral lesions with DWI-score 3 to PI-RADS 4 because of positive DCE has a detrimental effect on MRI accuracy, decreasing the true prevalence of csPCa in the PI-RADS 4 category. PI-RADS 3up should not be upgraded and directed to biopsy only if associated with increased PSAD. • As per PI-RADS v2.1 recommendations, in case of a peripheral zone lesion with equivocal diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI score 3), but positive dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI, the overall PI-RADS score should be upgraded to 4. • The current PI-RADS recommendation of upgrading PI-RADS 3 lesions of the peripheral zone to PI-RADS 4 because of positive DCE decreased clinically significant prostate cancer detection rate in our series. • According to our results, the most accurate threshold for setting indication to prostate biopsy is PI-RADS 3 or PI-RADS 3 with positive DCE both associated with increased PSA density.",2276

Consecutive biopsies performed at two community-based breast centers from 2016 to 2019 were retrospectively reviewed. Technical details of each procedure and patient outcomes were recorded. Separate analyses were performed for ultrasound-occult ADs. Two sample t-tests and Fisher's exact test facilitated comparisons. A total of 1133 patients underwent 369 prone DM-VABB, 324 prone DBT-VABB, 437 upright DM-VABB, and 123 upright DBT-VABB with 99.2%, 100%, 99.3%, and 99.2% success, respectively (p-values > 0.25). Mean lesion targeting times were greater for prone biopsy (minutes: 6.94 prone DM-VABB, 8.54 prone DBT-VABB, 5.52 upright DM-VABB, and 5.51 upright DBT-VABB; p-values < 0.001), yielding longer total prone procedure times for prone biopsy (p < 0.001). Compared to DM-VABB, DBT-VABB used fewer exposures (p < 0.001) and more commonly targeted AD, asymmetries, or masses (p < 0.001). Malignancy rates were similar between procedures: prone DM-VABB 22.4%, prone DBT-VABB 21.9%, upright DM-VABB 22.8%, and upright DBT-VABB 17.2% (p-values > 0.19). One hundred forty of the 1133 patients underwent 145 biopsies for ultrasound-occult AD (143 DBT-VABB and 2 DM-VABB). Biopsy yielded 27 malignancies and 47 high-risk lesions (74 of 145, 51%). Malignancy rate was 20.7% after surgical upgrade of one benign-discordant and two high-risk lesions. All biopsy procedure types were extremely successful. The 20.7% malignancy rate for ultrasound-occult AD confirms a management recommendation for tissue diagnosis. Upright biopsy was faster than prone biopsy, and DBT-VABB used fewer exposures than DM-VABB. Our results highlight important differences between prone DM-VABB, prone DBT-VABB, upright DM-VABB, and upright DBT-VABB. Moreover, the high likelihood of malignancy for ultrasound-occult AD will provide confidence in recommending tissue diagnosis in lieu of observation or clinical follow-up. • Upright and prone stereotactic and tomosynthesis-guided breast biopsies were safe and effective in the community-practice setting. • The malignancy rate for ultrasound-occult architectural distortion of 20.7% confirms the management recommendation for biopsy. • Upright procedures were faster than prone procedures, and tomosynthesis-guided biopsy used fewer exposures than stereotactic biopsy.",2570

We investigate whether data mined line annotations can facilitate brain MRI tumor segmentation model development without requiring manually segmented training data. In this retrospective study, a tumor detection model trained using clinical line annotations mined from PACS was leveraged with unsupervised segmentation to generate pseudo-masks of enhancing tumors on T1-weighted post-contrast images (9911 image slices; 3449 adult patients). Baseline segmentation models were trained and employed within a semi-supervised learning (SSL) framework to refine the pseudo-masks. Following each self-refinement cycle, a new model was trained and tested on a held-out set of 319 manually segmented image slices (93 adult patients), with the SSL cycles continuing until Dice score coefficient (DSC) peaked. DSCs were compared using bootstrap resampling. Utilizing the best-performing models, two inference methods were compared: (1) conventional full-image segmentation, and (2) a hybrid method augmenting full-image segmentation with detection plus image patch segmentation. Baseline segmentation models achieved DSC of 0.768 (U-Net), 0.831 (Mask R-CNN), and 0.838 (HRNet), improving with self-refinement to 0.798, 0.871, and 0.873 (each p < 0.001), respectively. Hybrid inference outperformed full image segmentation alone: DSC 0.884 (Mask R-CNN) vs. 0.873 (HRNet), p < 0.001. Line annotations mined from PACS can be harnessed within an automated pipeline to produce accurate brain MRI tumor segmentation models without manually segmented training data, providing a mechanism to rapidly establish tumor segmentation capabilities across radiology modalities. • A brain MRI tumor detection model trained using clinical line measurement annotations mined from PACS was leveraged to automatically generate tumor segmentation pseudo-masks. • An iterative self-refinement process automatically improved pseudo-mask quality, with the best-performing segmentation pipeline achieving a Dice score of 0.884 on a held-out test set. • Tumor line measurement annotations generated in routine clinical radiology practice can be harnessed to develop high-performing segmentation models without manually segmented training data, providing a mechanism to rapidly establish tumor segmentation capabilities across radiology modalities.",2476
37039688,Interactive Explainable Deep Learning Model Informs Prostate Cancer Diagnosis at MRI.,Radiology,2023,"Background Clinically significant prostate cancer (PCa) diagnosis at MRI requires accurate and efficient radiologic interpretation.

37036480,Structural plasticity of the contralesional hippocampus and its subfields in patients with glioma.,European radiology,2023,"To characterize the structural plasticity of the contralesional hippocampus and its subfields in patients with unilateral glioma. 3D T1-weighted MRI images were collected from 55 patients with tumors infiltrating the left (HipL, n = 27) or right (HipR, n = 28) hippocampus, along with 30 age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HC). Gray matter volume differences of the contralesional hippocampal regions and three control regions (superior frontal gyrus, caudate nucleus, and superior occipital gyrus) were evaluated using voxel-based morphometry (VBM) analyses. Volumetric differences in the hippocampus and its subregional volume were measured using the FreeSurfer software. Compared with HC, patients with unilateral hippocampal glioma exhibited significantly larger gray matter volume in the contralesional hippocampus and parahippocampal regions (cluster = 571 voxels for HipL; cluster 1 = 538 voxels and cluster 2 = 88 voxels for HipR; family-wise error corrected p < 0.05). No significant alterations were found in control regions. Volumetric analyses showed the same trend in the contralesional hippocampal subregions for both patient groups, including the CA1 head, CA3 head, hippocampus amygdala transition area (HATA), fimbria, and the granule cell molecular layer of the dentate gyrus head (GC-ML-DG head). Notably, the differences of the contralesional HATA (HipL: η Our findings provide evidence for macrostructural plasticity of the contralateral hippocampus in patients with unilateral hippocampal glioma.

37036478,Histogram analysis of quantitative parameters from synthetic MRI: correlations with prognostic factors in nasopharyngeal carcinoma.,European radiology,2023,"To evaluate the correlation between histogram parameters derived from synthetic magnetic resonance imaging (SyMRI) and prognostically relevant factors in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Fifty-nine consecutive NPC patients were prospectively enrolled. Quantitative parameters (T1, T2, and proton density (PD)) were obtained by outlining the three-dimensional volume of interest (VOI) of all lesions. Then, histogram analysis of these quantitative parameters was performed and the correlations with prognostically relevant factors were assessed. By choosing appropriate cutoff, we divided the sample into two groups. Independent-samples t test/Mann-Whitney U test was used and ROC curve analysis was further processed. Histogram parameters of the T1, T2, and PD maps were positively correlated with the Ki-67 expression levels, and PD_mean was the most representative parameter (AUC: 0.861). The PD map exhibited good performance in differentiating epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression levels (AUC: 0.706~0.732) and histological type (AUC: 0.650~0.660). T2_minimum was highest correlated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA levels (r =  - 0.419), and PD_75th percentile exhibited the highest performance in distinguishing positive and negative EBV DNA groups (AUC: 0.721). T1_minimum was statistically correlated with EA-IgA expression (r =  - 0.313). Additionally, several histogram parameters were negatively correlated with tumor stage (T stage: r =  - 0.259 ~ - 0.301; N stage: r =  - 0.348 ~  - 0.456; clinical stage: r =  - 0.419).

37020070,Imaging findings for response evaluation of ductal carcinoma in situ in breast cancer patients treated with neoadjuvant systemic therapy: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,European radiology,2023,"In approximately 45% of invasive breast cancer (IBC) patients treated with neoadjuvant systemic therapy (NST), ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is present. Recent studies suggest response of DCIS to NST. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to summarise and examine the current literature on imaging findings for different imaging modalities evaluating DCIS response to NST. More specifically, imaging findings of DCIS pre- and post-NST, and the effect of different pathological complete response (pCR) definitions, will be evaluated on mammography, breast MRI, and contrast-enhanced mammography (CEM). PubMed and Embase databases were searched for studies investigating NST response of IBC, including information on DCIS. Imaging findings and response evaluation of DCIS were assessed for mammography, breast MRI, and CEM. A meta-analysis was conducted per imaging modality to calculate pooled sensitivity and specificity for detecting residual disease between pCR definition no residual invasive disease (ypT0/is) and no residual invasive or in situ disease (ypT0). Thirty-one studies were included. Calcifications on mammography are related to DCIS, but can persist despite complete response of DCIS. In 20 breast MRI studies, an average of 57% of residual DCIS showed enhancement. A meta-analysis of 17 breast MRI studies confirmed higher pooled sensitivity (0.86 versus 0.82) and lower pooled specificity (0.61 versus 0.68) for detection of residual disease when DCIS is considered pCR (ypT0/is). Three CEM studies suggest the potential benefit of simultaneous evaluation of calcifications and enhancement. Calcifications on mammography can remain despite complete response of DCIS, and residual DCIS does not always show enhancement on breast MRI and CEM. Moreover, pCR definition effects diagnostic performance of breast MRI. Given the lack of evidence on imaging findings of response of the DCIS component to NST, further research is demanded. • Ductal carcinoma in situ has shown to be responsive to neoadjuvant systemic therapy, but imaging studies mainly focus on response of the invasive tumour. • The 31 included studies demonstrate that after neoadjuvant systemic therapy, calcifications on mammography can remain despite complete response of DCIS and residual DCIS does not always show enhancement on MRI and contrast-enhanced mammography. • The definition of pCR has impact on the diagnostic performance of MRI in detecting residual disease, and when DCIS is considered pCR, pooled sensitivity was slightly higher and pooled specificity slightly lower.",2586

This study aims at presenting and preliminarily validating a diffusion MRI (DWI)-based TCV quantification method and providing evidence of DWI potential in characterising non-cystic tissue microstructure. T2-weighted MRI and DWI scans (b = 0, 15, 50, 100, 200, 350, 500, 700, 1000; 3 directions) were acquired from 35 ADPKD patients with CKD stage 1 to 3a and 15 healthy volunteers on a 1.5 T scanner. ADPKD classification was performed using the Mayo model. DWI scans were processed by mono- and segmented bi-exponential models. TCV was quantified on T2-weighted MRI by the reference semi-automatic method and automatically computed by thresholding the pure diffusivity (D) histogram. The agreement between reference and DWI-based TCV values and the differences in DWI-based parameters between healthy and ADPKD tissue components were assessed. There was strong correlation between DWI-based and reference TCV (rho = 0.994, p < 0.001). Non-cystic ADPKD tissue had significantly higher D, and lower pseudo-diffusion and flowing fraction than healthy tissue (p < 0.001). Moreover, apparent diffusion coefficient and D values significantly differed by Mayo imaging class, both in the whole kidney (Wilcoxon p = 0.007 and p = 0.004) and non-cystic tissue (p = 0.024 and p = 0.007). DWI shows potential in ADPKD to quantify TCV and characterise non-cystic kidney tissue microstructure, indicating the presence of microcysts and peritubular interstitial fibrosis. DWI could complement existing biomarkers for non-invasively staging, monitoring, and predicting ADPKD progression and evaluating the impact of novel therapies, possibly targeting damaged non-cystic tissue besides cyst expansion.

Pre-menopausal women aged 40-50 years old were scanned at 3 T, employing a standard breast protocol including a DCE-MRI (35 and 30 participants in high- and low-risk groups, respectively). The dynamic range of the DCE protocol was characterised and both breasts were masked and segmented with minimal user input to produce measurements of fibro-glandular tissue volume, MRBD, and voxelwise BPE. Statistical tests were performed to determine inter- and intra-user repeatability, evaluate the symmetry between metrics derived from left and right breasts, and investigate MRBD and BPE differences between the high- and low-risk cohorts. Intra- and inter-user reproducibility in estimates of fibro-glandular tissue volume, MRBD, and median BPE estimations were good, with coefficients of variation < 15%. Coefficients of variation between left and right breasts were also low (< 25%). There were no significant correlations between fibro-glandular tissue volume, MRBD, and BPE for either risk group. However, the high-risk group had higher BPE kurtosis, although linear regression analysis did not reveal significant associations between BPE kurtosis and breast cancer risk. This study found no significant differences or correlations in fibro-glandular tissue volume, MRBD, or BPE metrics between the two groups of women with different levels of breast cancer risk. However, the results support further investigation into the heterogeneity of parenchymal enhancement. • A semi-automated method enabled quantitative measurements of fibro-glandular tissue volume, breast density, and background parenchymal enhancement with minimal user intervention. • Background parenchymal enhancement was quantified over the entire parenchyma, segmented in pre-contrast images, thus avoiding region selection. • No significant differences and correlations in fibro-glandular tissue volume, breast density, and breast background parenchymal enhancement were found between two cohorts of women at high and low levels of breast cancer risk.",2284

Patients who underwent preoperative gadoxetate disodium-enhanced MRI for focal solid nodules < 2.0 cm within 1 month of MRI between January 2016 and December 2020 were retrospectively analyzed. Major and ancillary features were compared between HCCs of < 1.0 cm and 1.0-1.9 cm using the chi-square test. Significant ancillary features associated with HCC < 1.0 cm were determined by univariable and multivariable logistic regression analysis. The sensitivity and specificity of LR-5 were compared between LI-RADS v2018 and our modified LI-RADS (applying the significant ancillary feature) using generalized estimating equations. Of 796 included nodules, 248 were < 1.0 cm and 548 were 1.0-1.9 cm. HCC < 1.0 cm less frequently showed an enhancing capsule (7.1% vs. 31.1%, p < .001) and threshold growth (0% vs. 8.3%, p = .007) than HCC of 1.0-1.9 cm. Restricted diffusion was the only ancillary feature significant for diagnosing HCC < 1.0 cm (adjusted odds ratio = 11.50, p < .001). In the diagnosis of HCC, our modified LI-RADS using restricted diffusion had significantly higher sensitivity than LI-RADS v2018 (61.8% vs. 53.5%, p < .001), with similar specificity (97.3% vs. 97.8%, p = .157). Restricted diffusion was the only significant independent ancillary feature for diagnosing HCC < 1.0 cm. Our modified LI-RADS using restricted diffusion can improve the sensitivity for HCC < 1.0 cm. • The imaging features of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) < 1.0 cm differed from those of HCC of 1.0-1.9 cm. • Restricted diffusion was the only significant independent ancillary feature for HCC < 1.0 cm. • Modified Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System (LI-RADS) with the addition of restricted diffusion can improve the sensitivity for HCC < 1.0 cm.",2011
37014407,Prognostic value of LI-RADS category on MRI in patients with primary hepatic lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma.,European radiology,2023,"To compare the clinical and MRI features of primary hepatic lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma (LELC) categorized as LR-M or LR-4/5 using the Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System (LI-RADS) version 2018 and to determine the prognostic factors for recurrence-free survival (RFS). In this retrospective study, 37 patients with surgically confirmed LELC were included. Two independent observers evaluated preoperative MRI features according to the LI-RADS version 2018. Clinical and imaging features were compared between two groups. RFS and the associated factors were evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression analysis, Kaplan-Meier analysis, and log-rank test. In total, 37 patients (mean age, 58.5 ± 10.3 years) were evaluated. Sixteen (43.2%) LELCs were categorized as LR-M and twenty-one (56.8%) LELCs were categorized as LR-4/5. In the multivariate analysis, the LR-M category was an independent factor for RFS (HR 7.908, 95% CI 1.170-53.437; p = 0.033). RFS rates were significantly lower in patients with LR-M LELCs than in patients with LR-4/5 LELCs (5-year RFS rate, 43.8% vs.85.7%; p = 0.002). The LI-RADS category was significantly associated with postsurgical prognosis of LELC, with tumor categorized as LR-M having a worse RFS than those categorized as LR-4/5. • Lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma patients categorized as LR-M have worse recurrence-free survival than those categorized as LR-4/5. • MRI-based LI-RADS categorization was an independent factor for postoperative prognosis of primary hepatic lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma.",1559
37014244,Imaging to Predict Prognosis in Hepatocellular Carcinoma: Current and Future Perspectives.,Radiology,2023,"The focus of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) research for many years has been on noninvasive diagnosis. Standardized systematic algorithms composed of combinations of precise features now serve as diagnostic imaging markers of HCC and constitute a major innovation for liver imaging. In clinical practice, the diagnosis of HCC is based primarily on imaging and secondarily on pathologic analysis if the imaging features are not specific. Whereas accurate diagnosis is essential, the next phase of innovation for HCC will likely encompass predictive and prognostic markers. HCC is a biologically heterogeneous malignancy because of complex molecular, pathologic, and patient-level factors that impact the outcomes of treatment. In recent years, there have been many advances in systemic therapy to augment and extend the existing large cache of local and regional options. However, the guideposts for treatment decisions are neither sophisticated nor individualized. This review provides an overview of prognosis in HCC from the patient to the imaging feature level with a focus on future directions toward more individualized treatment guidance.",1144
37014242,Contrast-enhanced US with Perfluorobutane to Diagnose Small Lateral Cervical Lymph Node Metastases of Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma.,Radiology,2023,"Background Although metastasis of lateral cervical lymph nodes (LNs) is common in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), correctly diagnosing small metastatic LNs with US remains challenging. The use of contrast-enhanced US (CEUS), especially the postvascular phase of CEUS with perfluorobutane contrast material, might contribute to improved diagnosis of metastatic LNs in PTC. Purpose To assess the diagnostic value of the postvascular phase of CEUS with perfluorobutane in suspicious small lateral cervical LNs (short-axis diameter ≤8 mm) in patients with PTC. Materials and Methods This single-center study prospectively enrolled consecutive participants with confirmed PTC and suspicious LNs at US from October 2020 to October 2021. All participants underwent CEUS, 1 week before biopsy or surgery, with intravenous perfluorobutane contrast material to visualize the LNs in the vascular phase (5-60 seconds after injection) and postvascular phase (10-30 minutes after injection). The reference standard was cytologic and surgical histologic assessment of the LNs. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy of sonographic features were calculated, and the diagnostic performance of US, CEUS, and the combination of postvascular phase and US features was assessed using multivariable logistic regression models. Results A total of 135 participants (median age, 36 years [IQR, 30-46 years]; 100 women) with 161 suspicious LNs at US were evaluated, including 67 metastatic and 94 benign LNs. The specificity of perfusion defect as a sonographic feature in the vascular phase reached 96% (90 of 94 LNs), and the negative predictive value of non-isoenhancement (ie, hypoenhancement, partial enhancement, and no enhancement) in the postvascular phase reached 100% (83 of 83 LNs). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of the combination of postvascular phase and US features was 0.94 (95% CI: 0.89, 0.97), significantly higher than that of US features alone (AUC, 0.73; 95% CI: 0.65, 0.79; ",2066
37014237,US and Digital Breast Tomosynthesis in Women with Focal Breast Complaints: Results of the Breast US Trial (BUST).,Radiology,2023,"Background Digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) followed by targeted US is commonly performed to evaluate women with localized breast complaints. However, the added value of DBT in addition to targeted US is unknown. Omitting DBT may be cost-effective and improve patient comfort but may miss potential breast cancer. Purpose To assess whether an imaging protocol consisting of targeted US alone may be feasible for the diagnostic work-up of women with localized symptoms and to assess the supplemental value of DBT in this reversed setting. Materials and Methods This prospective study enrolled consecutive women aged 30 years or older with focal breast complaints in three hospitals in the Netherlands between September 2017 and June 2019. In all participants, first, targeted US was evaluated, and if needed, biopsy was performed, followed by DBT. The primary outcome was the frequency of breast cancer detected with DBT when US was negative. Secondary outcomes were frequency of cancer detected with DBT elsewhere in the breast and combined overall sensitivity of US plus DBT. The reference standard was 1 year follow-up or histopathologic examination. Results There were 1961 women (mean age ± SD, 47 years ± 12) enrolled. Based on initial US alone, 1587 participants (81%) had normal or benign findings and 1759 (90%) had a definitive accurate diagnosis. In total, 204 breast cancers were detected during initial work-up. The frequency of malignancy was 10% (192 of 1961 participants) with US (US sensitivity, 98.5% [95% CI: 96, 100]; US specificity, 90.8% [95% CI: 89, 92]). DBT depicted three unobserved malignant lesions at the complaint site and 0.41% (eight of 1961 participants) of incidental malignant findings in participants without symptomatic cancer. Conclusion Compared with combined US and DBT, US was accurate as a stand-alone breast imaging modality in the assessment of focal breast complaints. The rate of cancer detection of cancers elsewhere in the breast with DBT is comparable to cancer detection rate of screening mammography. © RSNA, 2023 ",2066
37004569,Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) regional nodal disease at standard lymphadenectomy: is MRI accurate for identifying node-positive patients?,European radiology,2023,"To determine the accuracy of qualitative and quantitative MRI features for the diagnosis of pathologic regional lymph nodes at standard lymphadenectomy in patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). All adult patients with pancreatic MRI performed from 2011 to 2021 within 3 months of a pancreaticoduodenectomy were eligible for inclusion in this single-center retrospective cohort study. Regional nodes at standard lymphadenectomy were independently reviewed by two fellowship-trained abdominal radiologists for the following qualitative features: heterogeneous T2 signal, round shape, indistinct margin, peri-nodal fat stranding, and restricted diffusion greater than the spleen. Quantitative characteristics including primary tumor size, largest node short- and long-axes length, number of regional nodes, absolute apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values, and ADC node-to-spleen signal index were assessed. Analysis was at the patient-level with surgical pathology as the reference standard. Of 75 patients, 85% (64/75) were positive for regional nodal disease on histopathology. None of the qualitative variables evaluated on MRI was associated with pathologic nodes. Median primary tumor maximum diameter was slightly larger for patients with pathologic nodes compared to those without (18 mm (10-42 mm) vs 16 mm (9-22 mm), p = 0.027). None of the other quantitative features was associated with pathologic nodes. Radiologist opinion was not associated with pathologic nodes (p = 0.520). Interobserver agreement was fair (kappa = 0.257). Lymph node morphologic features and radiologist opinion using MRI are of limited value for diagnosing PDAC regional nodal disease. Improved diagnostic techniques are needed given the prognostic implications of pathologic lymph nodes in these patients. • Multiple lymph node morphologic features routinely assessed on MRI for malignancies elsewhere in the body are likely not applicable when assessing for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma nodal disease. • Interobserver agreement for the presence or absence of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma lymph node morphologic features on MRI is fair (kappa = 0.257). • Many more lymph nodes are resected at PDAC standard lymphadenectomy than are detectable on MRI, median 25 vs 5 (p < 0.001), suggesting improved diagnostic techniques are needed to identify PDAC nodal disease.",2375

However, we still lack high-level evidence in many areas relevant to making management decisions in daily clinical practise. The 2022 Advanced Prostate Cancer Consensus Conference (APCCC 2022) addressed some questions in these areas to supplement guidelines that mostly are based on level 1 evidence. To present the voting results of the APCCC 2022. The experts voted on controversial questions where high-level evidence is mostly lacking: locally advanced prostate cancer; biochemical recurrence after local treatment; metastatic hormone-sensitive, non-metastatic, and metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer; oligometastatic prostate cancer; and managing side effects of hormonal therapy. A panel of 105 international prostate cancer experts voted on the consensus questions. The panel voted on 198 pre-defined questions, which were developed by 117 voting and non-voting panel members prior to the conference following a modified Delphi process. A total of 116 questions on metastatic and/or castration-resistant prostate cancer are discussed in this manuscript. In 2022, the voting was done by a web-based survey because of COVID-19 restrictions. The voting reflects the expert opinion of these panellists and did not incorporate a standard literature review or formal meta-analysis. The answer options for the consensus questions received varying degrees of support from panellists, as reflected in this article and the detailed voting results are reported in the supplementary material. We report here on topics in metastatic, hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC), non-metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer (nmCRPC), metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), and oligometastatic and oligoprogressive prostate cancer. These voting results in four specific areas from a panel of experts in advanced prostate cancer can help clinicians and patients navigate controversial areas of management for which high-level evidence is scant or conflicting and can help research funders and policy makers identify information gaps and consider what areas to explore further. However, diagnostic and treatment decisions always have to be individualised based on patient characteristics, including the extent and location of disease, prior treatment(s), co-morbidities, patient preferences, and treatment recommendations and should also incorporate current and emerging clinical evidence and logistic and economic factors. Enrolment in clinical trials is strongly encouraged. Importantly, APCCC 2022 once again identified important gaps where there is non-consensus and that merit evaluation in specifically designed trials. The Advanced Prostate Cancer Consensus Conference (APCCC) provides a forum to discuss and debate current diagnostic and treatment options for patients with advanced prostate cancer. The conference aims to share the knowledge of international experts in prostate cancer with healthcare providers worldwide. At each APCCC, an expert panel votes on pre-defined questions that target the most clinically relevant areas of advanced prostate cancer treatment for which there are gaps in knowledge. The results of the voting provide a practical guide to help clinicians discuss therapeutic options with patients and their relatives as part of shared and multidisciplinary decision-making. This report focuses on the advanced setting, covering metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer and both non-metastatic and metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. Report of the results of APCCC 2022 for the following topics: mHSPC, nmCRPC, mCRPC, and oligometastatic prostate cancer. At APCCC 2022, clinically important questions in the management of advanced prostate cancer management were identified and discussed, and experts voted on pre-defined consensus questions.

36996627,CT radiomics compared to a clinical model for predicting checkpoint inhibitor treatment outcomes in patients with advanced melanoma.,"European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",2023,"Predicting checkpoint inhibitors treatment outcomes in melanoma is a relevant task, due to the unpredictable and potentially fatal toxicity and high costs for society. However, accurate biomarkers for treatment outcomes are lacking. Radiomics are a technique to quantitatively capture tumour characteristics on readily available computed tomography (CT) imaging. The purpose of this study was to investigate the added value of radiomics for predicting clinical benefit from checkpoint inhibitors in melanoma in a large, multicenter cohort. Patients who received first-line anti-PD1±anti-CTLA4 treatment for advanced cutaneous melanoma were retrospectively identified from nine participating hospitals. For every patient, up to five representative lesions were segmented on baseline CT, and radiomics features were extracted. A machine learning pipeline was trained on the radiomics features to predict clinical benefit, defined as stable disease for more than 6 months or response per RECIST 1.1 criteria. This approach was evaluated using a leave-one-centre-out cross validation and compared to a model based on previously discovered clinical predictors. Lastly, a combination model was built on the radiomics and clinical model. A total of 620 patients were included, of which 59.2% experienced clinical benefit. The radiomics model achieved an area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.607 [95% CI, 0.562-0.652], lower than that of the clinical model (AUROC=0.646 [95% CI, 0.600-0.692]). The combination model yielded no improvement over the clinical model in terms of discrimination (AUROC=0.636 [95% CI, 0.592-0.680]) or calibration. The output of the radiomics model was significantly correlated with three out of five input variables of the clinical model (p < 0.001). The radiomics model achieved a moderate predictive value of clinical benefit, which was statistically significant. However, a radiomics approach was unable to add value to a simpler clinical model, most likely due to the overlap in predictive information learned by both models. Future research should focus on the application of deep learning, spectral CT-derived radiomics, and a multimodal approach for accurately predicting benefit to checkpoint inhibitor treatment in advanced melanoma.",2292
36995415,Prediction of platinum resistance for advanced high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma using MRI-based radiomics nomogram.,European radiology,2023,"This study aimed to explore the value of a radiomics nomogram to identify platinum resistance and predict the progression-free survival (PFS) of patients with advanced high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC). In this multicenter retrospective study, 301 patients with advanced HGSOC underwent radiomics features extraction from the whole primary tumor on contrast-enhanced T1WI and T2WI. The radiomics features were selected by the support vector machine-based recursive feature elimination method, and then the radiomics signature was generated. Furthermore, a radiomics nomogram was developed using the radiomics signature and clinical characteristics by multivariable logistic regression. The predictive performance was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic analysis. The net reclassification index (NRI), integrated discrimination improvement (IDI), and decision curve analysis (DCA) were used to compare the clinical utility and benefits of different models. Five features significantly correlated with platinum resistance were selected to construct the radiomics model. The radiomics nomogram, combining radiomics signatures with three clinical characteristics (FIGO stage, CA-125, and residual tumor), had a higher area under the curve (AUC) compared with the clinical model alone (AUC: 0.799 vs 0.747), with positive NRI and IDI. The net benefit of the radiomics nomogram is typically higher than clinical-only and radiomics-only models. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that the radiomics nomogram-defined high-risk groups had shorter PFS compared with the low-risk groups in patients with advanced HGSOC. The radiomics nomogram can identify platinum resistance and predict PFS. It helps make the personalized management of advanced HGSOC. • The radiomics-based approach has the potential to identify platinum resistance and can help make the personalized management of advanced HGSOC. • The radiomics-clinical nomogram showed improved performance compared with either of them alone for predicting platinum-resistant HGSOC. • The proposed nomogram performed well in predicting the PFS time of patients with low-risk and high-risk HGSOC in both training and testing cohorts.",2203

We prospectively enrolled surgical resection candidates for PDAC from six tertiary referral hospitals (study identifier: NCT03895177). All participants underwent pancreatic CT using 80 kVp tube voltage with 1-mm reconstruction interval. The local resectability was prospectively evaluated using NCCN guidelines at each center and classified into three categories: resectable, borderline resectable, and unresectable. A total of 138 patients were enrolled; among them, 60 patients underwent neoadjuvant therapy. R0 resection was achieved in 103 patients (74.6%). The R0 resection rates were 88.7% (47/53), 52.4% (11/21), and 0.0% (0/4) for resectable, borderline resectable, and unresectable disease, respectively, in 78 patients who underwent upfront surgery. Meanwhile, the rates were 90.9% (20/22), 76.7% (23/30), and 25.0% (2/8) for resectable, borderline resectable, and unresectable PDAC, respectively, in patients who received neoadjuvant therapy.

This 10-year retrospective, single-site study of 110 pediatric and AYA patients with lymphoma involved manual segmentation of fat and muscle tissue from 260 CT imaging datasets obtained as part of routine imaging at initial staging and first therapeutic follow-up. A DL model was trained to perform semiautomated image segmentation of adipose and muscle tissue. The association between BC measures and the occurrence of 3-year late effects was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression analyses. DL-guided measures of BC were in close agreement with those obtained by a human rater, as demonstrated by high Dice scores (≥ 0.95) and correlations (r > 0.99) for each tissue of interest. Cox proportional hazards regression analyses revealed that patients with elevated subcutaneous adipose tissue at baseline and first follow-up, along with patients who possessed lower volumes of skeletal muscle at first follow-up, have increased risk of late effects compared to their peers. DL provides rapid and accurate quantification of image-derived measures of BC that are associated with risk for treatment-related late effects in pediatric and AYA patients with lymphoma. Image-based monitoring of BC measures may enhance future opportunities for personalized medicine for children with lymphoma by identifying patients at the highest risk for late effects of treatment. • Deep learning-guided CT image analysis of body composition measures achieved high agreement level with manual image analysis. • Pediatric patients with more fat and less muscle during the course of cancer treatment were more likely to experience a serious adverse event compared to their clinical counterparts. • Deep learning of body composition may add value to routine CT imaging by offering real-time monitoring of pediatric, adolescent, and young adults at high risk for late effects of cancer treatment.",2166

A total of 603 patients who underwent NAC were retrospectively included between January 2018 and June 2021 from three different institutions. Four different deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) were trained by pretreatment ultrasound images using annotated training dataset (n = 420) and validated in a testing cohort (n = 183). Comparing the predictive performance of these models, the best one was selected for image-only model structure. Furthermore, the integrated DLR model was constructed based on the image-only model combined with independent clinical-pathologic variables. Areas under the curve (AUCs) of these models and two radiologists were compared by using the DeLong method. As the optimal basic model, Resnet50 achieved an AUC and accuracy of 0.879 and 82.5% in the validation set. The integrated DLR model, yielding the highest classification performance in predicting response to NAC (AUC 0.962 and 0.939 in the training and validation cohort), outperformed the image-only model and the clinical model and also performed better than two radiologists' prediction (all p < 0.05). In addition, predictive efficacy of the radiologists was improved under the assistance of the DLR model significantly. The pretreatment US-based DLR model could hold promise as a clinical guidance for predicting NAC response of patients with breast cancer, thereby providing benefit of timely treatment strategy adjustment to potential poor NAC responders. • Multicenter retrospective study showed that deep learning radiomics (DLR) model based on pretreatment ultrasound image and clinical parameter achieved satisfactory prediction of tumor response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in breast cancer. • The integrated DLR model could become an effective tool to guide clinicians in identifying potential poor pathological responders before chemotherapy. • The predictive efficacy of the radiologists was improved under the assistance of the DLR model.",2228

Due to varying sample sizes, population characteristics, and follow-up times, consensus of the association is currently lacking. Purpose To confirm whether CPE is associated with long-term survival in a large multicenter retrospective cohort, and to investigate if CPE is associated with endocrine therapy effectiveness. Materials and Methods This multicenter observational cohort included women with unilateral ER-positive HER2-negative breast cancer (tumor size ≤50 mm and ≤three positive lymph nodes) who underwent MRI from January 2005 to December 2010. Overall survival (OS), recurrence-free survival (RFS), and distant RFS (DRFS) were assessed.

36964768,Validation of the SSTR-RADS 1.0 for the structured interpretation of SSTR-PET/CT and treatment planning in neuroendocrine tumor (NET) patients.,European radiology,2023,"The recently proposed standardized reporting and data system for somatostatin receptor (SSTR)-targeted PET/CT SSTR-RADS 1.0 showed promising first results in the assessment of diagnosis and treatment planning with peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) in neuroendocrine tumors (NET). This study aimed to determine the intra- and interreader agreement of SSTR-RADS 1.0. SSTR-PET/CT scans of 100 patients were independently evaluated by 4 readers with different levels of expertise according to the SSTR-RADS 1.0 criteria at 2 time points within 6 weeks. For each scan, a maximum of five target lesions were freely chosen by each reader (not more than three lesions per organ) and stratified according to the SSTR-RADS 1.0 criteria. Overall scan score and binary decision on PRRT were assessed. Intra- and interreader agreement was determined using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Interreader agreement using SSTR-RADS 1.0 for identical target lesions (ICC ≥ 0.91) and overall scan score (ICC ≥ 0.93) was excellent. The decision to state ""functional imaging fulfills requirements for PRRT and qualifies patient as potential candidate for PRRT"" also demonstrated excellent agreement among all readers (ICC ≥ 0.86). Intrareader agreement was excellent even among different experience levels when comparing target lesion-based scores (ICC ≥ 0.98), overall scan score (ICC ≥ 0.93), and decision for PRRT (ICC ≥ 0.88). SSTR-RADS 1.0 represents a highly reproducible and accurate system for stratifying SSTR-targeted PET/CT scans with high intra- and interreader agreement. The system is a promising approach to standardize the diagnosis and treatment planning in NET patients. • SSTR-RADS 1.0 offers high reproducibility and accuracy. • SSTR-RADS 1.0 is a promising method to standardize diagnosis and treatment planning for patients with NET.",1857
36963352,Observational study investigating the level of support from a convolutional neural network in face and scalp lesions deemed diagnostically 'unclear' by dermatologists.,"European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",2023,"The clinical diagnosis of face and scalp lesions (FSL) is challenging due to overlapping features. Dermatologists encountering diagnostically 'unclear' lesions may benefit from artificial intelligence support via convolutional neural networks (CNN). In a web-based classification task, dermatologists (n = 64) diagnosed a convenience sample of 100 FSL as 'benign', 'malignant', or 'unclear' and indicated their management decisions ('no action', 'follow-up', 'treatment/excision'). A market-approved CNN (Moleanalyzer-Pro®, FotoFinder Systems, Germany) was applied for binary classifications (benign/malignant) of dermoscopic images. After reviewing one dermoscopic image per case, dermatologists labelled 562 of 6400 diagnoses (8.8%) as 'unclear' and mostly managed these by follow-up examinations (57.3%, n = 322) or excisions (42.5%, n = 239). Management was incorrect in 58.8% of 291 truly malignant cases (171 'follow-up' or 'no action') and 43.9% of 271 truly benign cases (119 'excision'). Accepting CNN classifications in unclear cases would have reduced false management decisions to 4.1% in truly malignant and 31.7% in truly benign lesions (both p < 0.01). After receiving full case information 239 diagnoses (3.7%) remained 'unclear' to dermatologists, now triggering more excisions (72.0%) than follow-up examinations (28.0%). These management decisions were incorrect in 32.8% of 116 truly malignant cases and 76.4% of 123 truly benign cases. Accepting CNN classifications would have reduced false management decisions to 6.9% in truly malignant lesions and to 38.2% in truly benign cases (both p < 0.01). Dermatologists mostly managed diagnostically 'unclear' FSL by treatment/excision or follow-up examination. Following CNN classifications as guidance in unclear cases seems suitable to significantly reduce incorrect decisions.",1845
36947188,CT texture analysis reliability in pulmonary lesions: the influence of 3D vs. 2D lesion segmentation and volume definition by a Hounsfield-unit threshold.,European radiology,2023,"Reproducibility problems are a known limitation of radiomics. The segmentation of the target lesion plays a critical role in texture analysis variability. This study's aim was to compare the interobserver reliability of manual 2D vs. 3D lung lesion segmentation with and without pre-definition of the volume using a threshold of - 50 HU. Seventy-five patients with histopathologically proven lung lesions (15 patients each with adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, small cell lung cancer, carcinoid, and organizing pneumonia) who underwent an unenhanced CT scan of the chest were included. Three radiologists independently segmented each lesion manually in 3D and 2D with and without pre-segmentation volume definition by a HU threshold, and shape parameters and original, Laplacian of Gaussian-filtered, and wavelet-based texture features were derived. To assess interobserver reliability and identify the most robust texture features, intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) for different segmentation settings were calculated. Shape parameters had high reliability (64-79% had excellent and good ICCs). Texture features had weak reliability levels, with the highest ICCs (38% excellent or good) found for original features in 3D segmentation without the use of a HU threshold. A small proportion (4.3-11.5%) of texture features had excellent or good ICC values at all segmentation settings. Interobserver reliability of texture features from CT scans of a heterogeneous collection of manually segmented lung lesions was low with a small proportion of features demonstrating high reliability independent of the segmentation settings. These results indicate a limited applicability of texture analysis and the need to define robust texture features in patients with lung lesions. • Our study showed a low reproducibility of texture features when 3 radiologists independently segmented lung lesions in CT images, which highlights a serious limitation of texture analysis. • Interobserver reliability of texture features was low regardless of whether the lesion was segmented in 2D and 3D with or without a HU threshold. • In contrast to texture features, shape parameters showed a high interobserver reliability when lesions were segmented in 2D vs. 3D with and without a HU threshold of - 50.",2300

Purpose To examine recurrence patterns and associations with outcomes in patients with resected lung adenocarcinoma according to GGO at CT. Materials and Methods Patients who underwent CT followed by lobectomy or pneumonectomy for lung adenocarcinoma between July 2010 and December 2017 were retrospectively included. Patients were divided into two groups based on the presence of GGO: GGO adenocarcinoma and solid adenocarcinoma. Recurrence patterns at follow-up CT examinations were investigated and compared between the two groups. The effects of patient grouping on time to recurrence, postrecurrence survival (PRS), and overall survival (OS) were evaluated using Cox regression. Results Of 1019 patients (mean age, 62 years ± 9 [SD]; 520 women), 487 had GGO adenocarcinoma and 532 had solid adenocarcinoma. Recurrences occurred more frequently in patients with solid adenocarcinoma (36.1% [192 of 532 patients]) than in those with GGO adenocarcinoma (16.2% [79 of 487 patients]). Distant metastasis was the most common mode of recurrence in the group with solid adenocarcinoma and all clinical stages. In clinical stage I GGO adenocarcinoma, all regional recurrences appeared as ipsilateral lung metastasis (39.2% [20 of 51]) without regional lymph node metastasis. Brain metastasis was more frequent in patients with clinical stage I solid adenocarcinoma (16.5% [16 of 97 patients]).

36934744,Shortwave Infrared Imaging Enables High-Contrast Fluorescence-Guided Surgery in Neuroblastoma.,Cancer research,2023,"Fluorescence-guided surgery is set to play a pivotal role in the intraoperative management of pediatric tumors. Shortwave infrared imaging (SWIR) has advantages over conventional near-infrared I (NIR-I) imaging with reduced tissue scattering and autofluorescence. Here, two NIR-I dyes (IRDye800CW and IR12), with long tails emitting in the SWIR range, were conjugated with a clinical-grade anti-GD2 monoclonal antibody (dinutuximab-beta) to compare NIR-I and SWIR imaging for neuroblastoma surgery. A first-of-its-kind multispectral NIR-I/SWIR fluorescence imaging device was constructed to allow an objective comparison between the two imaging windows. Conjugates were first characterized in vitro. Tissue-mimicking phantoms, imaging specimens of known geometric and material composition, were used to assess the sensitivity and depth penetration of the NIR-I/SWIR device, showing a minimum detectable volume of ∼0.9 mm3 and depth penetration up to 3 mm. In vivo, fluorescence imaging using the NIR-I/SWIR device showed a high tumor-to-background ratio (TBR) for both dyes, with anti-GD2-IR800 being significantly brighter than anti-GD2-IR12. Crucially, the system enabled higher TBR at SWIR wavelengths than at NIR-I wavelengths, verifying SWIR imaging enables high-contrast delineation of tumor margins. This work demonstrates that by combining the high specificity of anti-GD2 antibodies with the availability and translatability of existing NIR-I dyes, along with the advantages of SWIR in terms of depth and tumor signal-to-background ratio, GD2-targeted NIR-I/SWIR-guided surgery could improve the treatment of patients with neuroblastoma, warranting investigation in future clinical trials. Multispectral near-infrared I/shortwave infrared fluorescence imaging is a versatile system enabling high tumor-to-background signal for safer and more complete resection of pediatric tumors during surgery.",1905

Participants were recruited and underwent four-phase dynamic CT (NCT04722120). They were randomly assigned to either standard-dose (SD) or DLD protocol. All CT images were initially reconstructed using iterative reconstruction, and the images of the DLD protocol were further processed using the DL-CB algorithm (DLD-DL). The primary endpoint was the contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), the secondary endpoint was qualitative image quality (noise, hepatic lesion, and vessel conspicuity), and the tertiary endpoint was lesion detection rate. The t-test or repeated measures analysis of variance was used for analysis. Sixty-eight participants with 57 focal liver lesions were enrolled (20 with HCC and 37 with benign findings). The DLD protocol had a 19.8% lower radiation dose (DLP, 855.1 ± 254.8 mGy·cm vs. 713.3 ± 94.6 mGy·cm, p = .003) and 27% lower contrast dose (106.9 ± 15.0 mL vs. 77.9 ± 9.4 mL, p < .001) than the SD protocol. The comparative analysis demonstrated that CNR (p < .001) and portal vein conspicuity (p = .002) were significantly higher in the DLD-DL than in the SD protocol. There was no significant difference in lesion detection rate for all lesions (82.7% vs. 73.3%, p = .140) and HCCs (75.7% vs. 70.4%, p = .644) between the SD protocol and DLD-DL. DL-CB on double-low-dose CT provided improved CNR of the aorta and portal vein without significant impairment of the detection rate of HCC compared to the standard-dose acquisition, even in participants at high risk for HCC. • Deep-learning-based contrast-boosting algorithm on double-low-dose CT provided an improved contrast-to-noise ratio compared to standard-dose CT. • The detection rate of focal liver lesions was not significantly differed between standard-dose CT and a deep-learning-based contrast-boosting algorithm on double-low-dose CT. • Double-low-dose CT without a deep-learning algorithm presented lower CNR and worse image quality.",2187

Cox proportional hazard models developed risk scoring systems whose discriminatory powers were validated using external data and compared to the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) or American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging systems using Harrell's C-index. Independent variables-tumor size (per cm; hazard ratio [HR], 1.07; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.02-1.13; p = 0.005), targetoid appearance (HR, 1.74; 95% CI: 1.07-2.83; p = 0.025), radiologic tumor in vein or tumor vascular invasion (HR, 2.59; 95% CI: 1.69-3.97; p < 0.001), the presence of a nonhypervascular hypointense nodule on the hepatobiliary phase (HR, 4.65; 95% CI: 3.03-7.14; p < 0.001), and pathologic macrovascular invasion (HR, 2.60; 95% CI: 1.51-4.48; p = 0.001)-with tumor markers (AFP ≥ 206 ng/mL or PIVKA-II ≥ 419 mAU/mL) derived pre- and postoperative risk scoring systems. The risk scores showed comparably good discriminatory powers in the validation set (C-index, 0.75-0.82) and outperformed the BCLC (C-index, 0.61) and AJCC staging systems (C-index, 0.58; ps < 0.05). The preoperative scoring system stratified the patients into low-, intermediate-, and high-risk for recurrence, whose 2-year recurrence rate was 3.3%, 31.8%, and 85.7%, respectively. The developed and validated pre- and postoperative risk scoring systems can estimate RFS after surgery for a single HCC. • The risk scoring systems predicted RFS better than the BCLC and AJCC staging systems (C-index, 0.75-0.82 vs. 0.58-0.61; ps < 0.05). • Five variables-tumor size, targetoid appearance, radiologic tumor in vein or vascular invasion, the presence of a nonhypervascular hypointense nodule on the hepatobiliary phase, and pathologic macrovascular invasion-combined with tumor markers derived risk scoring systems predicting postsurgical RFS for a single HCC. • In the risk scoring system using preoperatively-available factors, patients were classified into three distinct risk groups, with 2-year recurrence rates in the low-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups being 3.3%, 31.8%, and 85.7% in the validation set.",2415
36930854,Long-Term Performance of an Image-Based Short-Term Risk Model for Breast Cancer.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,2023,"Image-derived artificial intelligence-based short-term risk models for breast cancer have shown high discriminatory performance compared with traditional lifestyle/familial-based risk models. The long-term performance of image-derived risk models has not been investigated. We performed a case-cohort study of 8,604 randomly selected women within a mammography screening cohort initiated in 2010 in Sweden for women age 40-74 years. Mammograms, age, lifestyle, and familial risk factors were collected at study entry. In all, 2,028 incident breast cancers were identified through register matching in May 2022 (206 incident breast cancers were found in the subcohort). The image-based model extracted mammographic features (density, microcalcifications, masses, and left-right breast asymmetries of these features) and age from study entry mammograms. The Tyrer-Cuzick v8 risk model incorporates self-reported lifestyle and familial risk factors and mammographic density to estimate risk. Absolute risks were estimated, and age-adjusted AUC model performances (aAUCs) were compared across the 10-year period. The aAUCs of the image-based risk model ranged from 0.74 (95% CI, 0.70 to 0.78) to 0.65 (95% CI, 0.63 to 0.66) for breast cancers developed 1-10 years after study entry; the corresponding Tyrer-Cuzick aAUCs were 0.62 (95% CI, 0.56 to 0.67) to 0.60 (95% CI, 0.58 to 0.61). For symptomatic cancers, the aAUCs for the image-based model were ≥0.75 during the first 3 years. Women with high and low mammographic density showed similar aAUCs. Throughout the 10-year follow-up, 20% of all women with breast cancers were deemed high-risk at study entry by the image-based risk model compared with 7.1% using the lifestyle familial-based model ( The image-based risk model outperformed the Tyrer-Cuzick v8 model for both short-term and long-term risk assessment and could be used to identify women who may benefit from supplemental screening and risk reduction strategies.",1972

To evaluate the complete response rate as assessed by 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography with computed tomography (FDG-PET/CT) after salvage therapy for patients with relapsed or refractory classic Hodgkin lymphoma. A single-group, phase 2, multi-institutional nonrandomized clinical trial to evaluate the addition of pembrolizumab to ifosfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide (ICE) chemotherapy was conducted from April 20, 2017, to October 29, 2020, at 5 US sites. The 42 patients were aged 18 years or older, with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status Scale score of 0 or 1 and biopsy-proven relapsed or refractory classic Hodgkin lymphoma after 1 or 2 prior lines of chemotherapy. Patients were required to be appropriate candidates for transplant, with measurable lesions detected by FDG-PET/CT. Two cycles of pembrolizumab (200 mg intravenously on day 1) with ICE chemotherapy every 21 days, followed by stem cell mobilization and collection, and then 1 cycle of pembrolizumab monotherapy followed by FDG-PET/CT response assessment. The primary end point was complete response rate detected by FDG-PET/CT, defined as a Deauville score of 3 or lower. Patients with a complete response proceeded to an autologous stem cell transplant. Secondary end points included progression-free survival, overall survival, stem cell mobilization, and neutrophil and platelet engraftment. Adverse events were monitored to assess safety. Forty-two patients were enrolled, with 37 evaluable for the primary end point. The median age was 34 years (range, 19-70 years), 25 patients were female (68%), 6 were African American (16%), and 26 were White (70%). The complete response rate for the 37 patients assessed by FDG-PET/CT imaging was 86.5% (95% CI, 71.2%-95.5%); the overall response rate was 97.3% (36 patients), with 10.8% partial responses (4 patients). New areas of FDG-PET positivity in 2 patients were biopsied, showing noncaseating granuloma in 1 case and a reactive lymph node in a second. Progression-free survival and overall survival 2-year estimates were 87.2% (32 patients; 95% CI, 77.3%-98.3%) and 95.1% (95% CI, 88.8%-100%), respectively. The addition of pembrolizumab to ICE chemotherapy did not negatively affect stem cell mobilization or collection or engraftment, similar to prior experience in this patient population and setting. Results suggest that the addition of pembrolizumab to ICE chemotherapy was well tolerated and highly effective in comparison with prior reports of chemotherapy-only regimens, supporting further investigation in patients with relapsed or refractory classic Hodgkin lymphoma eligible for an autologous stem cell transplant.

In this retrospective study, we analyzed data from 949 screen-detected breast cancers, 305 interval cancers, and 13,646 negative examinations performed in BreastScreen Norway during the period from 2010 to 2018. An AI system scored the examinations from 1 to 10, based on the risk of malignancy. Results from the AI system were compared to screening results after independent double reading. AI score 10 was set as the threshold. The results were stratified by mammographic density. A total of 92.7% of the screen-detected and 40.0% of the interval cancers had an AI score of 10. Among women with a negative screening outcome, 9.1% had an AI score of 10. For women with the highest breast density, the AI system scored 100% of the screen-detected cancers and 48.6% of the interval cancers with an AI score of 10, which resulted in a sensitivity of 80.9% for women with the highest breast density for the AI system, compared to 62.8% for independent double reading. For women with screen-detected cancers who had prior mammograms available, 41.9% had an AI score of 10 at the prior screening round.

ROC analysis was performed to evaluate the diagnostic performance and determine the best diagnostic criterion for arterial invasion, with pathological or surgical findings as references. Interobserver variability was assessed using Fleiss's ĸ statistics. Among the 128 patients, 35.2% (n = 45/128) received neoadjuvant treatment (NTx). Solid soft tissue contact ≤ 180° was the best diagnostic criterion for arterial invasion as defined by the Youden Index both in patients who did and did not receive NTx (sensitivity, 100% vs. 100%; specificity, 90% vs. 93%; and AUC, 0.96 vs. 0.98, respectively). Interobserver variability among the non-expert was not inferior to that among the expert (ĸ = 0.61 vs 0.61; p = .39 and ĸ = 0.59 vs 0.51; p < .001 in patients treated with and without NTx, respectively). Solid soft tissue contact ≤ 180° was the best diagnostic criterion for the determination of arterial invasion in PDAC. Considerable interobserver variability was seen among the radiologists. • Solid soft tissue contact ≤ 180° was the best diagnostic criterion for the determination of arterial invasion in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. • Interobserver agreement among non-expert radiologists was almost comparable to that among expert radiologists.",1970
36897347,"Grading meningiomas with diffusion metrics: a comparison between diffusion kurtosis, mean apparent propagator, neurite orientation dispersion and density, and diffusion tensor imaging.",European radiology,2023,"To compare the histogram features of multiple diffusion metrics in predicting the grade and cellular proliferation of meningiomas. Diffusion spectrum imaging was performed in 122 meningiomas (30 males, 13-84 years), which were divided into 31 high-grade meningiomas (HGMs, grades 2 and 3) and 91 low-grade meningiomas (LGMs, grade 1). The histogram features of multiple diffusion metrics obtained from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI), mean apparent propagator (MAP), and neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) in the solid tumours were analysed. All values between the two groups were compared with the Man-Whitney U test. Logistic regression analysis was applied to predict meningioma grade. The correlation between diffusion metrics and Ki-67 index was analysed. The DKI_AK (axial kurtosis) maximum, DKI_AK range, MAP_RTPP (return-to-plane probability) maximum, MAP_RTPP range, NODDI_ICVF (intracellular volume fraction) range, and NODDI_ICVF maximum values were lower (p < 0.0001), whilst the DTI_MD (mean diffusivity) minimum values were higher in LGMs than those in HGMs (p < 0.001). Amongst the DTI, DKI, MAP, NODDI, and combined diffusion models, no significant differences were found in areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) for grading meningiomas (AUCs, 0.75, 0.75, 0.80, 0.79, and 0.86, respectively; all corrected p > 0.05, Bonferroni correction). Significant but weak positive correlations were found between the Ki-67 index and DKI, MAP, and NODDI metrics (r = 0.26-0.34, all p < 0.05). Whole tumour histogram analyses of the multiple diffusion metrics from four diffusion models are promising methods in grading meningiomas. The DTI model has similar diagnostic performance compared with advanced diffusion models. • Whole tumour histogram analyses of multiple diffusion models are feasible for grading meningiomas. • The DKI, MAP, and NODDI metrics are weakly associated with the Ki-67 proliferation status. • DTI has similar diagnostic performance compared with DKI, MAP, and NODDI in grading meningiomas.",2101

This retrospective study enrolled 342 hepatic lesions ≤ 3.0 cm in 319 patients that underwent Gd-EOB-MRIs from January 2018 to March 2021. During dynamic phases and hepatobiliary phase, the modified capsule appearance added the nonenhancing capsule (NEC) (modified LI-RADS + NEC) or corona enhancement (CoE) (modified LI-RADS + CoE) to EC as an alternative capsule appearance. Inter-reader agreement of imaging features was assessed. The diagnostic performances of LI-RADS, LI-RADS with EC ignored, and two modified LI-RADS were compared, followed by Bonferroni correction. Multivariable regression analysis was performed to identify the independent features associated with the histological fibrous capsule. The inter-reader agreement on EC (0.64) was lower than that on the NEC alternative (0.71) but better than that on CoE alternative (0.58). For HCC diagnosis, compared to LI-RADS, LI-RADS with EC ignored showed significantly lower sensitivity (72.7% vs. 67.4%, p < 0.001) with comparable specificity (89.3% vs. 90.7%, p = 1.000). Two modified LI-RADS showed slightly higher sensitivity and lower specificity than LI-RADS, without statistical significance (all p ≥ 0.006). The AUC was highest with modified LI-RADS + NEC (0.82). Both EC and NEC were significantly associated with the fibrous capsule (p < 0.05). EC appearance improved the diagnostic sensitivity of LI-RADS for HCC ≤ 3.0 cm on Gd-EOB-MRI. Considering NEC as an alternative capsule appearance allowed for better inter-reader reliability and comparable diagnostic ability. • Using the enhancing capsule as a major feature in LI-RADS significantly improved the sensitivity of diagnosing HCC ≤ 3.0 cm without reducing specificity on gadoxetate disodium-enhanced MRI. • Compared to the corona enhancement, the nonenhancing capsule might be a preferable alternative capsule appearance for diagnosing HCC ≤ 3.0 cm. • Capsule appearance should be considered a major feature in LI-RADS for diagnosing HCC ≤ 3.0 cm, regardless whether the capsule appears to be enhancing or nonenhancing.",2341
36894753,Exploratory analysis of mesenteric-portal axis CT radiomic features for survival prediction of patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.,European radiology,2023,"To develop and evaluate task-based radiomic features extracted from the mesenteric-portal axis for prediction of survival and response to neoadjuvant therapy in patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Consecutive patients with PDAC who underwent surgery after neoadjuvant therapy from two academic hospitals between December 2012 and June 2018 were retrospectively included. Two radiologists performed a volumetric segmentation of PDAC and mesenteric-portal axis (MPA) using a segmentation software on CT scans before (CTtp0) and after (CTtp1) neoadjuvant therapy. Segmentation masks were resampled into uniform 0.625-mm voxels to develop task-based morphologic features (n = 57). These features aimed to assess MPA shape, MPA narrowing, changes in shape and diameter between CTtp0 and CTtp1, and length of MPA segment affected by the tumor. A Kaplan-Meier curve was generated to estimate the survival function. To identify reliable radiomic features associated with survival, a Cox proportional hazards model was used. Features with an ICC  ≥ 0.80 were used as candidate variables, with clinical features included a priori. In total, 107 patients (60 men) were included. The median survival time was 895 days (95% CI: 717, 1061). Three task-based shape radiomic features (Eccentricity mean tp0, Area minimum value tp1, and Ratio 2 minor tp1) were selected. The model showed an integrated AUC of 0.72 for prediction of survival. The hazard ratio for the Area minimum value tp1 feature was 1.78 (p = 0.02) and 0.48 for the Ratio 2 minor tp1 feature (p = 0.002). Preliminary results suggest that task-based shape radiomic features can predict survival in PDAC patients. • In a retrospective study of 107 patients who underwent neoadjuvant therapy followed by surgery for PDAC, task-based shape radiomic features were extracted and analyzed from the mesenteric-portal axis. • A Cox proportional hazards model that included three selected radiomic features plus clinical information showed an integrated AUC of 0.72 for prediction of survival, and a better fit compared to the model with only clinical information.",2125

In this phantom study, 59 different phantom arrangements with 326 artificial nodules (178 solid, 148 ground-glass) were scanned at 80 kV, 100 kV, and 120 kV. Four different nodule diameters were used: 5 mm, 8 mm, 10 mm, and 12 mm. Scans were analyzed by a deep-learning (DL)-based CAD and a standard CAD system. Relative volumetric errors (RVE) of each system vs. ground truth and the relative volume difference (RVD) DL-based vs. standard CAD were calculated. The Bland-Altman method was used to define the limits of agreement (LOA). The hypothetical impact on LungRADS classification was assessed for both systems. There was no difference between the three voltage groups regarding nodule volumetry. Regarding the solid nodules, the RVE of the 5-mm-, 8-mm-, 10-mm-, and 12-mm-size groups for the DL CAD/standard CAD were 12.2/2.8%, 1.3/ - 2.8%, - 3.6/1.5%, and - 12.2/ - 0.3%, respectively. The corresponding values for the ground-glass nodules (GGN) were 25.6%/81.0%, 9.0%/28.0%, 7.6/20.6%, and 6.8/21.2%. The mean RVD for solid nodules/GGN was 1.3/ - 15.2%. Regarding the LungRADS classification, 88.5% and 79.8% of all solid nodules were correctly assigned by the DL CAD and the standard CAD, respectively. 14.9% of the nodules were assigned differently between the systems. Patient management may be affected by the volumetric inaccuracy of the CAD systems and hence demands supervision and/or manual correction by a radiologist. • The DL-based CAD system was more accurate in the volumetry of GGN and less accurate regarding solid nodules than the standard CAD system. • Nodule size and attenuation have an effect on the measurement accuracy of both systems; tube voltage has no effect on measurement accuracy. • Measurement inaccuracies of CAD systems can have an impact on patient management, which demands supervision by radiologists.",2066

The study enrolled 166 patients with histopathological confirmed MVI-negative HCC retrospectively. The MR imaging features were evaluated by two radiologists independently. The risk factors associated with recurrence-free survival (RFS) were identified by univariate Cox regression analysis and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator Cox regression analysis. A predictive nomogram was developed based on these risk factors, and the performance was tested in the validation cohort. The RFS was analyzed by using the Kaplan-Meier survival curves and log-rank test. Among the 166 patients with solitary MVI-negative HCC, 86 patients presented with postoperative recurrence. Multivariate Cox regression analysis indicated that cirrhosis, tumor size, hepatitis, albumin, arterial phase hyperenhancement (APHE), washout, and mosaic architecture were risk factors associated with poor RFS and then incorporated into the nomogram. The nomogram achieved good performance with C-index values of 0.713 and 0.707 in the development and validation cohorts, respectively. Furthermore, patients were stratified into high- and low-risk subgroups, and significant prognostic differences were found between the different subgroups in both cohorts (p < 0.001 and p = 0.024, respectively). The nomogram incorporated preoperative MR imaging features, and clinical parameters can be a simple and reliable tool for predicting RFS and achieving risk stratification in patients with solitary MVI-negative HCC. • Application of preoperative MR imaging features and clinical parameters can effectively predict RFS in patients with solitary MVI-negative HCC. • Risk factors including cirrhosis, tumor size, hepatitis, albumin, APHE, washout, and mosaic architecture were associated with worse prognosis in patients with solitary MVI-negative HCC. • Based on the nomogram incorporating these risk factors, the MVI-negative HCC patients could be stratified into two subgroups with significant different prognoses.",2229

Nevertheless, CNS infiltration is rarely detected at the initial diagnosis. The glymphatic system, which regulates cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and interstitial fluid transport, is considered one of the possible routes of CNS infiltration by leukemia cells. In this study, we used diffusion tensor image analysis along the perivascular space (DTI-ALPS) method to investigate glymphatic system function and obtained CSF volume using synthetic magnetic resonance imaging (SyMRI) in pediatric ALL without clinically diagnosed CNS infiltration. Twenty-nine ALL and 29 typically developing (TD) children were prospectively recruited (age 4-16 years) in the present study.

The differential diagnosis between IIP and other types of pneumonitis (OTP) remains challenging due to similar radiological patterns. This study was aimed to develop a prediction model to differentiate IIP from OTP in patients with stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who developed pneumonitis during immunotherapy. Consecutive patients with metastatic NSCLC treated with immunotherapy in six centres in the Netherlands and Belgium from 2017 to 2020 were reviewed and cause-specific pneumonitis events were identified. Seven regions of interest (segmented lungs and spheroidal/cubical regions surrounding the inflammation) were examined to extract the most predictive radiomic features from the chest computed tomography images obtained at pneumonitis manifestation. Models were internally tested regarding discrimination, calibration and decisional benefit. To evaluate the clinical application of the models, predicted labels were compared with the separate clinical and radiological judgements. A total of 556 patients were reviewed; 31 patients (5.6%) developed IIP and 41 patients developed OTP (7.4%). The line of immunotherapy was the only predictive factor in the clinical model (2nd versus 1st odds ratio = 0.08, 95% confidence interval:0.01-0.77). The best radiomic model was achieved using a 75-mm spheroidal region of interest which showed an optimism-corrected area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.83 (95% confidence interval:0.77-0.95) with negative and positive predictive values of 80% and 79%, respectively. Good calibration and net benefits were achieved for the radiomic model across the entire range of probabilities. A correct diagnosis was provided by the radiomic model in 10 out of 12 cases with non-conclusive radiological judgements. Radiomic biomarkers applied to computed tomography imaging may support clinicians making the differential diagnosis of pneumonitis in patients with NSCLC receiving immunotherapy, especially when the radiologic assessment is non-conclusive.",2176

This study aimed to develop and adapt two (MLO, CC) deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN) for automatic breast density classification on synthetic 2D tomosynthesis reconstructions. In total, 4605 synthetic 2D images (1665 patients, age: 57 ± 37 years) were labeled according to the ACR (American College of Radiology) density (A-D). Two DCNNs with 11 convolutional layers and 3 fully connected layers each, were trained with 70% of the data, whereas 20% was used for validation. The remaining 10% were used as a separate test dataset with 460 images (380 patients). All mammograms in the test dataset were read blinded by two radiologists (reader 1 with two and reader 2 with 11 years of dedicated mammographic experience in breast imaging), and the consensus was formed as the reference standard. The inter- and intra-reader reliabilities were assessed by calculating Cohen's kappa coefficients, and diagnostic accuracy measures of automated classification were evaluated. The two models for MLO and CC projections had a mean sensitivity of 80.4% (95%-CI 72.2-86.9), a specificity of 89.3% (95%-CI 85.4-92.3), and an accuracy of 89.6% (95%-CI 88.1-90.9) in the differentiation between ACR A/B and ACR C/D.

We assessed whether quantification of pulmonary emphysematous changes at baseline LDCT has a predictive value concerning long-term mortality. In this longitudinal study, we assessed pulmonary emphysematous changes with densitometry (volume corrected relative area below - 950 Hounsfield units) and coronary artery calcifications (CAC) with a 0-3 visual scale in baseline LDCT of 524 participants in the ITALUNG trial and analyzed their association with mortality after 13.6 years of follow-up using conventional statistics and a machine learning approach. Pulmonary emphysematous changes were present in 32.3% of subjects and were mild (6% ≤ RA950 ≤ 9%) in 14.9% and moderate-severe (RA950 > 9%) in 17.4%. CAC were present in 67% of subjects (mild in 34.7%, moderate-severe in 32.2%). In the follow-up, 81 (15.4%) subjects died (20 of LC, 28 of other cancers, 15 of CVD, 4 of respiratory disease, and 14 of other conditions). After adjusting for age, sex, smoking history, and CAC, moderate-severe emphysema was significantly associated with overall (OR 2.22; 95CI 1.34-3.70) and CVD (OR 3.66; 95CI 1.21-11.04) mortality. Machine learning showed that RA950 was the best single feature predictive of overall and CVD mortality. Moderate-severe pulmonary emphysematous changes are an independent predictor of long-term overall and CVD mortality in subjects participating in LC screening and should be incorporated in the post-test calculation of the individual mortality risk profile. • Densitometry allows quantification of pulmonary emphysematous changes in low-dose CT examinations for lung cancer screening. • Emphysematous lung density changes are an independent predictor of long-term overall and cardio-vascular disease mortality in smokers and former smokers undergoing screening. • Emphysematous changes quantification should be included in the post-test calculation of the individual mortality risk profile.",2107

We extracted 1197 radiomic features from each sequence of conventional MRI and DSC-PWI, respectively. The Boruta algorithm was used for feature selection and combination, and a three-class random forest method was applied to construct the models. We also constructed a combined model by integrating radiomic features and clinical metrics. The models' diagnostic performance for discriminating the molecular subtypes (IDH wild type [IDHwt], IDH mutant and 1p/19q-noncodeleted [IDHmut-noncodel], and IDH mutant and 1p/19q-codeleted [IDHmut-codel]) was compared using AUCs in the validation set. We included 272 patients (training set, n = 166; validation set, n = 106) with grade II-IV gliomas (mean age, 48.7 years; range, 19-77 years). The proportions of the molecular subtypes were 66.2% IDHwt, 15.1% IDHmut-noncodel, and 18.8% IDHmut-codel. Nineteen radiomic features (13 from conventional MRI and 6 from DSC-PWI) were selected to build the multimodal radiomic model. In the validation set, the multimodal radiomic model showed better performance than the conventional radiomic model did in predicting the IDHwt and IDHmut-codel subtypes, which was comparable to the conventional radiomic model in predicting the IDHmut-noncodel subtype. The multimodal radiomic model yielded similar performance as the combined model in predicting the three molecular subtypes. Adding DSC-PWI to conventional MRI can improve molecular subtype prediction in patients with diffuse gliomas. • The multimodal radiomic model outperformed conventional MRI when predicting both the IDH wild type and IDH mutant and 1p/19q-codeleted subtypes of gliomas. • The multimodal radiomic model showed comparable performance to the combined model in the prediction of the three molecular subtypes. • Radiomic features from T1-weighted gadolinium contrast-enhanced and relative cerebral blood volume images played an important role in the prediction of molecular subtypes.",2278

This work prospectively included 196 surgically resected LAGC patients (139 males, 57 females, 59.55 ± 11.97 years) undergoing triple enhanced spectral CT scans. Patients were labeled as perineural invasion (PNI) positive and negative according to pathologic reports, then further split into primary (n = 130) and validation cohort (n = 66). We extracted clinicopathological information, follow-up data, iodine concentration (IC), and normalized IC values against to aorta (nICs) at arterial/venous/delayed phases (AP/VP/DP). Clinicopathological features and IC values between PNI positive and negative groups were compared. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to screen independent risk factors of PNI. Then, a nomogram was established, and its capability was determined by ROC curves. Its clinical use was evaluated by decision curve analysis. The correlations of PNI and the nomogram with patients' survival were explored by log-rank survival analysis. Borrmann classification, tumor thickness, and nICDP were independent predictors of PNI and used to build the nomogram. The nomogram yielded higher AUCs of 0.853 (0.744-0.928) and 0.782 (0.701-0.850) in primary and validation cohorts than any other parameters (p < 0.05). Both PNI and the nomogram were related to post-surgical treatment planning. Only PNI was associated with disease-free survival in the primary cohort (p < 0.05). This work prospectively established a spectral CT-based nomogram, which can effectively predict PNI preoperatively and potentially guide post-surgical treatment strategy in LAGC. • The present prospective study established a spectral CT-based nomogram for preoperative prediction of perineural invasion in LAGC. • The proposed nomogram, including morphological features and the quantitative iodine concentration values from spectral CT, had the potential to predict PNI for LAGC before surgery, along with guide post-surgical treatment planning. • Normalized iodine concentration at the delayed phase was the most valuable quantitative parameter, suggesting the importance of delayed enhancement in gastric CT.",2284
36826497,High-resolution integrated dynamic shimming diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) in the assessment of rectal cancer.,European radiology,2023,"To investigate the feasibility of high-resolution integrated dynamic shimming echo planar imaging (iEPI) applied to rectal cancer. A total of seventy-eight patients with non-mucinous rectum adenocarcinoma were enrolled in this study. Using a prototype high-resolution iEPI sequence, high-resolution single-shot EPI (sEPI) sequence, and sEPI sequence, subjective and objective assessment and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) value were measured for comparison. The spearman rank correlation analysis test and the receiver operating characteristic curve were performed to evaluate correlation between tumor ADC values, corresponding T stage, and differentiation degree of rectal cancer. The subjective assessment of the image quality (IQ) of high-resolution iEPI was rated superior to high-resolution sEPI and sEPI by both readers (p < 0.001). Signal-to-noise ratio, contrast-to-noise, and signal-intensity ratio were significantly higher in high-resolution iEPI than the other two sequences (p < 0.001). There was no significant difference of tumor ADC values among three EPI sequences in the group of low- to well-differentiated rectal cancer. An inverse correlation was noted between ADC values on three DWI sequences and pathological T stage of rectal cancer (r =  - 0.693, - 0.689, - 0.640, p < 0.001). The AUC values of high-resolution iEPI, high-resolution sEPI, and sEPI in predicting well-differentiated rectal cancer were 0.910, 0.761, and 0.725 respectively. In conclusion, the high-resolution iEPI provided significantly higher IQ and stable ADC compared to another two sequences. High-resolution iEPI has the highest efficacy among three examined sequences in differentiation of rectal cancer with different degrees of differentiation. • High-resolution iEPI provided a significantly better IQ than high-resolution sEPI and sEPI when assessing rectal cancer. • The AUC of high-resolution sEPI was the highest among three EPI sequences in predicting well-differentiated rectal cancer.",1998
36814032,MRI assessment of rectal cancer response to neoadjuvant therapy: a multireader study.,European radiology,2023,"A watch and wait strategy with the goal of organ preservation is an emerging treatment paradigm for rectal cancer following neoadjuvant treatment. However, the selection of appropriate patients remains a challenge. Most previous efforts to measure the accuracy of MRI in assessing rectal cancer response used a small number of radiologists and did not report variability among them. Twelve radiologists from 8 institutions assessed baseline and restaging MRI scans of 39 patients. The participating radiologists were asked to assess MRI features and to categorize the overall response as complete or incomplete. The reference standard was pathological complete response or a sustained clinical response for > 2 years. We measured the accuracy and described the interobserver variability of interpretation of rectal cancer response between radiologists at different medical centers. Overall accuracy was 64%, with a sensitivity of 65% for detecting complete response and specificity of 63% for detecting residual tumor. Interpretation of the overall response was more accurate than the interpretation of any individual feature. Variability of interpretation was dependent on the patient and imaging feature investigated. In general, variability and accuracy were inversely correlated. MRI-based evaluation of response at restaging is insufficiently accurate and has substantial variability of interpretation. Although some patients' response to neoadjuvant treatment on MRI may be easily recognizable, as seen by high accuracy and low variability, that is not the case for most patients. • The overall accuracy of MRI-based response assessment is low and radiologists differed in their interpretation of key imaging features. • Some patients' scans were interpreted with high accuracy and low variability, suggesting that these patients' pattern of response is easier to interpret. • The most accurate assessments were those of the overall response, which took into consideration both T2W and DWI sequences and the assessment of both the primary tumor and the lymph nodes.",2071

Purpose To investigate the added value of pelvic coverage at follow-up liver CT in detecting pelvic metastasis or incidental tumors in patients treated for HCC. Materials and Methods This retrospective study included patients who were diagnosed with HCC between January 2016 and December 2017 and followed up with liver CT after treatment. Cumulative rates of extrahepatic metastasis, isolated pelvic metastasis, and incidental pelvic tumor were estimated by using the Kaplan-Meier method. Cox proportional hazard models were used to identify risk factors for extrahepatic and isolated pelvic metastases. Radiation dose from pelvic coverage was also calculated. Results A total of 1122 patients (mean age, 60 years ± 10 [SD]; 896 men) were included.

A total of 232 patients were included in the study. The tumour-pleura relationship was divided into four types: type 1, the tumour was unrelated to the pleura; type 2, the tumour was not in contact with the pleura, and one or more linear or striated pleural tags were visible; type 3, the tumour was not in contact with the pleura, and one or more linear or striated pleural tags with soft tissue component at the pleural end were visible; and type 4, the tumour was in contact with the pleura. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to identify the predictive factors, including the tumour-pleura relationship, clinical factors, conventional CT findings, and pathology-reported visceral pleural invasion, for OLNM. Type 3 and 4 tumour-pleura relationships were more likely to have visceral pleural invasion than type 1 and 2 tumour-pleura relationships (p < 0.001). Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses revealed that the type 3 or 4 tumour-pleura relationship (OR: 3.261, p = 0.026), carcinoembryonic antigen level (OR: 3.361, p = 0.006), cytokeratin 19 fragments level (OR: 2.539, p = 0.025), and mediastinal window tumour size (OR: 1.078, p = 0.020) were predictive factors for OLNM. The type 3 or 4 tumour-pleura relationship is correlated with a greater risk of OLNM in peripheral clinical stage IA solid adenocarcinoma. • The tumour-pleura relationship on CT is a risk factor for occult lymph node metastasis in peripheral clinical stage IA solid adenocarcinoma. • Other risk factors for OLNM include CEA level, CYFRA level, and mediastinal window tumour size. • Pathology-reported visceral pleural invasion is not a risk factor for OLNM.",1885
36790469,An ordinal radiomic model to predict the differentiation grade of invasive non-mucinous pulmonary adenocarcinoma based on low-dose computed tomography in lung cancer screening.,European radiology,2023,"To construct a radiomic model of low-dose CT (LDCT) to predict the differentiation grade of invasive non-mucinous pulmonary adenocarcinoma (IPA) and compare its diagnostic performance with quantitative-semantic model and radiologists. A total of 682 pulmonary nodules were divided into the primary cohort (181 grade 1; 254 grade 2; 64 grade 3) and validation cohort (69 grade 1; 99 grade 2; 15 grade 3) according to scanners. The radiomic and quantitative-semantic models were built using ordinal logistic regression. The diagnostic performance of the models and radiologists was assessed by the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic curve and accuracy. The radiomic model demonstrated excellent diagnostic performance in the validation cohort (AUC, 0.900 (95%CI: 0.847-0.939) for Grade 1 vs. Grade 2/Grade 3; AUC, 0.929 (95%CI: 0.882-0.962) for Grade 1/Grade 2 vs. Grade 3; accuracy, 0.803 (95%CI: 0.737-0.857)). No significant difference in diagnostic performance was found between the radiomic model and radiological expert (AUC, 0.840 (95%CI: 0.779-0.890) for Grade 1 vs. Grade 2/Grade 3, p = 0.130; AUC, 0.852 (95%CI: 0.793-0.900) for Grade 1/Grade 2 vs. Grade 3, p = 0.170; accuracy, 0.743 (95%CI: 0.673-0.804), p = 0.079), but the radiomic model outperformed the quantitative-semantic model and inexperienced radiologists (all p < 0.05). The radiomic model of LDCT can be used to predict the differentiation grade of IPA in lung cancer screening, and its diagnostic performance is comparable to that of radiological expert. • Early identifying the novel differentiation grade of invasive non-mucinous pulmonary adenocarcinoma may provide guidance for further surveillance, surgical strategy, or more adjuvant treatment. • The diagnostic performance of the radiomic model is comparable to that of a radiological expert and superior to that of the quantitative-semantic model and inexperienced radiologists. • The radiomic model of low-dose CT can be used to predict the differentiation grade of invasive non-mucinous pulmonary adenocarcinoma in lung cancer screening.",2103
36786905,Deep learning nomogram based on Gd-EOB-DTPA MRI for predicting early recurrence in hepatocellular carcinoma after hepatectomy.,European radiology,2023,"The accurate prediction of post-hepatectomy early recurrence in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is crucial for decision-making regarding postoperative adjuvant treatment and monitoring. We aimed to explore the feasibility of deep learning (DL) features derived from gadoxetate disodium (Gd-EOB-DTPA) MRI, qualitative features, and clinical variables for predicting early recurrence. In this bicentric study, 285 patients with HCC who underwent Gd-EOB-DTPA MRI before resection were divided into training (n = 195) and validation (n = 90) sets. DL features were extracted from contrast-enhanced MRI images using VGGNet-19. Three feature selection methods and five classification methods were combined for DL signature construction. Subsequently, an mp-MR DL signature fused with multiphase DL signatures of contrast-enhanced images was constructed. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to identify early recurrence risk factors including mp-MR DL signature, microvascular invasion (MVI), and tumor number. A DL nomogram was built by incorporating deep features and significant clinical variables to achieve early recurrence prediction. MVI (p = 0.039), tumor number (p = 0.001), and mp-MR DL signature (p < 0.001) were independent risk factors for early recurrence. The DL nomogram outperformed the clinical nomogram in the training set (AUC: 0.949 vs. 0.751; p < 0.001) and validation set (AUC: 0.909 vs. 0.715; p = 0.002). Excellent DL nomogram calibration was achieved in both training and validation sets. Decision curve analysis confirmed the clinical usefulness of DL nomogram. The proposed DL nomogram was superior to the clinical nomogram in predicting early recurrence for HCC patients after hepatectomy. • Deep learning signature based on Gd-EOB-DTPA MRI was the predominant independent predictor of early recurrence for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after hepatectomy. • Deep learning nomogram based on clinical factors and Gd-EOB-DTPA MRI features is promising for predicting early recurrence of HCC. • Deep learning nomogram outperformed the conventional clinical nomogram in predicting early recurrence.",2160
36786702,VICT2 Trait: Prognostic Alternative to Peritumoral Hepatobiliary Phase Hypointensity in HCC.,Radiology,2023,"Background Peritumoral hepatobiliary phase (HBP) hypointensity is an established prognostic imaging feature in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), often associated with microvascular invasion (MVI). Similar prognostic features are needed for non-HBP MRI. Purpose To propose a non-hepatobiliary-specific MRI tool with similar prognostic value to peritumoral HBP hypointensity. Materials and Methods From December 2011 to November 2021, consecutive patients with HCC who underwent preoperative contrast-enhanced MRI were retrospectively enrolled and followed up until recurrence. All MRI scans were reviewed by two blinded radiologists with 7 and 10 years of experiences with liver MRI. A scoring system based on non-hepatobiliary-specific features that highly correlated with peritumoral HBP hypointensity was identified in a stratified sampling-derived training set of the gadoxetate disodium (EOB) group by means of multivariable logistic regression, and its values to predict MVI and recurrence-free survival (RFS) were assessed.

36749370,Time series radiomics for the prediction of prostate cancer progression in patients on active surveillance.,European radiology,2023,"Serial MRI is an essential assessment tool in prostate cancer (PCa) patients enrolled on active surveillance (AS). However, it has only moderate sensitivity for predicting histopathological tumour progression at follow-up, which is in part due to the subjective nature of its clinical reporting and variation among centres and readers. In this study, we used a long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network (RNN) to develop a time series radiomics (TSR) predictive model that analysed longitudinal changes in tumour-derived radiomic features across 297 scans from 76 AS patients, 28 with histopathological PCa progression and 48 with stable disease. Using leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV), we found that an LSTM-based model combining TSR and serial PSA density (AUC 0.86 [95% CI: 0.78-0.94]) significantly outperformed a model combining conventional delta-radiomics and delta-PSA density (0.75 [0.64-0.87]; p = 0.048) and achieved comparable performance to expert-performed serial MRI analysis using the Prostate Cancer Radiologic Estimation of Change in Sequential Evaluation (PRECISE) scoring system (0.84 [0.76-0.93]; p = 0.710). The proposed TSR framework, therefore, offers a feasible quantitative tool for standardising serial MRI assessment in PCa AS. It also presents a novel methodological approach to serial image analysis that can be used to support clinical decision-making in multiple scenarios, from continuous disease monitoring to treatment response evaluation. KEY POINTS: •LSTM RNN can be used to predict the outcome of PCa AS using time series changes in tumour-derived radiomic features and PSA density. •Using all available TSR features and serial PSA density yields a significantly better predictive performance compared to using just two time points within the delta-radiomics framework. •The concept of TSR can be applied to other clinical scenarios involving serial imaging, setting out a new field in AI-driven radiology research.",1971

Purpose To investigate whether commercial AI-based CAD software could improve the detection rate of actionable lung nodules on chest radiographs in participants undergoing health checkups. Materials and Methods In this single-center, pragmatic, open-label randomized controlled trial, participants who underwent chest radiography between July 2020 and December 2021 in a health screening center were enrolled and randomized into intervention (AI group) and control (non-AI group) arms. One of three designated radiologists with 13-36 years of experience interpreted each radiograph, referring to the AI-based CAD results for the AI group. The primary outcome was the detection rate, that is, the number of true-positive radiographs divided by the total number of radiographs, of actionable lung nodules confirmed on CT scans obtained within 3 months. Actionable nodules were defined as solid nodules larger than 8 mm or subsolid nodules with a solid portion larger than 6 mm (Lung Imaging Reporting and Data System, or Lung-RADS, category 4). Secondary outcomes included the positive-report rate, sensitivity, false-referral rate, and malignant lung nodule detection rate.

36749212,Beyond Breast Density: Risk Measures for Breast Cancer in Multiple Imaging Modalities.,Radiology,2023,"Breast density is an independent risk factor for breast cancer. In digital mammography and digital breast tomosynthesis, breast density is assessed visually using the four-category scale developed by the American College of Radiology Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (5th edition as of November 2022). Epidemiologically based risk models, such as the Tyrer-Cuzick model (version 8), demonstrate superior modeling performance when mammographic density is incorporated. Beyond just density, a separate mammographic measure of breast cancer risk is parenchymal textural complexity. With advancements in radiomics and deep learning, mammographic textural patterns can be assessed quantitatively and incorporated into risk models. Other supplemental screening modalities, such as breast US and MRI, offer independent risk measures complementary to those derived from mammography. Breast US allows the two components of fibroglandular tissue (stromal and glandular) to be visualized separately in a manner that is not possible with mammography. A higher glandular component at screening breast US is associated with higher risk. With MRI, a higher background parenchymal enhancement of the fibroglandular tissue has also emerged as an imaging marker for risk assessment. Imaging markers observed at mammography, US, and MRI are powerful tools in refining breast cancer risk prediction, beyond mammographic density alone.",1422
36749210,Resolution of Nonmass Enhancement Extension to the Nipple at Breast MRI after Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy: Pathologic Response and Feasibility for Nipple-sparing Mastectomy.,Radiology,2023,"Background Nipple-sparing mastectomy (NSM) is usually contraindicated in patients with nonmass enhancement (NME) extension to the nipple at breast MRI. However, little is known about the feasibility of NSM when NME extension to the nipple resolves after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). Purpose To evaluate whether NSM is an appropriate surgical procedure for patients in whom NME extension to the nipple resolves after NAC. Materials and Methods This retrospective study included 383 women with NME at baseline MRI who underwent NAC followed by mastectomy between January 2007 and March 2022 at a single institution. NME extension to the nipple was assessed using breast MRI before NAC (hereafter, pre-NAC) and after NAC (hereafter, post-NAC). In 326 women who underwent mastectomy with removal of the nipple-areolar complex, the rate of pathologic analysis-confirmed tumor invasion of the nipple compared with NME extension to the nipple at post-NAC breast MRI was evaluated. Tumor involvement of the nipple was also assessed in those with complete pathologic response at posttreatment MRI. Furthermore, the outcomes in 57 women undergoing NSM were investigated, particularly in patients with NME extension to the nipple at initial diagnosis. Results Of the 326 women who underwent mastectomy with removal of the nipple-areolar complex (mean age, 49 years ± 9.4 [SD]), 217 patients (67%) showed NME extension to the nipple on pre-NAC MRI scans. Among the 153 women (70%) in whom the NME extension to the nipple resolved after NAC, the rate of pathologic analysis-confirmed tumor invasion of the nipple was 2.6% (four of 153 women; 95% CI: 0, 6.5). No pathologic analysis-confirmed tumor invasion of the nipple was detected in 31 women with complete response at MRI. Of the 57 women who underwent NSM, 12 (21%) with resolution of NME extension to the nipple after NAC had no relapse during the median follow-up of 31 months (range, 11-80 months). Conclusion Pathologic analysis-confirmed tumor invasion of the nipple was rare in women with resolution of nonmass enhancement extension to the nipple after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). Therefore, nipple-sparing mastectomy could be feasible in this population, especially in those with complete MRI response to NAC. © RSNA, 2023 ",2279
36738323,Shape and texture analyses based on conventional MRI for the preoperative prediction of the aggressiveness of pituitary adenomas.,European radiology,2023,"Pituitary adenomas can exhibit aggressive behavior, characterized by rapid growth, resistance to conventional treatment, and early recurrence. This study aims to evaluate the clinical value of shape-related features combined with textural features based on conventional MRI in evaluating the aggressiveness of pituitary adenomas and develop the best diagnostic model. Two hundred forty-six pituitary adenoma patients (84 aggressive, 162 non-aggressive) who underwent preoperative MRI were retrospectively reviewed. The patients were divided into training (n = 193) and testing (n = 53) sets. Clinical information, shape-related, and textural features extracted from the tumor volume on contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images (CE-T1WI), were compared between aggressive and non-aggressive groups. Variables with significant differences were enrolled into Pearson's correlation analysis to weaken multicollinearity. Logistic regression models based on the selected features were constructed to predict tumor aggressiveness under fivefold cross-validation. Sixty-five imaging features, including five shape-related and sixty textural features, were extracted from volumetric CE-T1WI. Forty-seven features were significantly different between aggressive and non-aggressive groups (all p values < 0.05). After feature selection, four features (SHAPE_Sphericity, SHAPE_Compacity, DISCRETIZED_Q3, and DISCRETIZED_Kurtosis) were put into logistic regression analysis. Based on the combination of these features and Knosp grade, the model yielded an area under the curve value of 0.935, with a sensitivity of 94.4% and a specificity of 82.9%, to discriminate between aggressive and non-aggressive pituitary adenomas in the testing set. The radiomic model based on tumor shape and textural features study from CE-T1WI might potentially assist in the preoperative aggressiveness diagnosis of pituitary adenomas. • Pituitary adenomas with aggressive behavior exhibit rapid growth, resistance to conventional treatment, and early recurrence despite gross resection and may require multiline treatments. • Shape-related features and texture features based on CE-T1WI were significantly correlated with the Ki-67 labeling index, mitotic count, and p53 expression, and the proposed model achieved a favorable prediction of the aggressiveness of PAs with an AUC value of 0.935. • The prediction model might provide valuable guidance for individualized treatment in patients with PAs.",2464

The aim of this study was to investigate [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose ([18F]FDG) and [18F]FES PET/CT imaging for response prediction and monitoring of drug activity in patients with metastatic ER-positive breast cancer undergoing treatment with the selective estrogen receptor downregulator (SERD) rintodestrant. In this trial (NCT03455270), PET/CT imaging was performed at baseline ([18F]FDG and [18F]FES), during treatment and at time of progression (only [18F]FES). Visual, quantitative, and mutational analysis was performed to derive a heterogeneity score (HS) and assess tracer uptake in lesions, in relation to the mutation profile. The primary outcome was progression-free survival (PFS). The HS and PFS in the entire group did not correlate (n = 16, Spearman's rho, P = 0.06), but patients with a low HS (< 25.0%, n = 4) had a PFS of > 5 months whereas patients with no [18F]FES uptake (HS 100.0%, n = 3) had a PFS of < 2 months. [18F]FES uptake was not affected by estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1) mutations. On-treatment [18F]FES PET/CT scans showed no [18F]FES uptake in any of the baseline [18F]FES-positive lesions. At progression, [18F]FES uptake remained blocked in patients scanned ≤ 1-2 half-lives of rintodestrant whereas it restored in patients scanned ≥ 5 days after end of treatment. Absence of ER expression on [18F]FES PET is a predictor for no response to rintodestrant. [18F]FES uptake during treatment and at time of progression is useful to monitor the (reversible) effect of therapy and continued mode of action of SERDs.

Patients with spinal metastases who received SBRT in our hospital from July 2018 to April 2022 consecutively were enrolled. All patients underwent conventional MRI and DCE-MRI before treatment. Pain was assessed before treatment and in the third month after treatment, and the patients were divided into pain-response and no-pain-response groups. A multivariate logistic regression model was constructed to obtain the odds ratio and 95% confidence interval (CI) for each variable. C-index was used to evaluate the model's discrimination performance. Overall, 112 independent spinal lesions in 89 patients were included. There were 73 (65.2%) and 39 (34.8%) lesions in the pain-response and no-pain-response groups, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that the number of treated lesions, pretreatment pain score, Karnofsky performance status score, Bilsky grade, and the DCE-MRI quantitative parameter K Some imaging and clinical features correlated with post-SBRT pain response in patients with spinal metastases. The model based on these characteristics has a good predictive value and can provide valuable information for clinical decision-making. • SBRT can accurately irradiate spinal metastases with ablative doses. • Predicting the post-SBRT pain response has important clinical implications. • The prediction models established based on clinical and MRI features have good performance.",1627

A total of 181 patients with 184 renal lesions diagnosed by both CEUS and DCE-MRI were enrolled in the study, including 136 clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) and 48 non-clear cell renal cell carcinoma (non-ccRCC) tumors. All lesions were confirmed by histopathologic diagnosis after surgical resection. Interobserver agreement was estimated using a weighted kappa statistic. Diagnostic efficiency in evaluating ccRCC and non-ccRCC was compared between CEUS and DCE-MRI. The weighted kappa value for interobserver agreement was 0.746 to 0.884 for CEUS diagnosis and 0.764 to 0.895 for DCE-MRI diagnosis. Good diagnostic performance in differential diagnosis of ccRCC and non-ccRCC was displayed by both CEUS and DCE-MRI: sensitivity was 89.7% and 91.9%, respectively; specificity was 77.1% and 68.8%, respectively; and area under the receiver operating curve was 0.834 and 0.803, respectively. No statistically significant differences were present between the two methods (p = 0.54). Both CEUS and DCE-MRI imaging are effective for the differential diagnosis of ccRCC and non-ccRCC. Thus, CEUS could be an alternative to DCE-MRI as a first test for patients at risk of renal cancer, particularly where DCE-MRI cannot be carried out. • CEUS and DCE-MRI features can help differentiate ccRCC and non-ccRCC. • The differential diagnosis of ccRCC and non-ccRCC by CEUS is comparable to that of DCE-MRI. • Interobserver agreement is generally high using CEUS and DCE-MRI.",1742

A total of 89 patients with 90 pancreatic lesions (all confirmed by surgery or biopsy pathology) that manifested hypoenhancement on contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) were included in this study. Six peak enhancement patterns were proposed for differentiating hypovascular pancreatic lesions. CEUS qualitative and TIC-based quantitative parameters were analyzed, and each lesion was scored based on the statistically significant qualitative parameters to evaluate the diagnostic ability of CEUS for hypovascular solid pancreatic lesions. Qualitative parameters such as peak enhancement pattern II/III/IV, penetrating vessels, centripetal enhancement, and early washout were reliable indicators of malignant lesions, and lesions scored based on these qualitative parameters, with a score ≥ 2, were highly suspected to be malignant lesions. Pattern I had an accuracy of 83.33% for predicting mass-forming pancreatitis (MFP), pattern V had an accuracy of 96.67% for predicting solid pseudopapillary tumors of the pancreas (SPTP), and pattern VI had an accuracy of 81.11% for predicting neuroendocrine tumors/carcinomas (NETs/NECs). For quantitative analysis, nodule/pancreatic parenchyma echo intensity reduction ratio was significantly greater in malignant lesions. CEUS qualitative and TIC-based quantitative parameters have clinical value in distinguishing malignant from benign hypovascular pancreatic lesions. • Contrast-enhanced ultrasound helps clinicians assess patients with pancreatic lesions. • Six peak enhancement patterns are proposed for differentiating pancreatic hypovascular lesions. • Qualitative parameters such as peak enhancement pattern II/III/IV, penetrating vessels, centripetal enhancement, early washout, and quantitative parameter nodule/pancreatic parenchyma echo intensity reduction ratio were important characteristics to discriminate malignant from hypovascular benign lesions.",2085

A convolutional-neural-network-based AI model was trained and validated; the reliability of different CAD methods (concurrent read and AI-first read) were tested in an internal/external cohort. The diagnostic performance, consistency and efficiency of radiologists and AI-based CAD were compared. The training/validation/internal test sets included 650 (400/100/150) cases from one center; the external test included 100 cases (25/25/50) from three centers. For diagnosis accuracy, AI-based CAD methods showed no significant differences and were equivalent to the radiologists in the internal test (127/150 vs. 130/150 vs. 125/150 for reader 1; 127/150 vs.132/150 vs. 131/150 for reader 2; all p > 0.05), whereas in the external test, concurrent-read methods were superior/equal to AI-first read (87/100 vs. 71/100, p < 0.001, for reader 2; 79/100 vs. 69/100, p = 0.076, for reader 1) and better than/equal to radiologists (79/100 vs. 72/100, p = 0.039, for reader 1; 87/100 vs. 86/100, p = 1.000, for reader 2). Moreover, AI-first read/concurrent read improved consistency in both internal test (κ = 1.000, 0.830) and external test (κ = 0.958, 0.713) compared to radiologists (κ = 0.747, 0.600); AI-first read method (8.54 s/7.66 s) was faster than readers (92.72 s/89.54 s) and concurrent-read method (29.15 s/28.92 s), respectively. AI-based CAD could improve the consistency and efficiency for accurate diagnosis; the concurrent-read method could enhance the diagnostic capabilities of an inexperienced radiologist in unfamiliar situations. • For prostate cancer segmentation, the performance of multi-small Vnet displays optimal compared to small Vnet and Vnet (DSC",2030
36723725,Prediction of histologic types in solid lung lesions using preoperative contrast-enhanced CT.,European radiology,2023,"This study aimed to develop and validate a predicting model for the histologic classification of solid lung lesions based on preoperative contrast-enhanced CT. A primary dataset of 1012 patients from Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital (TMUCIH) was randomly divided into a development cohort (708) and an internal validation cohort (304). Patients from the Second Hospital of Shanxi Medical University (SHSMU) were set as an external validation cohort (212). Two clinical factors (age, gender) and twenty-one characteristics on contrast-enhanced CT were used to construct a multinomial multivariable logistic regression model for the classification of seven common histologic types of solid lung lesions. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was used to assess the diagnostic performance of the model in the development and validation cohorts, separately. Multivariable analysis showed that two clinical factors and twenty-one characteristics on contrast-enhanced CT were predictive in lung lesion histologic classification. The mean AUC of the proposed model for histologic classification was 0.95, 0.94, and 0.92 in the development, internal validation, and external validation cohort, respectively. When determining the malignancy of lung lesions based on histologic types, the mean AUC of the model was 0.88, 0.86, and 0.90 in three cohorts. We demonstrated that by utilizing both clinical and CT characteristics on contrast-enhanced CT images, the proposed model could not only effectively stratify histologic types of solid lung lesions, but also enabled accurate assessment of lung lesion malignancy. Such a model has the potential to avoid unnecessary surgery for patients and to guide clinical decision-making for preoperative treatment. • Clinical and CT characteristics on contrast-enhanced CT could be used to differentiate histologic types of solid lung lesions. • Predicting models using preoperative contrast-enhanced CT could accurately assessment of tumor malignancy based on predicted histologic types.",2063
36722763,PI-RR: The Prostate Imaging for Recurrence Reporting System for MRI Assessment of Local Prostate Cancer Recurrence After Radiation Therapy or Radical Prostatectomy-A Review.,AJR. American journal of roentgenology,2023,"The purpose of this article is to review clinical application of the Prostate Imaging for Recurrence Reporting (PI-RR) system. This system, released in 2021, represents international consensus-based guidelines for the acquisition, interpretation, and reporting of multiparametric MRI performed to detect locally recurrent prostate cancer after radiation therapy or radical prostatectomy. The system reduces variability through use of a standardized and structured reporting approach whereby the overall level of suspicion of recurrence is classified on a 5-point scale. The overall suspicion score is derived from 5-point scales for assessing DWI and dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) imaging. Separate scales for both DWI and DCE imaging are provided for evaluation after radiation therapy and after radical prostatectomy. These scales account for the relation between detected abnormalities and the location of the primary tumor on pretreatment imaging. T2-weighted imaging is also assessed on a 5-point scale and is useful for anatomic imaging but does not influence the overall score. Initial retrospective studies have shown promising results with respect to the reproducibility and accuracy of PI-RR in detecting locally recurrent tumor.",1241

36719495,Automatic segmentation and radiomic texture analysis for osteoporosis screening using chest low-dose computed tomography.,European radiology,2023,"This study developed a diagnostic tool combining machine learning (ML) segmentation and radiomic texture analysis (RTA) for bone density screening using chest low-dose computed tomography (LDCT). A total of 197 patients who underwent LDCT followed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry were analyzed. First, an autosegmentation model was trained using LDCT to delineate the thoracic vertebral body (VB). Second, a two-level classifier was developed using radiomic features extracted from VBs for the hierarchical pairwise classification of each patient's bone status. All the patients were initially classified as either normal or abnormal, and all patients with abnormal bone density were then subdivided into an osteopenia group and an osteoporosis group. The performance of the classifier was evaluated through fivefold cross-validation. The model for automated VB segmentation achieved a Sorenson-Dice coefficient of 0.87 ± 0.01. Furthermore, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve scores for the two-level classifier were 0.96 ± 0.01 for detecting abnormal bone density (accuracy = 0.91 ± 0.02; sensitivity = 0.93 ± 0.03; specificity = 0.89 ± 0.03) and 0.98 ± 0.01 for distinguishing osteoporosis (accuracy = 0.94 ± 0.02; sensitivity = 0.95 ± 0.03; specificity = 0.93 ± 0.03). The testing prediction accuracy levels for the first- and second-level classifiers were 0.92 ± 0.04 and 0.94 ± 0.05, respectively. The overall testing prediction accuracy of our method was 0.90 ± 0.05. The combination of ML segmentation and RTA for automated bone density prediction based on LDCT scans is a feasible approach that could be valuable for osteoporosis screening during lung cancer screening. • This study developed an automatic diagnostic tool combining machine learning-based segmentation and radiomic texture analysis for bone density screening using chest low-dose computed tomography. • The developed method enables opportunistic screening without quantitative computed tomography or a dedicated phantom. • The developed method could be integrated into the current clinical workflow and used as an adjunct for opportunistic screening or for patients who are ineligible for screening with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry.",2239
36719494,XGBoost-based multiparameters from dual-energy computed tomography for the differentiation of multiple myeloma of the spine from vertebral osteolytic metastases.,European radiology,2023,"To evaluate the performance of extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) combined with multiparameters from dual-energy computed tomography (mpDECT) to differentiate between multiple myeloma (MM) of the spine and vertebral osteolytic metastases (VOM). For this retrospective study, 28 patients (83 lesions) with MM of the spine and 23 patients (54 lesions) with VOM who underwent DECT were included. The mpDECT for each lesion, including normalized effective atomic number, slope of the spectral Hounsfield unit curve, CT attenuation, and virtual noncalcium (VNCa), was obtained. Boruta was used to select the key parameters, and then subsequently merged with XGBoost to yield a prediction model. The lesions were divided into the training and testing group in a 3:1 ratio. The highest performance of the univariate analysis was compared with XGBoost using the Delong test. The mpDECT of MM was significantly lower than that of VOM (all p < 0.05). In univariate analysis, VNCa had the highest area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) in the training group (0.81) and testing group (0.87). Based on Boruta, 6 parameters of DECT were selected for XGBoost model construction. The XGBoost model achieved an excellent and stable diagnostic performance, as shown in the training group (AUC of 1.0) and testing group (AUC of 0.97), with a sensitivity of 80%, a specificity of 95%, and an accuracy of 88%, which was superior to VNCa (p < 0.05). XGBoost combined with mpDECT yielded promising performance in differentiating between MM of the spine and VOM. • The multiparameters obtained from dual-energy CT of multiple myeloma differed significantly from those of vertebral osteolytic metastases. • The virtual noncalcium offered the highest AUC in the univariate analysis to distinguish multiple myeloma from vertebral osteolytic metastases. • Extreme gradient boosting combined with multiparameters from dual-energy CT had a promising performance to distinguish multiple myeloma from vertebral osteolytic metastases.",2024
36719493,Diagnostic performance of computed tomography features in detecting oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma extranodal extension.,European radiology,2023,"Accurate pre-treatment imaging determination of extranodal extension (ENE) could facilitate the selection of appropriate initial therapy for HPV-positive oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (HPV + OPSCC). Small studies have associated 7 CT features with ENE with varied results and agreement. This article seeks to determine the replicable diagnostic performance of these CT features for ENE. Five expert academic head/neck neuroradiologists from 5 institutions evaluate a single academic cancer center cohort of 75 consecutive HPV + OPSCC patients. In a web-based virtual laboratory for imaging research and education, the experts performed training on 7 published CT features associated with ENE and then independently identified the ""single most (if any) suspicious"" lymph node and presence/absence of each of the features. Inter-rater agreement was assessed using percentage agreement, Gwet's AC1, and Fleiss' kappa. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values were calculated for each CT feature based on histologic ENE. All 5 raters identified the same node in 52 cases (69%). In 15 cases (20%), at least one rater selected a node and at least one rater did not. In 8 cases (11%), all raters selected a node, but at least one rater selected a different node. Percentage agreement and Gwet's AC1 coefficients were > 0.80 for lesion identification, matted/conglomerated nodes, and central necrosis. Fleiss' kappa was always < 0.6. CT sensitivity for histologically confirmed ENE ranged 0.18-0.94, specificity 0.41-0.88, PPV 0.26-0.36, and NPV 0.78-0.96. Previously described CT features appear to have poor reproducibility among expert head/neck neuroradiologists and poor predictive value for histologic ENE. • Previously described CT imaging features appear to have poor reproducibility among expert head and neck subspecialized neuroradiologists as well as poor predictive value for histologic ENE. • Although it may still be appropriate to comment on the presence or absence of these CT features in imaging reports, the evidence indicates that caution is warranted when incorporating these features into clinical decision-making regarding the likelihood of ENE.",2197
36719291,Ablative Margins of Colorectal Liver Metastases Using Deformable CT Image Registration and Autosegmentation.,Radiology,2023,"Background Confirming ablation completeness with sufficient ablative margin is critical for local tumor control following colorectal liver metastasis (CLM) ablation. An image-based confirmation method considering patient- and ablation-related biomechanical deformation is an unmet need. Purpose To evaluate a biomechanical deformable image registration (DIR) method for three-dimensional (3D) minimal ablative margin (MAM) quantification and the association with local disease progression following CT-guided CLM ablation. Materials and Methods This single-institution retrospective study included patients with CLM treated with CT-guided microwave or radiofrequency ablation from October 2015 to March 2020. A biomechanical DIR method with AI-based autosegmentation of liver, tumors, and ablation zones on CT images was applied for MAM quantification retrospectively. The per-tumor incidence of local disease progression was defined as residual tumor or local tumor progression. Factors associated with local disease progression were evaluated using the multivariable Fine-Gray subdistribution hazard model. Local disease progression sites were spatially localized with the tissue at risk for tumor progression (<5 mm) using a 3D ray-tracing method. Results Overall, 213 ablated CLMs (mean diameter, 1.4 cm) in 124 consecutive patients (mean age, 57 years ± 12 [SD]; 69 women) were evaluated, with a median follow-up interval of 25.8 months. In ablated CLMs, an MAM of 0 mm was depicted in 14.6% (31 of 213), from greater than 0 to less than 5 mm in 40.4% (86 of 213), and greater than or equal to 5 mm in 45.1% (96 of 213). The 2-year cumulative incidence of local disease progression was 72% for 0 mm and 12% for greater than 0 to less than 5 mm. No local disease progression was observed for an MAM greater than or equal to 5 mm. Among 117 tumors with an MAM less than 5 mm, 36 had local disease progression and 30 were spatially localized within the tissue at risk for tumor progression. On multivariable analysis, an MAM of 0 mm (subdistribution hazard ratio, 23.3; 95% CI: 10.8, 50.5; ",2092

Preoperative MR including APTw imaging of 125 patients with RA (mean 61.4 ± 11.6 years) were retrospectively analyzed. Two radiologists reviewed each case's EMVI status based on the MR-based modified 5-point scale system with conventional MR images. The APTw histogram parameters of primary tumors were obtained automatically using whole-tumor volume histogram analysis. The independent risk factors markedly correlated with pEMVI-positive status were assessed using univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses. Diagnosis performance was assessed by receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis. The AUCs were compared using the Delong method. Univariate analysis demonstrated that MR-tumor (T) stage, MR-lymph node (N) stage, APTw-10%, APTw-90%, interquartile range, APTw-minimum, APTw-maximum, APTw-mean, APTw-median, entropy, kurtosis, mean absolute deviation (MAD), and robust MAD were significantly related to pEMVI-positive status (all p < 0.05). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that MR-T stage (OR = 4.864, p = 0.018), MR-N stage (OR = 4.967, p = 0.029), interquartile range (OR = 0.892, p = 0.037), APT-minimum (OR = 1.046, p = 0.031), entropy (OR = 11.604, p = 0.006), and kurtosis (OR = 1.505, p = 0.007) were the independent risk factors enabling prediction of pEMVI-positive status. The AUCs for diagnostic ability of conventional MRI assessment, the APTw histogram model, and the combined model (including APTw histogram and clinical variables) were 0.785, 0.853, and 0.918, respectively. The combined model outperformed the APTw histogram model (p = 0.013) and the conventional MRI assessment (p = 0.006). Whole-tumor histogram analysis of APTw images combined with clinical factors showed better diagnosis efficiency in predicting EMVI involvement in RA. • Rectal adenocarcinomas with pEMVI-positive status are typically associated with higher APTw-SI values. • APTw-minimum, interquartile range, entropy, kurtosis, MR-T stage, and MR-N stage are the independent risk factors for EMVI involvement. • The best prediction for EMVI involvement was obtained with a combined model of APTw histogram and clinical variables (area under the curve, 0.918).",2397
36695903,MRI-based two-stage deep learning model for automatic detection and segmentation of brain metastases.,European radiology,2023,"To develop and validate a two-stage deep learning model for automatic detection and segmentation of brain metastases (BMs) in MRI images. In this retrospective study, T1-weighted (T1) and T1-weighted contrast-enhanced (T1ce) MRI images of 649 patients who underwent radiotherapy from August 2019 to January 2022 were included. A total of 5163 metastases were manually annotated by neuroradiologists. A two-stage deep learning model was developed for automatic detection and segmentation of BMs, which consisted of a lightweight segmentation network for generating metastases proposals and a multi-scale classification network for false-positive suppression. Its performance was evaluated by sensitivity, precision, F1-score, dice, and relative volume difference (RVD). Six hundred forty-nine patients were randomly divided into training (n = 295), validation (n = 99), and testing (n = 255) sets. The proposed two-stage model achieved a sensitivity of 90% (1463/1632) and a precision of 56% (1463/2629) on the testing set, outperforming one-stage methods based on a single-shot detector, 3D U-Net, and nnU-Net, whose sensitivities were 78% (1276/1632), 79% (1290/1632), and 87% (1426/1632), and the precisions were 40% (1276/3222), 51% (1290/2507), and 53% (1426/2688), respectively. Particularly for BMs smaller than 5 mm, the proposed model achieved a sensitivity of 66% (116/177), far superior to one-stage models (21% (37/177), 36% (64/177), and 53% (93/177)). Furthermore, it also achieved high segmentation performance with an average dice of 81% and an average RVD of 20%.

We prospectively included patients with pathologically confirmed EC from November 2018 to June 2021, who had baseline stage of T3-4N0-2M0 and restaging after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. All patients underwent contrast-enhanced CT and MRI of the thorax. Two independent blinded radiologists scored image quality and the presence of invasion. Agreements between the two readers were calculated using kappa test. The sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive predict value (PPV), and negative predict value (NPV) of MRI and CT in evaluating invasion were calculated. The net reclassification index (NRI) was used to evaluate the change in the number of patients correctly classified by MRI and CT. A total of 70 patients (64.8 ± 9.0 years; 53 men) were enrolled. Inter-reader agreements of image quality scores and presence of invasion by MRI and CT between the two readers were almost perfect (kappa > 0.80). The accuracy of MRI in evaluating thoracic aorta invasion was significantly higher than that of CT (reader 1: 90.0% vs. 71.4%; reader 2: 92.9% vs. 70.0%, respectively), and the accuracy of MRI in evaluating tracheobronchial invasion also was significantly higher than that of CT (reader 1: 92.9% vs. 72.9%; reader 2: 95.7% vs. 70.0%, respectively). NRI values were positive in both the evaluation of aorta and tracheobronchial invasion. The accuracy of 3-T MRI in determining thoracic aorta and tracheobronchial invasion is significantly higher than that of CT. • 3.0-T MRI was significantly more accurate than CT in assessing invasion of the thoracic aorta in patients with esophageal cancer. • 3.0-T MRI was also significantly more accurate than CT in assessing tracheobronchial invasion in patients with esophageal cancer. • 3.0-T MRI has a higher diagnostic performance than CT in evaluating patients with suspected aortic or tracheobronchial invasion in esophageal cancer.",2032

Purpose To evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of dynamic contrast-enhanced abbreviated MRI for early-stage HCC detection, using surgical pathologic findings as the reference standard. Materials and Methods This retrospective study was conducted at three U.S. liver transplant centers in patients with cirrhosis who underwent liver resection or transplant between January 2009 and December 2019 and standard ""full"" liver MRI with and without contrast enhancement within 3 months before surgery. Patients who had HCC-directed treatment before surgery were excluded. Dynamic abbreviated MRI examinations were simulated from the presurgical full MRI by selecting the coronal T2-weighted and axial three-dimensional fat-suppressed T1-weighted dynamic contrast-enhanced sequences at precontrast, late arterial, portal venous, and delayed phases. Two abdominal radiologists at each center independently interpreted the simulated abbreviated examinations with use of the Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System version 2018. Patients with any high-risk liver observations (>LR-3) were classified as positive; otherwise, they were classified as negative. With liver pathologic findings as the reference standard for the presence versus absence of early-stage HCC, the sensitivity, specificity, and their 95% CIs were calculated. Logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with correct classification.

36690774,Automated prostate multi-regional segmentation in magnetic resonance using fully convolutional neural networks.,European radiology,2023,"Automatic MR imaging segmentation of the prostate provides relevant clinical benefits for prostate cancer evaluation such as calculation of automated PSA density and other critical imaging biomarkers. Further, automated T2-weighted image segmentation of central-transition zone (CZ-TZ), peripheral zone (PZ), and seminal vesicle (SV) can help to evaluate clinically significant cancer following the PI-RADS v2.1 guidelines. Therefore, the main objective of this work was to develop a robust and reproducible CNN-based automatic prostate multi-regional segmentation model using an intercontinental cohort of prostate MRI. A heterogeneous database of 243 T2-weighted prostate studies from 7 countries and 10 machines of 3 different vendors, with the CZ-TZ, PZ, and SV regions manually delineated by two experienced radiologists (ground truth), was used to train (n = 123) and test (n = 120) a U-Net-based model with deep supervision using a cyclical learning rate. The performance of the model was evaluated by means of dice similarity coefficient (DSC), among others. Segmentation results with a DSC above 0.7 were considered accurate. The proposed method obtained a DSC of 0.88 ± 0.01, 0.85 ± 0.02, 0.72 ± 0.02, and 0.72 ± 0.02 for the prostate gland, CZ-TZ, PZ, and SV respectively in the 120 studies of the test set when comparing the predicted segmentations with the ground truth. No statistically significant differences were found in the results obtained between manufacturers or continents. Prostate multi-regional T2-weighted MR images automatic segmentation can be accurately achieved by U-Net like CNN, generalizable in a highly variable clinical environment with different equipment, acquisition configurations, and population. • Deep learning techniques allows the accurate segmentation of the prostate in three different regions on MR T2w images. • Multi-centric database proved the generalization of the CNN model on different institutions across different continents. • CNN models can be used to aid on the diagnosis and follow-up of patients with prostate cancer.",2078

36648551,A retrospective preliminary study of intrapancreatic late enhancement as a noteworthy imaging finding in the early stages of pancreatic adenocarcinoma.,European radiology,2023,"To characterize intrapancreatic late enhancement (ILE) observed in the early stages of pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAC). Among 203 patients pathologically diagnosed with PAC between October 2011 and February 2021, 32 patients with pre-diagnostic abdominal contrast-enhanced CT performed from 6 months to 5 years before the diagnosis were enrolled in this study. Indirect findings (IFs) on pre-diagnostic CT, including ILE, were evaluated and examined for various clinical data and time intervals to diagnosis (TIDs). The detected ILE was quantitatively evaluated, and the effect of ILE awareness on lesion detection by two radiologists and their interobserver agreement were assessed. Among the 32 patients, 23 showed IFs. ILE was observed in 14 patients (63%), with a median TID of 17 months (interquartile ratio [IQR]: 9.3-42.3). ILE alone was observed in eight patients (35%), ILE with focal pancreatic parenchymal atrophy (FPPA) was observed in five patients (22%), and ILE with main pancreatic duct abnormalities (MPDA) was observed in one patient (4%). Pancreatic head lesions were significantly more frequent in patients with ILE alone than in patients with FPPA or MPDA (p = 0.026). The median long-axis diameters of the region with ILE and ILE-to-pancreas contrast were 10 (IQR: 5-11) mm and 24 (IQR: 17-33) HU, respectively. Awareness of ILE led observers to detect two or three more pancreatic head lesions, and interobserver agreement increased from poor agreement (k = 0.17) to moderate agreement (k = 0.55). ILE is a significant IF for early PAC detection. • Intrapancreatic late enhancement (ILE) is a significant indirect finding in the early detection of pancreatic adenocarcinoma. • ILE without other indirect findings is expected to help detect pancreatic head lesions. • Image evaluation focusing on ILE can increase lesion detection and improve the interobserver agreement.",1893

Patients with pathologically proven RCCs and benign renal tumors from our institution between 2008 and 2020 were included as the training dataset for ML model development and internal validation (including 418 RCCs and 78 benign tumors), and patients from two independent institutions and a public database (TCIA) were included as the external dataset for individual testing (including 262 RCCs and 47 benign tumors). Features were extracted from three-phase CT images. CatBoost was used for feature selection and ML model establishment. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was used to assess the performance of the ML model. The ML model based on 3D images performed better than that based on 2D images, with the highest AUC of 0.81 and accuracy (ACC) of 0.86. All three radiologists achieved better performance by referring to the classifier's decision, with accuracies increasing from 0.82 to 0.87, 0.82 to 0.88, and 0.76 to 0.87. The ML model achieved higher negative predictive values (NPV, 0.82-0.99), and the radiologists achieved higher positive predictive values (PPV, 0.91-0.95). A ML classifier based on whole-tumor three-phase CT images can be a useful and promising tool for differentiating RCCs from benign renal tumors. The ML model also perfectly complements radiologist interpretations. • A machine learning classifier based on CT images could be a reliable way to differentiate RCCs from benign renal tumors. • The machine learning model perfectly complemented the radiologists' interpretations. • Subtle variances in ROI delineation had little effect on the performance of the ML classifier.",1945
36640173,Validation of a semi-automatic method to measure total liver volumes in polycystic liver disease on computed tomography - high speed and accuracy.,European radiology,2023,"Polycystic liver disease (PLD) is characterized by growth of hepatic cysts, causing hepatomegaly. Disease severity is determined using total liver volume (TLV), which can be measured from computed tomography (CT). The gold standard is manual segmentation which is time-consuming and requires expert knowledge of the anatomy. This study aims to validate the commercially available semi-automatic MMWP (Multimodality Workplace) Volume tool for CT scans of PLD patients. We included adult patients with one (n = 60) or two (n = 46) abdominal CT scans. Semi-automatic contouring was compared with manual segmentation, using comparison of observed volumes (cross-sectional) and growth (longitudinal), correlation coefficients (CC), and Bland-Altman analyses with bias and precision, defined as the mean difference and SD from this difference. Inter- and intra-reader variability were assessed using coefficients of variation (CV) and we assessed the time to perform both procedures. Median TLV was 5292.2 mL (IQR 3141.4-7862.2 mL) at baseline. Cross-sectional analysis showed high correlation and low bias and precision between both methods (CC 0.998, bias 1.62%, precision 2.75%). Absolute volumes were slightly higher for semi-automatic segmentation (manual 5292.2 (3141.4-7862.2) versus semi-automatic 5432.8 (3071.9-7960.2) mL, difference 2.7%, p < 0.001). Longitudinal analysis demonstrated that semi-automatic segmentation accurately measures liver growth (CC 0.908, bias 0.23%, precision 4.04%). Inter- and intra-reader variability were small (2.19% and 0.66%) and comparable to manual segmentation (1.21% and 0.63%) (p = 0.26 and p = 0.37). Semi-automatic segmentation was faster than manual tracing (19 min versus 50 min, p = 0.009). Semi-automatic liver segmentation is a fast and accurate method to determine TLV and liver growth in PLD patients. • Semi-automatic liver segmentation using the commercially available MMWP volume tool accurately determines total liver volume as well as liver growth over time in polycystic liver disease patients. • This method is considerably faster than manual segmentation through the use of Hounsfield unit settings. • We used a real-life CT set for the validation and showed that the semi-automatic tool measures accurately regardless of contrast used for the CT scan or not, presence of polycystic kidneys, liver volume, and previous invasive treatment for polycystic liver disease.",2426
36637463,Sarcopenia assessed with DXA and CT increases the risk of perioperative complications in patients with gastrectomy.,European radiology,2023,"We investigated sarcopenia prevalence using various diagnostic criteria based on dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and computed tomography (CT) in gastric cancer patients who underwent gastrectomy, and evaluated the association between sarcopenia and perioperative complications. This retrospective study included consecutive patients with gastric cancer who underwent gastrectomy, and preoperative DXA and CT from January 2013 to November 2020. Body composition was measured using DXA and CT. Height-adjusted DXA-based Appendicular Skeletal Muscle Mass Index (ASMI) and CT-based skeletal muscle cross-sectional area at the L3 level (SMI) were measured. Sarcopenia and sarcopenic obesity were defined using reported cutoff values. The chi-square test and univariate analysis were performed to determine risk factors for significant and severe perioperative complications (Clavien-Dindo Grades ≥ 2 and ≥ 3, respectively). In total, 77 males and 43 females aged 61.4 ± 11.0 years were included. ASMI and SMI were correlated (r = 0.819), but sarcopenia prevalence varied (20.0-63.3%), depending on the criteria applied. Univariate analysis revealed sarcopenia defined using the Asian Working Group on Sarcopenia (AWGS) criteria and sarcopenic obesity as risk factors for significant (odds ratio [OR] 2.76, p = 0.030 vs. OR 4.31, p = 0.002) and severe perioperative complications (OR 3.77, p = 0.036 vs. OR 4.78, p = 0.010). In subgroup analyses, sarcopenia and sarcopenic obesity were significantly associated with perioperative complications only in males. Perioperative complication risk can be predicted from sarcopenia defined using the AWGS criteria and sarcopenic obesity measured using DXA and CT, particularly in males. • The prevalence of sarcopenia varies due to definition differences. • Sarcopenia and sarcopenic obesity are risk factors for significant and severe perioperative complications, particularly in males. • Our results suggest that physicians need to pay attention to perioperative complications after surgical treatment of male patients with sarcopenia and sarcopenic obesity.",2103

36634294,Sybil: A Validated Deep Learning Model to Predict Future Lung Cancer Risk From a Single Low-Dose Chest Computed Tomography.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,2023,"Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) for lung cancer screening is effective, although most eligible people are not being screened. Tools that provide personalized future cancer risk assessment could focus approaches toward those most likely to benefit. We hypothesized that a deep learning model assessing the entire volumetric LDCT data could be built to predict individual risk without requiring additional demographic or clinical data. We developed a model called Sybil using LDCTs from the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST). Sybil requires only one LDCT and does not require clinical data or radiologist annotations; it can run in real time in the background on a radiology reading station. Sybil was validated on three independent data sets: a heldout set of 6,282 LDCTs from NLST participants, 8,821 LDCTs from Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), and 12,280 LDCTs from Chang Gung Memorial Hospital (CGMH, which included people with a range of smoking history including nonsmokers). Sybil achieved area under the receiver-operator curves for lung cancer prediction at 1 year of 0.92 (95% CI, 0.88 to 0.95) on NLST, 0.86 (95% CI, 0.82 to 0.90) on MGH, and 0.94 (95% CI, 0.91 to 1.00) on CGMH external validation sets. Concordance indices over 6 years were 0.75 (95% CI, 0.72 to 0.78), 0.81 (95% CI, 0.77 to 0.85), and 0.80 (95% CI, 0.75 to 0.86) for NLST, MGH, and CGMH, respectively. Sybil can accurately predict an individual's future lung cancer risk from a single LDCT scan to further enable personalized screening. Future study is required to understand Sybil's clinical applications. Our model and annotations are publicly available. [Media: see text].",1666
36633877,Magnetic Resonance Imaging-Guided vs Computed Tomography-Guided Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy for Prostate Cancer: The MIRAGE Randomized Clinical Trial.,JAMA oncology,2023,"Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) guidance offers multiple theoretical advantages in the context of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) for prostate cancer. However, to our knowledge, these advantages have yet to be demonstrated in a randomized clinical trial. To determine whether aggressive margin reduction with MRI guidance significantly reduces acute grade 2 or greater genitourinary (GU) toxic effects after prostate SBRT compared with computed tomography (CT) guidance. This phase 3 randomized clinical trial (MRI-Guided Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy for Prostate Cancer [MIRAGE]) enrolled men aged 18 years or older who were receiving SBRT for clinically localized prostate adenocarcinoma at a single center between May 5, 2020, and October 1, 2021. Data were analyzed from January 15, 2021, through May 15, 2022. All patients had 3 months or more of follow-up. Patients were randomized 1:1 to SBRT with CT guidance (control arm) or MRI guidance. Planning margins of 4 mm (CT arm) and 2 mm (MRI arm) were used to deliver 40 Gy in 5 fractions. The primary end point was the incidence of acute (≤90 days after SBRT) grade 2 or greater GU toxic effects (using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.03 [CTCAE v4.03]). Secondary outcomes included CTCAE v4.03-based gastrointestinal toxic effects and International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS)-based and Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite-26 (EPIC-26)-based outcomes. Between May 2020 and October 2021, 156 patients were randomized: 77 to CT (median age, 71 years [IQR, 67-77 years]) and 79 to MRI (median age, 71 years [IQR, 68-75 years]). A prespecified interim futility analysis conducted after 100 patients reached 90 or more days after SBRT was performed October 1, 2021, with the sample size reestimated to 154 patients. Thus, the trial was closed to accrual early. The incidence of acute grade 2 or greater GU toxic effects was significantly lower with MRI vs CT guidance (24.4% [95% CI, 15.4%-35.4%] vs 43.4% [95% CI, 32.1%-55.3%]; P = .01), as was the incidence of acute grade 2 or greater gastrointestinal toxic effects (0.0% [95% CI, 0.0%-4.6%] vs 10.5% [95% CI, 4.7%-19.7%]; P = .003). Magnetic resonance imaging guidance was associated with a significantly smaller percentage of patients with a 15-point or greater increase in IPSS at 1 month (6.8% [5 of 72] vs 19.4% [14 of 74]; P = .01) and a significantly reduced percentage of patients with a clinically significant (≥12-point) decrease in EPIC-26 bowel scores (25.0% [17 of 68] vs 50.0% [34 of 68]; P = .001) at 1 month. In this randomized clinical trial, compared with CT-guidance, MRI-guided SBRT significantly reduced both moderate acute physician-scored toxic effects and decrements in patient-reported quality of life. Longer-term follow-up will confirm whether these notable benefits persist. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04384770.",2891

36625882,Automated lung cancer assessment on 18F-PET/CT using Retina U-Net and anatomical region segmentation.,European radiology,2023,"To develop and test a Retina U-Net algorithm for the detection of primary lung tumors and associated metastases of all stages on FDG-PET/CT. A data set consisting of 364 FDG-PET/CTs of patients with histologically confirmed lung cancer was used for algorithm development and internal testing. The data set comprised tumors of all stages. All lung tumors (T), lymphatic metastases (N), and distant metastases (M) were manually segmented as 3D volumes using whole-body PET/CT series. The data set was split into a training (n = 216), validation (n = 74), and internal test data set (n = 74). Detection performance for all lesion types at multiple classifier thresholds was evaluated and false-positive-findings-per-case (FP/c) calculated. Next, detected lesions were assigned to categories T, N, or M using an automated anatomical region segmentation. Furthermore, reasons for FPs were visually assessed and analyzed. Finally, performance was tested on 20 PET/CTs from another institution. Sensitivity for T lesions was 86.2% (95% CI: 77.2-92.7) at a FP/c of 2.0 on the internal test set. The anatomical correlate to most FPs was the physiological activity of bone marrow (16.8%). TNM categorization based on the anatomical region approach was correct in 94.3% of lesions. Performance on the external test set confirmed the good performance of the algorithm (overall detection rate = 88.8% (95% CI: 82.5-93.5%) and FP/c = 2.7). Retina U-Nets are a valuable tool for tumor detection tasks on PET/CT and can form the backbone of reading assistance tools in this field. FPs have anatomical correlates that can lead the way to further algorithm improvements. The code is publicly available. • Detection of malignant lesions in PET/CT with Retina U-Net is feasible. • All false-positive findings had anatomical correlates, physiological bone marrow activity being the most prevalent. • Retina U-Nets can build the backbone for tools assisting imaging professionals in lung tumor staging.",1980

36625746,Surveillance Imaging after Primary Diagnosis of Ductal Carcinoma in Situ.,Radiology,2023,"Background Guidelines recommend annual surveillance imaging after diagnosis of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). Guideline adherence has not been characterized in a contemporary cohort. Purpose To identify uptake and determinants of surveillance imaging in women who underwent treatment for DCIS. Materials and Methods A stratified random sample of women who underwent breast-conserving surgery for primary DCIS between 2008 and 2014 was retrospectively selected from 1330 facilities in the United States. Imaging examinations were recorded from date of diagnosis until first distant recurrence, death, loss to follow-up, or end of study (November 2018). Imaging after treatment was categorized into 10 12-month periods starting 6 months after diagnosis. Primary outcome was per-period receipt of asymptomatic surveillance imaging (mammography, MRI, or US). Secondary outcome was diagnosis of ipsilateral invasive breast cancer. Multivariable logistic regression with repeated measures and generalized estimating equations was used to model receipt of imaging. Rates of diagnosis with ipsilateral invasive breast cancer were compared between women who did and those who did not undergo imaging in the 6-18-month period after diagnosis using inverse probability-weighted Kaplan-Meier estimators. Results A total of 12 559 women (median age, 60 years; IQR, 52-69 years) were evaluated. Uptake of surveillance imaging was 75% in the first period and decreased over time (",1467

36622410,Clinical value of artificial intelligence in thyroid ultrasound: a prospective study from the real world.,European radiology,2023,"To evaluate the diagnostic performance of a commercial artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted ultrasonography (US) for thyroid nodules and to validate its value in real-world medical practice. From March 2021 to July 2021, 236 consecutive patients with 312 suspicious thyroid nodules were prospectively enrolled in this study. One experienced radiologist performed US examinations with a real-time AI system (S-Detect). US images and AI reports of the nodules were recorded. Nine residents and three senior radiologists were invited to make a ""benign"" or ""malignant"" diagnosis based on recorded US images without knowing the AI reports. After referring to AI reports, the diagnosis was made again. The diagnostic performance of AI, residents, and senior radiologists with and without AI reports were analyzed. The sensitivity, accuracy, and AUC of the AI system were 0.95, 0.84, and 0.753, respectively, and were not statistically different from those of the experienced radiologists, but were superior to those of the residents (all p < 0.01). The AI-assisted resident strategy significantly improved the accuracy and sensitivity for nodules ≤ 1.5 cm (all p < 0.01), while reducing the unnecessary biopsy rate by up to 27.7% for nodules > 1.5 cm (p = 0.034). The AI system achieved performance, for cancer diagnosis, comparable to that of an average senior thyroid radiologist. The AI-assisted strategy can significantly improve the overall diagnostic performance for less-experienced radiologists, while increasing the discovery of thyroid cancer ≤ 1.5 cm and reducing unnecessary biopsies for nodules > 1.5 cm in real-world medical practice. • The AI system reached a senior radiologist-like level in the evaluation of thyroid cancer and could significantly improve the overall diagnostic performance of residents. • The AI-assisted strategy significantly improved ≤ 1.5 cm thyroid cancer screening AUC, accuracy, and sensitivity of the residents, leading to an increased detection of thyroid cancer while maintaining a comparable specificity to that of radiologists alone. • The AI-assisted strategy significantly reduced the unnecessary biopsy rate for thyroid nodules > 1.5 cm by the residents, while maintaining a comparable sensitivity to that of radiologists alone.",2273

Familial CCM patients were enrolled in the longitudinal multicentre study Treat-CCM. The 3-T MRI scan allowed performing a semi-automatic segmentation of CCMs and computing the maximum susceptibility in each segmented CCM (QSMmax) at baseline. CCMs were classified as haemorrhagic and non-haemorrhagic at baseline and then subclassified according to the 1-year (t1) evolution. Between-group differences were tested, and the diagnostic accuracy of QSMmax in predicting the presence or absence of haemorrhagic signs in CCMs was calculated with ROC analyses. Thirty-three patients were included in the analysis, and a total of 1126 CCMs were segmented. QSMmax was higher in haemorrhagic CCMs than in non-haemorrhagic CCMs (p < 0.001). In haemorrhagic CCMs at baseline, the accuracy of QSMmax in differentiating CCMs that were still haemorrhagic from CCMs that recovered from haemorrhage at t1 calculated as area under the curve (AUC) was 0.78 with sensitivity 62.69%, specificity 82.35%, positive predictive value (PPV) 93.3% and negative predictive value (NPV) 35.9% (QSMmax cut-off ≥ 1462.95 ppb). In non-haemorrhagic CCMs at baseline, AUC was 0.91 in differentiating CCMs that bled at t1 from stable CCMs with sensitivity 100%, specificity 81.9%, PPV 5.1%, and NPV 100% (QSMmax cut-off ≥ 776.29 ppb). The QSMmax in CCMs at baseline showed high accuracy in predicting the presence or absence of haemorrhagic signs at 1-year follow-up. Further effort is required to test the role of QSM in follow-up assessment and therapeutic trials in multicentre CCM studies. • QSM in semi-automatically segmented CCM was feasible. • The maximum magnetic susceptibility in a single CCM at baseline may predict the presence or absence of haemorrhagic signs at 1-year follow-up. • Multicentric studies are needed to enforce the role of QSM in predicting the CCMs' haemorrhagic evolution in patients affected by familial and sporadic forms.",2122

The clinical, pathological, and HRCT imaging data of 457 patients (from bicentric) with pathologically confirmed stage IA IAC (459 lesions in total) were retrospectively analyzed. The 459 lesions were classified into high-grade pattern (HGP) (n = 101) and non-high-grade pattern (n-HGP) (n = 358) groups depending on the presence of HGP (micropapillary and solid) in pathological results. The clinical and pathological data contained age, gender, smoking history, tumor stage, pathological type, and presence or absence of tumor spread through air spaces (STAS). CT features consisted of lesion location, size, density, shape, spiculation, lobulation, vacuole, air bronchogram, and pleural indentation. The independent predictors for HGP were screened by univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses. The clinical, CT, and clinical-CT models were constructed according to the multivariable analysis results. The multivariate analysis suggested the independent predictors of HGP, encompassing tumor size (p = 0.001; OR = 1.090, 95% CI 1.035-1.148), density (p < 0.001; OR = 9.454, 95% CI 4.911-18.199), and lobulation (p = 0.002; OR = 2.722, 95% CI 1.438-5.154).

In total, 5708 benign (n = 4597) and malignant (n = 1111) thyroid nodules were collected from 5081 consecutive patients treated in 26 institutions. Seventeen experienced radiologists evaluated nodule characteristics on ultrasonographic images. Eight predictive models were used to stratify the thyroid nodules according to malignancy risk; model performance was assessed via nested 10-fold cross-validation. The best-performing algorithm was externally validated using data for 454 thyroid nodules from a tertiary hospital, then compared to the Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System (TIRADS)-based interpretations of radiologists (American College of Radiology, European and Korean TIRADS, and AACE/ACE/AME guidelines). The area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curves of the algorithms ranged from 0.773 to 0.862. The sensitivities, specificities, positive predictive values, and negative predictive values of the best-performing models were 74.1-76.6%, 80.9-83.4%, 49.2-51.9%, and 93.0-93.5%, respectively. For the external validation set, the ElasticNet values were 83.2%, 89.2%, 81.8%, and 90.1%, respectively. The corresponding TIRADS values were 66.5-85.0%, 61.3-80.8%, 45.9-72.1%, and 81.5-90.3%, respectively. The new model exhibited a significantly higher AUROC and specificity than did the TIRADS risk stratification, although its sensitivity was similar. We developed a reliable machine learning-based predictive model that demonstrated enhanced specificity when stratifying thyroid nodules according to malignancy risk. This system will contribute to improved personalized management of thyroid nodules. • The area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve, sensitivity, and specificity of our model were 0.914, 83.2%, and 89.2%, respectively (derived using the validation dataset). • Compared to the TIRADS values, the AUROC and specificity are significantly higher, while the sensitivity is similar. • An interactive version of our AI algorithm is at http://tirads.cdss.co.kr .",2238

EMBRACE-I was a prospective, observational, multicenter cohort study on magnetic resonance imaging-based image-guided adaptive brachytherapy (MR-IGABT) in locally advanced cervical cancer. Treatment consisted of external beam radiotherapy, concurrent chemotherapy, and MR-IGABT. LF was defined as progressive or recurrent disease in the cervix, uterus, parametria, pelvic wall, or vagina. Competing risk analysis was used to estimate local tumor control (LC) and Cox proportional regression models for multivariable analysis and dose-response analysis. One thousand three hundred eighteen patients with a median follow-up of 52 months were available for this analysis. Eighty-one patients had persistent disease 3 months after end of treatment. Of those, 60 patients achieved LC at 6-9 months without further treatment, whereas 21 patients had progressive disease. In addition, 77 patients developed a local recurrence after complete remission comprising a total number of 98 LFs. LFs were located inside the MR-IGABT target volumes in 90% of patients with LF. In multivariable analysis, histology, minimal dose to 90% of high-risk clinical target volume (CTV The present study demonstrates the safety and validity of the GYN GEC-ESTRO/ICRU-89 target concept and provides large-scale evidence for dose prescription and new risk factors for LF in MR-IGABT in locally advanced cervical cancer.",1539
36594873,Stimulated Raman Scattering Microscopy Enables Gleason Scoring of Prostate Core Needle Biopsy by a Convolutional Neural Network.,Cancer research,2023,"Focal therapy (FT) has been proposed as an approach to eradicate clinically significant prostate cancer while preserving the normal surrounding tissues to minimize treatment-related toxicity. Rapid histology of core needle biopsies is essential to ensure the precise FT for localized lesions and to determine tumor grades. However, it is difficult to achieve both high accuracy and speed with currently available histopathology methods. Here, we demonstrated that stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) microscopy could reveal the largely heterogeneous histologic features of fresh prostatic biopsy tissues in a label-free and near real-time manner. A diagnostic convolutional neural network (CNN) built based on images from 61 patients could classify Gleason patterns of prostate cancer with an accuracy of 85.7%. An additional 22 independent cases introduced as external test dataset validated the CNN performance with 84.4% accuracy. Gleason scores of core needle biopsies from 21 cases were calculated using the deep learning SRS system and showed a 71% diagnostic consistency with grading from three pathologists. This study demonstrates the potential of a deep learning-assisted SRS platform in evaluating the tumor grade of prostate cancer, which could help simplify the diagnostic workflow and provide timely histopathology compatible with FT treatment. A platform combining stimulated Raman scattering microscopy and a convolutional neural network provides rapid histopathology and automated Gleason scoring on fresh prostate core needle biopsies without complex tissue processing.",1585

All patients underwent pre- and post-neoadjuvant RT MRI examinations from which whole-tumor texture features were extracted, including T Five of 30 patients (16.7%) achieved pCR. The Delta_Model (AUC 0.92) had a better predictive ability than the Pre_Model (AUC 0.78) and Post_Model (AUC 0.76) and was better than AJCC staging (AUC 0.52) and RECIST 1.1 criteria (AUC 0.52). The Combined_Model (pre, post, and delta features) had the best predictive performance (AUC 0.95). Whole-tumor texture analysis of multisequence MRI can well predict pCR status after neoadjuvant RT and targeted therapy in STS patients, with better performance than RECIST 1.1 and AJCC staging. • MRI multisequence texture analysis could predict the efficacy of neoadjuvant RT and targeted therapy for STS patients. • Texture features showed incremental value beyond routine clinical factors. • The Combined_Model with features at multiple time points showed the best performance.",1268
36576549,Comparison of MRI response evaluation methods in rectal cancer: a multicentre and multireader validation study.,European radiology,2023,"To compare four previously published methods for rectal tumor response evaluation after chemoradiotherapy on MRI. Twenty-two radiologists (5 rectal MRI experts, 17 general/abdominal radiologists) retrospectively reviewed the post-chemoradiotherapy MRIs of 90 patients, scanned at 10 centers (with non-standardized protocols). They applied four response methods; two based on T2W-MRI only (MRI tumor regression grade (mrTRG); split-scar sign), and two based on T2W-MRI+DWI (modified-mrTRG; DWI-patterns). Image quality was graded using a 0-6-point score (including slice thickness and in-plane resolution; sequence angulation; DWI b-values, signal-to-noise, and artefacts); scores < 4 were classified below average. Mixed model linear regression was used to calculate average sensitivity/specificity/accuracy to predict a complete response (versus residual tumor) and assess the impact of reader experience and image quality. Group interobserver agreement (IOA) was calculated using Krippendorff's alpha. Readers were asked to indicate their preferred scoring method(s). Average sensitivity/specificity/accuracy was 57%/64%/62% (mrTRG), 36%/79%/66% (split-scar), 40%/79%/67% (modified-mrTRG), and 37%/82%/68% (DWI-patterns); mrTRG showed higher sensitivity but lower specificity and accuracy (p < 0.001) compared to the other methods. IOA was lower for the split scar method (0.18 vs. 0.39-0.43). Higher reader experience had a significant positive effect on diagnostic performance and IOA (except for the split scar sign); below-average imaging quality had a significant negative effect on diagnostic performance. DWI pattern was selected as the preferred method by 73% of readers. Methods incorporating DWI showed the most favorable results when combining diagnostic performance, IOA, and reader preference. Reader experience and image quality clearly impacted diagnostic performance emphasizing the need for state-of-the-art imaging and dedicated radiologist training. • In a multireader study comparing 4 MRI methods for rectal tumor response evaluation, those incorporating DWI showed the best results when combining diagnostic performance, IOA, and reader preference. • The most preferred method (by 73% of readers) was the ""DWI patterns"" approach with an accuracy of 68%, high specificity of 82%, and group IOA of 0.43. • Reader experience level and MRI quality had an evident effect on diagnostic performance and IOA.",2424

We aimed to investigate the effectiveness of low-contrast-dose CT using dual-energy CT and deep learning-based denoising (DLD) techniques in patients at high risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We performed a prospective, randomized controlled noninferiority trial at a tertiary hospital between June 2019 and August 2020 (NCT04027556). Patients at high risk of HCC were randomly assigned (1:1) to the standard-contrast-dose group or low-contrast-dose group, which targeted a 40% reduction in contrast medium dose based on lean body weight. HCC conspicuity on arterial phase images was the primary endpoint with a noninferiority margin of 0.2. Images were independently assessed by three radiologists; model-based iterative reconstruction (MBIR) images of the standard-contrast-dose group and low monoenergetic (50-keV) DLD images of the low-contrast-dose group were compared using a generalized estimating equation. Ninety participants (age 59 ± 10 years; 68 men) were analyzed. Compared with the standard-contrast-dose group (n = 47), 40% less contrast media was used in the low-contrast-dose group (n = 43) (107.0 ± 17.1 mL vs. 64.5 ± 11.3 mL, p < 0.001). In the arterial phase, HCC conspicuity on 50-keV DLD images in the low-contrast-dose group was noninferior to that of MBIR images in the standard-contrast-dose group (2.92 vs. 2.56; difference, 0.36; 95% confidence interval, -0.13 to ∞; p = 0.013). The contrast dose in liver CT can be reduced by 40% without impairing HCC conspicuity when using 50-keV and DLD techniques. • In the arterial phase, hepatocellular carcinoma conspicuity on 50-keV deep learning-based denoising images in the low-contrast-dose group was noninferior to that of model-based iterative reconstruction images in the standard-contrast-dose group. • HCC detection was comparable between 50-keV deep learning-based denoising images in the low-contrast-dose group and model-based iterative reconstruction images in the standard-contrast-dose group.",2092
36576544,Diffusion-weighted imaging and arterial spin labeling radiomics features may improve differentiation between radiation-induced brain injury and glioma recurrence.,European radiology,2023,"To determine whether radiomics features derived from diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and arterial spin labeling (ASL) can improve the differentiation between radiation-induced brain injury (RIBI) and tumor recurrence (TR) in glioma patients. A total of 4199 radiomics features were extracted from conventional MRI, apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), and cerebral blood flow (CBF) maps, obtained from 96 pathologically confirmed WHO grade 2~4 gliomas with enhancement after standard treatment. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was used to test segmentation stability between two doctors. Radiomics features were selected using the Mann-Whitney U test, LASSO regression, and RFE algorithms. Four machine learning classifiers were adopted to establish radiomics models. The diagnostic performance of multiparameter, conventional, and single-parameter MRI radiomics models was compared using the area under the curve (AUC). The models were evaluated in the subsequent independent validation set (n = 30). Eight important radiomics features (3 from conventional MRI, 1 from ADC, and 4 from CBF) were selected. Support vector machine (SVM) was chosen as the optimal classifier. The diagnostic performance of the multiparameter MRI radiomics model (AUC 0.96) was higher than that of the conventional MRI (AUC 0.88), ADC (AUC 0.91), and CBF (AUC 0.95) radiomics models. For subgroup analysis, the multiparameter MRI radiomics model showed similar performance, with AUCs of 0.98 in WHO grade 2~3 and 0.96 in WHO grade 4. The incorporation of noninvasive DWI and ASL into the MRI radiomics model improved the diagnostic performance in differentiating RIBI from TR; ASL, especially, played a significant role. • The multiparameter MRI radiomics model was superior to the conventional MRI radiomics model in differentiating glioma recurrence from radiation-induced brain injury. • Diffusion and perfusion MRI could improve the ability of the radiomics model in predicting the progression in patients with glioma. • Arterial spin labeling played an important role in predicting glioma progression using radiomics models.",2123

36571602,Fully automatic volume measurement of the adrenal gland on CT using deep learning to classify adrenal hyperplasia.,European radiology,2023,"To develop a fully automated deep learning model for adrenal segmentation and to evaluate its performance in classifying adrenal hyperplasia. This retrospective study evaluated automated adrenal segmentation in 308 abdominal CT scans from 48 patients with adrenal hyperplasia and 260 patients with normal glands from 2010 to 2021 (mean age, 42 years; 156 women). The dataset was split into training, validation, and test sets at a ratio of 6:2:2. Contrast-enhanced CT images and manually drawn adrenal gland masks were used to develop a U-Net-based segmentation model. Predicted adrenal volumes were obtained by fivefold splitting of the dataset without overlapping the test set. Adrenal volumes and anthropometric parameters (height, weight, and sex) were utilized to develop an algorithm to classify adrenal hyperplasia, using multilayer perceptron, support vector classification, a random forest classifier, and a decision tree classifier. To measure the performance of the developed model, the dice coefficient and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) were used for segmentation, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were used for classification. The model for segmenting adrenal glands achieved a Dice coefficient of 0.7009 for 308 cases and an ICC of 0.91 (95% CI, 0.90-0.93) for adrenal volume. The models for classifying hyperplasia had the following results: AUC, 0.98-0.99; accuracy, 0.948-0.961; sensitivity, 0.750-0.813; and specificity, 0.973-1.000.

Imaging data of 71 patients with suspect malignancies who underwent total-body 2-[ A total of 390 lesions were found in the thorax and upper abdomen. Lesion detectability was significantly higher in gated-15 (97.2%) than in ungated-15 (93.6%, p = 0.001) and ungated-5 (92.3%, p = 0.001), but comparable to Gated-6 (95.9%, p = 0.993). A total of 131 lesions were selected for quantitative analyses. Lesions in Gated-15 presented significantly larger standardized uptake values, tumor-to-liver ratio, and tumor-to-blood ratio, but smaller metabolic tumor volume, compared to those in Ungated-15 and Ungated-5 (all p < 0.001). These differences were more obvious in small lesions and in lesions from sites other than mediastinum/retroperitoneum. However, these indices were not significantly different between Gated-15 and Gated-6. Higher, but acceptable, image noise was identified in gated images than in ungated images. Respiratory-gating imaging with reduced scanning time using the total-body PET/CT scanner is superior to ungated imaging and can be used in the clinic. • In PET imaging, respiratory gating can improve lesion presentation and detectability but requires longer imaging time. • This single-center study showed that the total-body PET scanner allows respiratory-gated imaging with reduced and clinically acceptable scanning time.",1541
36565351,CT-based preoperative risk assessment of prolonged urine leak in patients undergoing partial nephrectomy.,European radiology,2023,"This study aims to evaluate risk factors of prolonged urine leak following partial nephrectomy (PN) to identify objective imaging characteristics on preoperative CT. A total of 865 patients who underwent PN and had preoperative CT and postoperative imaging were included. We set a twofold size-matched control group without urine leak, with all tumors located ≤ 4 mm to the collecting system to identify imaging parameters that increase the risk of urine leak other than tumor size and location. Four CT parameters that show the relationship of the tumor and collecting system, namely, curvilinear border length, protruding distance, margin at the interface, and pelvicalyceal contact, were analyzed. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to identify significant predictors of urine leak. The diagnostic performance of the significant parameters was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Fifty-three of 865 patients (6.1%) demonstrated urine leak. Compared with the control group, urine leak group showed longer curvilinear border length, longer protruding distance, frequent non-smooth contact interface, and frequent direct pelvicalyceal contact (p < 0.05 for all). In the multivariate analysis, pelvicalyceal contact was the independent predictor of urine leak (OR = 2.62; 95% C.I 1.02-6.63). Combining four CT parameters, an AUC of 0.70 with a sensitivity of 58.5% and a specificity of 79.2% for identifying urine leak after PN could be obtained. The four CT features that describe the relationship between the tumor and collecting system might be useful for evaluating the risk of urine leak before PN. • Four CT parameters (curvilinear border length, protruding distance, margin at the interface, and pelvicalyceal contact) were significantly associated with postoperative urine leak after partial nephrectomy. • A comprehensive preoperative imaging evaluation of the relationship between the tumor and renal sinus may help in selecting the optimal surgical options and afford better patient counseling of complication risk.",2093

A total of 129 consecutive patients (age, 58.8 ± 11.4 years; male, 71.3%) underwent gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI using a modified injection protocol for HCC evaluation from July 2017 to February 2018. The modified injection protocol consisted of routine dynamic imaging (6 mL) and SSAP imaging (4 mL). Two radiologists independently reviewed two AMRI sets: AMRI without SSAP (surveillance set) and AMRI with SSAP (diagnosis set). A modified version of the Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System (LI-RADS) for the diagnosis set was devised by referring to contrast-enhanced ultrasound LI-RADS. Sixty-seven patients with HCC and 62 patients without HCC were included. In the surveillance set, sensitivity and specificity for the detection of patients with HCC were 95.5% and 96.8%, and 94.0% and 96.8% in reviewers 1 and 2, respectively. In the diagnosis set, the scores of most HCCs (76/78, 97.4%) were consistent between LI-RADS of full-protocol and modified LI-RADS of AMRI with SSAP protocol. When the HCC surveillance and diagnosis strategy was changed from strategy 1 (AMRI without SSAP) to strategy 2 (AMRI with SSAP), the recall rate significantly decreased from 52.7 to 3.9% (p < 0.001). The modified LI-RADS score of the AMRI with SSAP protocol showed high agreement with the LI-RADS score of the full protocol. The HCC surveillance and diagnosis strategy using the AMRI with SSAP protocol reduced the recall rate. These results may enable to diagnose HCC simultaneously with surveillance. • A modified version of LI-RADS was devised for the diagnostic algorithm using AMRI with the second shot arterial phase (SSAP) by referring to CEUS LI-RADS. • The modified LI-RADS scores using AMRI with SSAP showed a high concordance rate with the conventional LI-RADS score using full-protocol MRI. • The recall rate significantly decreased when the HCC surveillance and diagnosis strategy was changed from strategy 1 (AMRI without SSAP; surveillance then recall test) to strategy 2 (AMRI with SSAP; simultaneous surveillance and diagnosis).",2179
36547676,Development and validation of a [,European radiology,2023,"In this study, based on PET/CT radiomics features, we developed and validated a nomogram to predict progression-free survival (PFS) for cases with diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) treated with immunochemotherapy. This study retrospectively recruited 129 cases with DLBCL. Among them, PET/CT scans were conducted and baseline images were collected for radiomics features along with their clinicopathological features. Radiomics features related to recurrence were screened for survival analysis using univariate Cox regression analysis with p < 0.05. Next, a weighted Radiomics-score (Rad-score) was generated and independent risk factors were obtained from univariate and multivariate Cox regressions to build the nomogram. Furthermore, the nomogram was tested for their ability to predict PFS using time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, calibration curves, and decision curve analysis (DCA). Blood platelet, Rad-score, and gender were included in the nomogram as independent DLBCL risk factors for PFS. We found that the training cohort areas under the curve (AUCs) were 0.79, 0.84, and 0.88, and validation cohort AUCs were 0.67, 0.83, and 0.72, respectively. Further, the DCA and calibration curves confirmed the predictive nomogram's clinical relevance. Using Rad-score, blood platelet, and gender of the DLBCL patients, a PET/CT radiomics-based nomogram was developed to guide cases' recurrence risk assessment prior to treatment. The developed nomogram can help provide more appropriate treatment plans to the cases. • DLBCL cases can be classified into low- and high-risk groups using PET/CT radiomics based Rad-score. • When combined with other clinical characteristics (gender and blood platelet count), Rad-score can be used to predict the outcome of the pretreatment of DLBCL cases with a certain degree of accuracy. • A prognostic nomogram was established in this study in order to aid in assessing prognostic risk and providing more accurate treatment plans for DLBCL cases.",2017
36547673,Prediction of the characteristics of aggressiveness of pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms (PanNENs) based on CT radiomic features.,European radiology,2023,"To predict tumor grade (G1 vs. G2/3), presence of distant metastasis (M+), metastatic lymph nodes (N+), and microvascular invasion (VI) of pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms (PanNEN) based on preoperative CT radiomic features (RFs), by applying a machine learning approach aimed to limit overfit. This retrospective study included 101 patients who underwent surgery for PanNEN; the entire population was split into training (n = 70) and validation cohort (n = 31). Based on a previously validated methodology, after tumor segmentation on contrast-enhanced CT, RFs were extracted from unenhanced CT images. In addition, conventional radiological and clinical features were combined with RFs into multivariate logistic regression models using minimum redundancy and a bootstrap-based machine learning approach. For each endpoint, models were trained and validated including only RFs (RF_model), and both (radiomic and clinicoradiological) features (COMB_model). Twenty-five patients had G2/G3 tumor, 37 N+, and 14 M+ and 38 were shown to have VI. From a total of 182 RFs initially extracted, few independent radiomic and clinicoradiological features were identified. For M+ and G, the resulting models showed moderate to high performances: areas under the curve (AUC) for training/validation cohorts were 0.85/0.77 (RF_model) and 0.81/0.81 (COMB_model) for M+ and 0.67/0.72 and 0.68/0.70 for G. Concerning N+ and VI, only the COMB_model could be built, with poorer performance for N+ (AUC = 0.72/0.61) compared to VI (0.82/0.75). For all endpoints, the negative predictive value was good (≥ 0.75). Combining few radiomic and clinicoradiological features resulted in presurgical prediction of histological characteristics of PanNENs. Despite the limited risk of overfit, external validations are warranted. • Histology is the only tool currently available allowing characterization of PanNEN biological characteristics important for prognostic assessment; significant limitations to this approach exist. • Based upon preoperative contrast-enhanced CT images, a machine learning approach optimized to favor models' generalizability was successfully applied to train predictive models for tumor grading (G1 vs. G2/3), microvascular invasion, metastatic lymph nodes, and distant metastatic spread. • Moderate to high discriminative models (AUC: 0.67-0.85) based on few parameters (≤ 3) showing high negative predictive value (0.75-0.98) were generated and then successfully validated.",2479

In this multicenter, retrospective study, we reviewed 251 mRCC patients who received anti-PD1 from five centers. We analyzed the relationship between BMI, skeletal muscle area (SM), subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT), visceral adipose tissue (VAT), and subcutaneous adipose percentage (SAT%) with progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). The spatial localization T cells was investigated by multiplex immunofluorescence. Among 224 evaluable patients, 23 (10.3%) patients were underweight, 118 (52.7%) had normal weight, 65 (29%) were overweight, and 18 patients (8%) were obese. The median age was 55 years and most patients were male (71%). No significant improvement in PFS (HR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.27-1.42) or OS (HR, 1.09; 95% CI, 0.38-3.13) was observed for the obese patients. Besides, SM, VAT, and SAT were not associated with survival outcomes (all p > 0.05). Interestingly, SAT% independently predicted PFS (as continuous variable, HR: 0.02; 95% CI, 0.01-0.11) and OS (HR:0.05; 95% CI, 0.01-0.39), which remained significant in multivariate modeling (as continuous variable, adjusted HR for PFS, 0.01; 95% CI, 0.00-0.04; adjusted HR for OS, 0.08; 95% CI, 0.01-0.72). These associations were consistent in subgroup analysis of different gender, BMI, PD-L1 positive, and sarcopenia group.

36538071,Quantitative CT analysis of lung parenchyma to improve malignancy risk estimation in incidental pulmonary nodules.,European radiology,2023,"To assess the value of quantitative computed tomography (QCT) of the whole lung and nodule-bearing lobe regarding pulmonary nodule malignancy risk estimation. A total of 251 subjects (median [IQR] age, 65 (57-73) years; 37% females) with pulmonary nodules on non-enhanced thin-section CT were retrospectively included. Twenty percent of the nodules were malignant, the remainder benign either histologically or at least 1-year follow-up. CT scans were subjected to in-house software, computing parameters such as mean lung density (MLD) or peripheral emphysema index (pEI). QCT variable selection was performed using logistic regression; selected variables were integrated into the Mayo Clinic and the parsimonious Brock Model. Whole-lung analysis revealed differences between benign vs. malignant nodule groups in several parameters, e.g. the MLD (-766 vs. -790 HU) or the pEI (40.1 vs. 44.7 %). The proposed QCT model had an area-under-the-curve (AUC) of 0.69 (95%-CI, 0.62-0.76) based on all available data. After integrating MLD and pEI into the Mayo Clinic and Brock Model, the AUC of both clinical models improved (AUC, 0.91 to 0.93 and 0.88 to 0.91, respectively). The lobe-specific analysis revealed that the nodule-bearing lobes had less emphysema than the rest of the lung regarding benign (EI, 0.5 vs. 0.7 %; p < 0.001) and malignant nodules (EI, 1.2 vs. 1.7 %; p = 0.001). Nodules in subjects with higher whole-lung metrics of emphysema and less fibrosis are more likely to be malignant; hereby the nodule-bearing lobes have less emphysema. QCT variables could improve the risk assessment of incidental pulmonary nodules. • Nodules in subjects with higher whole-lung metrics of emphysema and less fibrosis are more likely to be malignant. • The nodule-bearing lobes have less emphysema compared to the rest of the lung. • QCT variables could improve the risk assessment of incidental pulmonary nodules.",1914

Adnexal lesions can be stratified into the Ovarian-Adnexal Reporting and Data System (O-RADS) risk of malignancy categories with either the O-RADS lexicon, proposed by the American College of Radiology, or the International Ovarian Tumor Analysis (IOTA) 2-step strategy. To investigate the diagnostic performance of the O-RADS lexicon and the IOTA 2-step strategy. Retrospective external diagnostic validation study based on interim data of IOTA5, a prospective international multicenter cohort study, in 36 oncology referral centers or other types of centers. A total of 8519 consecutive adult patients presenting with an adnexal mass between January 1, 2012, and March 1, 2015, and treated either with surgery or conservatively were included in this diagnostic study. Twenty-five patients were excluded for withdrawal of consent, 2777 were excluded from 19 centers that did not meet predefined data quality criteria, and 812 were excluded because they were already in follow-up at recruitment. The analysis included 4905 patients with a newly detected adnexal mass in 17 centers that met predefined data quality criteria. Data were analyzed from January 31 to March 1, 2022. Stratification into O-RADS categories (malignancy risk <1%, 1% to <10%, 10% to <50%, and ≥50%). For the IOTA 2-step strategy, the stratification is based on the individual risk of malignancy calculated with the IOTA 2-step strategy. Observed prevalence of malignancy in each O-RADS risk category, as well as sensitivity and specificity. The reference standard was the status of the tumor at inclusion, determined by histology or clinical and ultrasonographic follow-up for 1 year. Multiple imputation was used for uncertain outcomes owing to inconclusive follow-up information. Median age of the 4905 patients was 48 years (IQR, 36-62 years). Data on race and ethnicity were not collected. A total of 3441 tumors (70%) were benign, 978 (20%) were malignant, and 486 (10%) had uncertain classification. Using the O-RADS lexicon resulted in 1.1% (24 of 2196) observed prevalence of malignancy in O-RADS 2, 4% (34 of 857) in O-RADS 3, 27% (246 of 904) in O-RADS 4, and 78% (732 of 939) in O-RADS 5; the corresponding results for the IOTA 2-step strategy were 0.9% (18 of 1984), 4% (58 of 1304), 30% (206 of 690), and 82% (756 of 927). At the 10% risk threshold (O-RADS 4-5), the O-RADS lexicon had 92% sensitivity (95% CI, 87%-96%) and 80% specificity (95% CI, 74%-85%), and the IOTA 2-step strategy had 91% sensitivity (95% CI, 84%-95%) and 85% specificity (95% CI, 80%-88%). The findings of this external diagnostic validation study suggest that both the O-RADS lexicon and the IOTA 2-step strategy can be used to stratify patients into risk groups. However, the observed malignancy rate in O-RADS 2 was not clearly below 1%.",2866

Imaging data from consecutive adult patients with diffuse lower-grade gliomas (LGGs, histological grades 2-3) in Beijing Tiantan Hospital (December 1, 2013, to October 31, 2021, BTH set, n = 711) and the Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA) LGGs set (n = 117) were used to develop and validate our findings. Two independent observers assessed the SWITW sign and some well-reported discriminative radiological features to establish a practical diagnostic strategy. The SWITW sign showed satisfying sensitivity (0.684 and 0.722 for BTH and TCIA sets) and specificity (0.938 and 0.914 for BTH and TCIA sets) in defining IDHmut-Codels, and the interobserver agreement was substantial (κ 0.718 and 0.756 for BTH and TCIA sets). Compared to calcification, the SWITW sign improved the sensitivity by 0.28 (0.404 to 0.684) in the BTH set, and 81.0% (277/342) of IDHmut-Codel cases demonstrated SWITW and/ or calcification positivity. Combining the SWITW sign, calcification, low ADC values, and other discriminative features, we established a concise and reliable diagnostic protocol for IDHmut-Codels. The SWITW sign was a sensitive and specific imaging biomarker for IDHmut-Codels. The integrated protocol provided an explicable, efficient, and reproducible method for precise preoperative diagnosis, which was essential to guide individualized surgical plan-making. • The SWITW sign was a sensitive and specific imaging biomarker for IDHmut-Codel oligodendrogliomas. • The SWITW sign was more sensitive than calcification and an integrated strategy could improve diagnostic sensitivity for IDHmut-Codel oligodendrogliomas. • Combining SWITW, calcification, low ADC values, and other discriminative features could make a precise preoperative diagnosis for IDHmut-Codel oligodendrogliomas.",2160

36515714,A pre-treatment CT-based weighted radiomic approach combined with clinical characteristics to predict durable clinical benefits of immunotherapy in advanced lung cancer.,European radiology,2023,"To develop a pre-treatment CT-based predictive model to anticipate inoperable lung cancer patients' progression-free survival (PFS) to immunotherapy. This single-center retrospective study developed and cross-validated a radiomic model in 185 patients and tested it in 48 patients. The binary endpoint is the durable clinical benefit (DCB, PFS ≥ 6 months) and non-DCB (NDCB, PFS < 6 months). Radiomic features were extracted from multiple intrapulmonary lesions and weighted by an attention-based multiple-instance learning model. Aggregated features were then selected through L2-regularized ridge regression. Five machine-learning classifiers were conducted to build predictive models using radiomic and clinical features alone and then together. Lastly, the predictive value of the model with the best performance was validated by Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. The predictive models based on the weighted radiomic approach showed superior performance across all classifiers (AUCs: 0.75-0.82) compared with the largest lesion approach (AUCs: 0.70-0.78) and the average sum approach (AUCs: 0.64-0.80). Among them, the logistic regression model yielded the most balanced performance (AUC = 0.87 [95%CI 0.84-0.89], 0.75 [0.68-0.82], 0.80 [0.68-0.92] in the training, validation, and test cohort respectively).

A total of 470 patients with EOCs were included retrospectively. Patients were divided into a training dataset (N = 329) and a test dataset (N = 141). A total of 1316 radiomics features were extracted from the portal venous phase of contrast-enhanced CT images for each patient, followed by dimension reduction of the features. The support vector machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbor (KNN), random forest (RF), naïve Bayes (NB), logistic regression (LR), and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) classifiers were trained to obtain the radiomics signatures. The performance of each radiomics signature was evaluated and compared by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and relative standard deviation (RSD).

36512633,A Genetically Encoded Magnetic Resonance Imaging Reporter Enables Sensitive Detection and Tracking of Spontaneous Metastases in Deep Tissues.,Cancer research,2023,"Metastasis is the leading cause of cancer-related death. However, it remains a poorly understood aspect of cancer biology, and most preclinical cancer studies do not examine metastasis, focusing solely on the primary tumor. One major factor contributing to this paradox is a gap in available tools for accurate spatiotemporal measurements of metastatic spread in vivo. Here, our objective was to develop an imaging reporter system that offers sensitive three-dimensional (3D) detection of cancer cells at high resolutions in live mice. An organic anion-transporting polypeptide 1b3 (oatp1b3) was used as an MRI reporter gene, and its sensitivity was systematically optimized for in vivo tracking of viable cancer cells in a spontaneous metastasis model. Metastases with oatp1b3-MRI could be observed at the single lymph node level and tracked over time as cancer cells spread to multiple lymph nodes and different organ systems in individual animals. While initial single lesions were successfully imaged in parallel via bioluminescence, later metastases were largely obscured by light scatter from the initial node. Importantly, MRI could detect micrometastases in lung tissue comprised on the order of 1,000 cancer cells. In summary, oatp1b3-MRI enables longitudinal tracking of cancer cells with combined high resolution and high sensitivity that provides 3D spatial information and the surrounding anatomical context. An MRI reporter gene system optimized for tracking metastasis in deep tissues at high resolutions and able to detect spontaneous micrometastases in lungs of mice provides a useful tool for metastasis research.",1631

Literature on inter- and intra - observer agreement of MUL measurement is limited. We studied the inter- and intra-observer agreement between radiologists using a well-defined method to measure the MUL on the prostate MRI. Prostate cancer patients underwent a preoperative MRI and robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) at one high-volume RARP center. MUL measurement was based on well-defined landmarks on sagittal T2-weighted (anatomical) images. Three radiologists independently performed MUL measurements retrospectively in 106 patients blinded to themselves, to each other, and to clinical outcomes. The inter- and intra-observer agreement of MUL measurement between the radiologists were calculated, expressed as intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC). The initial inter-observer agreement was ICC 0.63; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.28-0.81. Radiologist 3 measured the MUL mean 3.9 mm (SD 3.3) longer than the other readers, interpreting the caudal point of the MUL (penile base) differently. After discussion on the correct anatomical definition, radiologist 3 re-assessed all scans, which resulted in a high inter-observer agreement (ICC 0.84; 95% CI 0.66-0.91). After a subsequent reading by radiologists 1 and 2, the intra-observer agreements were ICC 0.93; 95% CI 0.89-0.96, and ICC 0.98; 95% CI 0.97-0.98, respectively. Limitation is the monocenter design. The MUL can be measured reliably with high agreement among radiologists. • After discussion on the correct anatomical definition, the inter- and intra - observer agreements of membranous urethral length (MUL) measurement on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were high. • A reproducible method to measure the MUL can improve the clinical usefulness of prediction models for urinary continence after RARP which may benefit patient counselling.",2063

The Third Xiangya Hospital of Central South University provided the training set and internal test set, while Yueyang Central Hospital and Hunan Cancer Hospital provided the external test sets. Radiomic features were extracted and used to develop a radiomics model with machine learning in the training set, and the performance was verified in the two test sets. The outcomes cohort, including 58 adult patients with advanced HCC undergoing transarterial chemoembolization and antiangiogenic therapy, was used to evaluate the predictive value of the radiomics model for progression-free survival (PFS). Bulk RNA sequencing of tumors from 41 patients in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and single-cell RNA sequencing from seven prospectively enrolled participants were used to investigate the radiomics-related immune infiltration patterns. Area under the receiver operating characteristics curve of the radiomics model was calculated, and Cox proportional regression was performed to identify predictors of PFS. Results Among 365 patients (mean age, 55 years ± 10 [SD]; 319 men) used for radiomics modeling, 122 (33%) were confirmed to have the MTM subtype. The radiomics model included 11 radiomic features and showed good performance for predicting the MTM subtype, with AUCs of 0.84, 0.80, and 0.74 in the training set, internal test set, and external test set, respectively. A low radiomics model score relative to the median value in the outcomes cohort was independently associated with PFS (hazard ratio, 0.4; 95% CI: 0.2, 0.8; ",2211
36511804,Regional Histopathology and Prostate MRI Positivity: A Secondary Analysis of the PROMIS Trial.,Radiology,2023,"Background The effects of regional histopathologic changes on prostate MRI scans have not been accurately quantified in men with an elevated prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level and no previous biopsy. Purpose To assess how Gleason grade, maximum cancer core length (MCCL), inflammation, prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN), or atypical small acinar proliferation within a Barzell zone affects the odds of MRI visibility. Materials and Methods In this secondary analysis of the Prostate MRI Imaging Study (PROMIS; May 2012 to November 2015), consecutive participants who underwent multiparametric MRI followed by a combined biopsy, including 5-mm transperineal mapping (TPM), were evaluated. TPM pathologic findings were reported at the whole-prostate level and for each of 20 Barzell zones per prostate. An expert panel blinded to the pathologic findings reviewed MRI scans and declared which Barzell areas spanned Likert score 3-5 lesions. The relationship of Gleason grade and MCCL to zonal MRI outcome (visible vs nonvisible) was assessed using generalized linear mixed-effects models with random intercepts for individual participants. Inflammation, PIN, and atypical small acinar proliferation were similarly assessed in men who had negative TPM results. Results Overall, 161 men (median age, 62 years [IQR, 11 years]) were evaluated and 3179 Barzell zones were assigned MRI status. Compared with benign areas, the odds of MRI visibility were higher when a zone contained cancer with a Gleason score of 3+4 (odds ratio [OR], 3.1; 95% CI: 1.9, 4.9; ",1561
36502618,Staging of newly diagnosed Ewing sarcoma: Results of bone marrow aspiration and biopsy versus (18)FDG-PET/CT imaging for bone marrow involvement.,"European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",2023,"Ewing sarcoma (ES) is an aggressive bone or extraosseous tumour with an unfavourable prognosis when bone marrow metastases are present at diagnosis. The gold standard diagnosis for bone marrow (BM) involvement is cytological and pathological analysis through bone marrow aspiration and biopsy (BMAB). Several recent studies suggest that these invasive and painful procedures could be replaced by 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography/computed tomography ((18)FDG-PET/CT), as this nuclear imaging technique is highly sensitive at detecting bone and extraosseous metastases of ES. In order to study the precision of (18)FDG-PET/CT in the evaluation of bone marrow metastases at diagnosis, we compared the imaging results with cytological/histological analyses performed on BM samples. We retrospectively studied 180 patients with ES recorded at the Léon Bérard Centre over the past 10 years, who were evaluated by (18)FDG-PET/CT and BMAB at diagnosis. Of the 180 patients, 13 displayed marrow metastases by cytological/histological examination, and only one of these did not have (18)FDG-PET/CT signs of bone marrow involvement, whereas the 167 remaining patients without marrow metastasis all had a negative (18)FDG-PET/CT, except for one. Hence, the sensitivity and specificity of (18)FDG-PET/CT in these patients was 92.3% and 99.4%, respectively. The overall survival at five years of all patients was 67.4% but decrease to 38.5% in the group with bone marrow metastases. Given the results presented herein the bone sarcoma group of the French Sarcoma Group suggests that invasive BMAB no longer be systematically performed for the staging at the diagnosis of ES.",1679
36502461,Value of T2-weighted-based radiomics model in distinguishing Warthin tumor from pleomorphic adenoma of the parotid.,European radiology,2023,"The differentiation of Warthin tumor and pleomorphic adenoma before treatment is crucial for clinical strategies. The aim of this study was to develop and test a T2-weighted-based radiomics model for differentiating pleomorphic adenoma from Warthin tumor of the parotid gland. A total of 117 patients, including 61 cases of Warthin tumor and 56 cases of pleomorphic adenoma, were retrospectively enrolled from two centers between January 2010 and June 2022. The training set included 82 cases, and the validation set included 35 cases. From T2-weighted images, 971 radiomics features were extracted. Seven radiomics features remained after a two-step selection process. We used the seven radiomics features and clinical factors through multivariable logistic regression to build radiomics and clinical models, respectively. A radiomics-clinical model was also built that combined the independent clinical predictors with the radiomics features. Through ROC curves, the three models were evaluated and compared. In the radiomics model, AUCs were 0.826 and 0.796 in training and validation sets, respectively. In the clinical model, the AUCs were 0.923 and 0.926 in the training and validation sets, respectively. Decision curve analysis revealed that the radiomics-clinical model had the best diagnostic performance for distinguishing Warthin tumor from pleomorphic adenoma of the parotid gland (AUC = 0.962 and 0.934 for the training and validation sets, respectively). The radiomics-clinical model performed well in differentiating pleomorphic adenoma from Warthin tumor of the parotid gland. • The clinical model outperformed the radiomics model in distinguishing pleomorphic adenoma from Warthin tumor of the parotid gland. • The radiomics features extracted from T2-weighted images could help differentiate pleomorphic adenoma from Warthin tumor of the parotid gland. • The radiomics-clinical model was superior to the radiomics and the clinical models for differentiating pleomorphic adenoma from Warthin tumor of the parotid gland.",2037
36502459,Breast cancer screening with digital breast tomosynthesis: comparison of different reading strategies implementing artificial intelligence.,European radiology,2023,"Digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) can detect more cancers than the current standard breast screening method, digital mammography (DM); however, it can substantially increase the reading workload and thus hinder implementation in screening. Artificial intelligence (AI) might be a solution. The aim of this study was to retrospectively test different ways of using AI in a screening workflow. An AI system was used to analyse 14,772 double-read single-view DBT examinations from a screening trial with paired DM double reading. Three scenarios were studied: if AI can identify normal cases that can be excluded from human reading; if AI can replace the second reader; if AI can replace both readers. The number of detected cancers and false positives was compared with DM or DBT double reading. By excluding normal cases and only reading 50.5% (7460/14,772) of all examinations, 95% (121/127) of the DBT double reading detected cancers could be detected. Compared to DM screening, 27% (26/95) more cancers could be detected (p < 0.001) while keeping recall rates at the same level. With AI replacing the second reader, 95% (120/127) of the DBT double reading detected cancers could be detected-26% (25/95) more than DM screening (p < 0.001)-while increasing recall rates by 53%. AI alone with DBT has a sensitivity similar to DM double reading (p = 0.689). AI can open up possibilities for implementing DBT screening and detecting more cancers with the total reading workload unchanged. Considering the potential legal and psychological implications, replacing the second reader with AI would probably be most the feasible approach. • Breast cancer screening with digital breast tomosynthesis and artificial intelligence can detect more cancers than mammography screening without increasing screen-reading workload. • Artificial intelligence can either exclude low-risk cases from double reading or replace the second reader. • Retrospective study based on paired mammography and digital breast tomosynthesis screening data.",2024

Oncology,2023,"The European EPI-CT study aims to quantify cancer risks from CT examinations of children and young adults. Here, we assess the risk of brain cancer. We pooled data from nine European countries for this cohort study. Eligible participants had at least one CT examination before age 22 years documented between 1977 and 2014, had no previous diagnosis of cancer or benign brain tumour, and were alive and cancer-free at least 5 years after the first CT. Participants were identified through the Radiology Information System in 276 hospitals. Participants were linked with national or regional registries of cancer and vital status, and eligible cases were patients with brain cancers according to WHO International Classification of Diseases for Oncology. Gliomas were analysed separately to all brain cancers. Organ doses were reconstructed using historical machine settings and a large sample of CT images. Excess relative risks (ERRs) of brain cancer per 100 mGy of cumulative brain dose were calculated with linear dose-response modelling. The outcome was the first reported diagnosis of brain cancer after an exclusion period of 5 years after the first electronically recorded CT examination. We identified 948 174 individuals, of whom 658 752 (69%) were eligible for our study. 368 721 (56%) of 658 752 participants were male and 290 031 (44%) were female. During a median follow-up of 5·6 years (IQR 2·4-10·1), 165 brain cancers occurred, including 121 (73%) gliomas. Mean cumulative brain dose, lagged by 5 years, was 47·4 mGy (SD 60·9) among all individuals and 76·0 mGy (100·1) among people with brain cancer. A significant linear dose-response relationship was observed for all brain cancers (ERR per 100 mGy 1·27 [95% CI 0·51-2·69]) and for gliomas separately (ERR per 100 mGy 1·11 [0·36-2·59]). Results were robust when the start of follow-up was delayed beyond 5 years and when participants with possibly previously unreported cancers were excluded. The observed significant dose-response relationship between CT-related radiation exposure and brain cancer in this large, multicentre study with individual dose evaluation emphasises careful justification of paediatric CTs and use of doses as low as reasonably possible.

We conducted a mono-center retrospective study in a grade A tertiary hospital in China. Consecutive patients with suspected HCC from February 2019 to December 2020 were eligible for inclusion. All consenting patients underwent CEUS examination and were histologically diagnosed. Based on the clinical and US features between the two groups, we developed a binary logistic regression model and a nomogram for predicting MTM-HCC. A total of 161 patients (median age, 57 years; interquartile range, 48-64 years; 129 men) were included in the analysis. Twenty-seven of the HCCs (16.8%) were of the MTM subtype. Binary logistic regression analysis indicated that PVP hypoenhancement (OR = 15.497; 95% CI: 1.369, 175.451; p = 0.027), AFP > 454.6 ng/mL (OR = 8.658; 95% CI: 3.030, 24.741; p < 0.001), ALB ≤ 29.9 g/L (OR = 3.937; 95% CI: 1.017, 15.234; p = 0.047), halo sign (OR = 3.868; 95% CI: 1.314, 11.391; p = 0.016), and intratumoral artery (OR = 2.928; 95% CI: 1.039, 8.255; p = 0.042) were predictors for MTM subtype. Combining any two criteria showed a high sensitivity (100.0%); combining all five criteria showed a high specificity (99.2%); and the AUC value of the logistic regression model was 0.88 (95% CI: 0.81, 0.92). BMUS and CEUS could be used for identifying patients suspected of having MTM-HCC. Combining clinical information, BMUS, and CEUS features could achieve a noninvasive diagnosis of MTM-HCC. • Contrast-enhanced ultrasound examination helps clinicians to identify MTM-HCCs preoperatively. • PVP hypoenhancement, high AFP levels, low ALB levels, halo signs, and intratumoral arteries could be used to predict MTM-HCCs. • A logistic regression model and nomogram were built to noninvasively diagnose MTM-HCCs with an AUC value of 0.88 (95% CI: 0.81, 0.92).",1975

36480027,Improving the efficiency of identifying malignant pulmonary nodules before surgery via a combination of artificial intelligence CT image recognition and serum autoantibodies.,European radiology,2023,"To construct a new pulmonary nodule diagnostic model with high diagnostic efficiency, non-invasive and simple to measure. This study included 424 patients with radioactive pulmonary nodules who underwent preoperative 7-autoantibody (7-AAB) panel testing, CT-based AI diagnosis, and pathological diagnosis by surgical resection. The patients were randomly divided into a training set (n = 212) and a validation set (n = 212). The nomogram was developed through forward stepwise logistic regression based on the predictive factors identified by univariate and multivariate analyses in the training set and was verified internally in the verification set. A diagnostic nomogram was constructed based on the statistically significant variables of age as well as CT-based AI diagnostic, 7-AAB panel, and CEA test results. In the validation set, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and AUC were 82.29%, 90.48%, 97.24%, and 0.899 (95%[CI], 0.851-0.936), respectively. The nomogram showed significantly higher sensitivity than the 7-AAB panel test result (82.29% vs. 35.88%, p < 0.001) and CEA (82.29% vs. 18.82%, p < 0.001); it also had a significantly higher specificity than AI diagnosis (90.48% vs. 69.04%, p = 0.022).

36474057,Background enhancement in contrast-enhanced spectral mammography (CESM): are there qualitative and quantitative differences between imaging systems?,European radiology,2023,"To evaluate the impact of the digital mammography imaging system on overall background enhancement on recombined contrast-enhanced spectral mammography (CESM) images, the overall background enhancement of two different mammography systems was compared. In a retrospective single-center study, CESM images of n = 129 female patients who underwent CESM between 2016 and 2019 were analyzed independently by two radiologists. Two mammography machines of different manufacturers were compared qualitatively using a Likert-scale from 1 (minimal) to 4 (marked overall background enhancement) and quantitatively by placing a region of interest and measuring the intensity enhancement. Lesion conspicuity was analyzed using a Likert-scale from 1 (lesion not reliably distinguishable) to 5 (excellent lesion conspicuity). A multivariate regression was performed to test for potential biases on the quantitative results. Significant differences in qualitative background enhancement measurements between machines A and B were observed for both readers (p = 0.003 and p < 0.001). The quantitative evaluation showed significant differences in background enhancement with an average difference of 75.69 (99%-CI [74.37, 77.02]; p < 0.001). Lesion conspicuity was better for machine A for the first and second reader respectively (p = 0.009 and p < 0.001). The factor machine was the only influencing factor (p < 0.001). The factors contrast agent, breast density, age, and menstrual cycle could be excluded as potential biases. Mammography machines seem to significantly influence overall background enhancement qualitatively and quantitatively; thus, an impact on diagnostic accuracy appears possible. • Overall background enhancement on CESM differs between different vendors qualitatively and quantitatively. • Our retrospective single-center study showed consistent results of the qualitative and quantitative data analysis of overall background enhancement. • Lesion conspicuity is higher in cases of lower background enhancement on CESM.",2028
36472702,Diffusion-weighted MRI with deep learning for visualizing treatment results of MR-guided HIFU ablation of uterine fibroids.,European radiology,2023,"No method is available to determine the non-perfused volume (NPV) repeatedly during magnetic resonance-guided high-intensity focused ultrasound (MR-HIFU) ablations of uterine fibroids, as repeated acquisition of contrast-enhanced T1-weighted (CE-T1w) scans is inhibited by safety concerns. The objective of this study was to develop and test a deep learning-based method for translation of diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) into synthetic CE-T1w scans, for monitoring MR-HIFU treatment progression. The algorithm was retrospectively trained and validated on data from 33 and 20 patients respectively who underwent an MR-HIFU treatment of uterine fibroids between June 2017 and January 2019. Postablation synthetic CE-T1w images were generated by a deep learning network trained on paired DWI and reference CE-T1w scans acquired during the treatment procedure. Quantitative analysis included calculation of the Dice coefficient of NPVs delineated on synthetic and reference CE-T1w scans. Four MR-HIFU radiologists assessed the outcome of MR-HIFU treatments and NPV ratio based on the synthetic and reference CE-T1w scans. Dice coefficient of NPVs was 71% (± 22%). The mean difference in NPV ratio was 1.4% (± 22%) and not statistically significant (p = 0.79). Absolute agreement of the radiologists on technical treatment success on synthetic and reference CE-T1w scans was 83%. NPV ratio estimations on synthetic and reference CE-T1w scans were not significantly different (p = 0.27). Deep learning-based synthetic CE-T1w scans derived from intraprocedural DWI allow gadolinium-free visualization of the predicted NPV, and can potentially be used for repeated gadolinium-free monitoring of treatment progression during MR-HIFU therapy for uterine fibroids. • Synthetic CE-T1w scans can be derived from diffusion-weighted imaging using deep learning. • Synthetic CE-T1w scans may be used for visualization of the NPV without using a contrast agent directly after MR-HIFU ablations of uterine fibroids.",1999

This study aimed to assess the diagnostic accuracy of the Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System (LI-RADS) for subcentimeter HCC and to determine whether new diagnostic criteria (washout either on portal venous phase (PVP) or transitional phase (TP)) would improve the diagnostic performance. We evaluated 240 subcentimeter observations in 225 consecutive treatment-naïve patients at risk of HCC. Final diagnoses were 132 HCCs (all by pathology) and 108 non-HCC (41 by pathology and 67 by follow-up). Two radiologists assessed MR imaging features and assigned LI-RADS categories. A variety of diagnostic criteria were developed by combining significant MRI features based on washout on PVP or TP. Diagnostic performance was compared. Non-rim arterial phase hyperenhancement (non-rim APHE), washout on PVP or TP, and hepatobiliary-phase hypointensity were significant predictors for subcentimeter HCC diagnosis according to multivariable analysis. One criterion (non-rim APHE and washout on PVP or TP) yielded higher sensitivity (68.2% vs. 56.8%, p = 0.011) with comparable specificity (91.7% vs. 92.6%, p > 0.999) compared to the LR-4 category. This criterion had improved sensitivity (68.2% vs. 49.2%, p < 0.001) and slightly decreased specificity (91.7% vs. 94.4%, p = 0.250) compared to non-rim APHE with washout on PVP. LI-RADS exhibits modest diagnostic performance for subcentimeter HCC. Our new criterion (non-rim APHE and non-peripheral washout on PVP or TP) may increase the diagnostic sensitivity without compromised specificity compared to the LR-4 category. • The LR-4 category shows modest diagnostic performance for the diagnosis of subcentimeter HCC on EOB-MRI with a sensitivity and specificity of 56.8% and 92.6%, respectively. • Non-rim APHE, non-peripheral washout on PVP or TP, and HBP hypointensity were independent predictors for the diagnosis of subcentimeter HCC. • The combination of non-rim APHE and non-peripheral washout on PVP or TP improves the sensitivity from 56.8 to 68.2% (p = 0.011) with comparable specificity (91.7 vs. 92.6%, p > 0.999).",2206
36472538,Emerging and Evolving Concepts in Cancer Immunotherapy Imaging.,Radiology,2023,"Criteria based on measurements of lesion diameter at CT have guided treatment with historical therapies due to the strong association between tumor size and survival. Clinical experience with immune checkpoint modulators shows that editing immune system function can be effective in various solid tumors. Equally, novel immune-related phenomena accompany this novel therapeutic paradigm. These effects of immunotherapy challenge the association of tumor size with response or progression and include risks and adverse events that present new demands for imaging to guide treatment decisions. Emerging and evolving approaches to immunotherapy highlight further key issues for imaging evaluation, such as dissociated response following local administration of immune checkpoint modulators, pseudoprogression due to immune infiltration in the tumor environment, and premature death due to hyperprogression. Research that may offer tools for radiologists to meet these challenges is reviewed. Different modalities are discussed, including immuno-PET, as well as new applications of CT, MRI, and fluorodeoxyglucose PET, such as radiomics and imaging of hematopoietic tissues or anthropometric characteristics.

Radiomic features, as defined in our previously published radiomics model, were extracted from the primary tumor volumes of 157 OPSCC patients in a different institute. The developed radiomics model was validated using this cohort. Additionally, parameters influencing performance, such as patient subgroups, MRI acquisition, and post-processing steps on prediction performance will be investigated. For this analysis, matched subgroups (based on human papillomavirus (HPV) status of the tumor, T-stage, and tumor subsite) and a subgroup with only patients with 4-mm slice thickness were studied. Also the influence of harmonization techniques (ComBat harmonization, quantile normalization) and the impact of feature stability across observers and centers were studied. Model performances were assessed by area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity. Performance of the published model (AUC/sensitivity/specificity: 0.74/0.75/0.60) drops when applied on the validation cohort (AUC/sensitivity/specificity: 0.64/0.68/0.60). The performance of the full validation cohort improves slightly when the model is validated using a patient group with comparable HPV status of the tumor (AUC/sensitivity/specificity: 0.68/0.74/0.60), using patients acquired with a slice thickness of 4 mm (AUC/sensitivity/specificity: 0.67/0.73/0.57), or when quantile harmonization was performed (AUC/sensitivity/specificity: 0.66/0.69/0.60).

36455167,Reassessing the Benefits and Harms of Risk-Reducing Medication Considering the Persistent Risk of Breast Cancer Mortality in Estrogen Receptor-Positive Breast Cancer.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,2023,"Recent studies, including a meta-analysis of 88 trials, have shown higher than expected rates of recurrence and death in hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. These new findings suggest a need to re-evaluate the use of risk-reducing medication to avoid invasive breast cancer and breast cancer death in high-risk women. We adapted an established Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network model to evaluate the lifetime benefits and harms of risk-reducing medication in women with a ≥ 3% 5-year risk of developing breast cancer according to the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium risk calculator. Model input parameters were derived from meta-analyses, clinical trials, and large observational data. We evaluated the effects of 5 years of risk-reducing medication (tamoxifen/aromatase inhibitors) with annual screening mammography ± magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) compared with no screening, MRI, or risk-reducing medication. The modeled outcomes included invasive breast cancer, breast cancer death, side effects, false positives, and overdiagnosis. We conducted subgroup analyses for individual risk factors such as age, family history, and prior biopsy. Risk-reducing tamoxifen with annual screening (± MRI) decreased the risk of invasive breast cancer by 40% and breast cancer death by 57%, compared with no tamoxifen or screening. This is equivalent to an absolute reduction of 95 invasive breast cancers, and 42 breast cancer deaths per 1,000 high-risk women. However, these drugs are associated with side effects. For example, tamoxifen could increase the number of endometrial cancers up to 11 per 1,000 high-risk women. Benefits and harms varied by individual characteristics. The addition of risk-reducing medication to screening could further decrease the risk of breast cancer death. Clinical guidelines for high-risk women should consider integrating shared decision making for risk-reducing medication and screening on the basis of individual risk factors.",1989
36449695,"Survival Outcomes, Digital TILs, and On-treatment PET/CT During Neoadjuvant Therapy for HER2-positive Breast Cancer: Results from the Randomized PREDIX HER2 Trial.",Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,2023,"PREDIX HER2 is a randomized Phase II trial that compared neoadjuvant docetaxel, trastuzumab, and pertuzumab (THP) with trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) for HER2-positive breast cancer. Rates of pathologic complete response (pCR) did not differ between the two groups. Here, we present the survival outcomes from PREDIX HER2 and investigate metabolic response and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) as prognostic factors. In total, 202 patients with HER2-positive breast cancer were enrolled and 197 patients received six cycles of either THP or T-DM1. Secondary endpoints included event-free survival (EFS), recurrence-free survival (RFS), and overall survival (OS). Assessment with PET/CT was performed at baseline, after two and six treatment cycles. TILs were assessed manually at baseline biopsies, while image-based evaluation of TILs [digital TILs (DTIL)] was performed in digitized full-face sections. After a median follow-up of 5.21 years, there was no difference between the two treatment groups in terms of EFS [HR = 1.26; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.54-2.91], RFS (HR = 0.69; 95% CI, 0.24-1.93), or OS (HR = 0.52; 95% CI, 0.09-2.82). Higher SUVmax at cycle 2 (C2) predicted lower pCR (ORadj = 0.65; 95% CI, 0.48-0.87; P = 0.005) and worse EFS (HRadj = 1.27; 95% CI, 1.12-1.41; P < 0.001). Baseline TILs and DTILs provided additional prognostic information to clinical parameters and C2 SUVmax. Long-term outcomes following neoadjuvant T-DM1 were similar to neoadjuvant THP. SUVmax after two cycles of neoadjuvant therapy for HER2-positive breast cancer may be an independent predictor of both short- and long-term outcomes. Combined assessment with TILs may facilitate early selection of poor responders for alternative treatment strategies.",1756
36449662,Gallium-68-labeled Peptide PET Quantifies Tumor Exposure of PD-L1 Therapeutics.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,2023,"Immune checkpoint therapy (ICT) is currently ineffective in a majority of patients. Tumor drug exposure measurements can provide vital insights into mechanisms involved in the resistance of solid tumors to those therapeutics; however, tools to quantify in situ drug exposure are few. We have investigated the potential of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) pharmacodynamics, quantified using PET, to inform on the tumor exposure of anti-PD-L1 (aPD-L1) therapeutics. To noninvasively quantify PD-L1 levels, we first developed a novel peptide-based gallium-68-labeled binder, [68Ga]Ga-DK223, and evaluated its in vivo distribution, pharmacokinetics, and PD-L1 specificity in preclinical models of triple-negative breast cancer and urothelial carcinoma with variable PD-L1 expression. We then quantified baseline and accessible PD-L1 levels in tumors as a noninvasive pharmacodynamic measure to assess tumor exposure to two aPD-L1 antibodies (avelumab and durvalumab). DK223 exhibited a KD of 1.01±0.83 nmol/L for PD-L1 and inhibited the PD-1:PD-L1 interaction in a dose-dependent manner. [68Ga]Ga-DK223 provides high-contrast PET images within 60 minutes of administration and detects PD-L1 in an expression-dependent manner in xenograft models. PD-L1 pharmacodynamics measured using [68Ga]Ga-DK223-PET revealed that avelumab and durvalumab had similar exposure early during therapy, but only durvalumab exhibited sustained exposure at the tumor. [68Ga]Ga-DK223 detected variable PD-L1 levels and exhibited salient features required for clinical translation. [68Ga]Ga-DK223-PET could be useful for quantifying total PD-L1 levels at baseline and accessible PD-L1 levels during therapy to understand drug exposure at the tumor, thus supporting its use for guiding and optimizing ICT.",1778
36449062,Efficacy of preoperative embolization for metastatic spinal tumor surgery using angiographic vascularity assessment.,European radiology,2023,"Preoperative embolization (PE) for metastatic spinal tumors is a method of minimizing intraoperative blood loss during aggressive surgery. This study specified angiographic standards and investigated the influence of these and other factors on blood loss in patients with spinal metastases and various pathologies. The cohort comprised 126 consecutive patients receiving PE from 2015 to 2021. Their clinical, surgical, and angiographic characteristics were reviewed. Standard angiographic grading was used for vascularity assessment. Degree of embolization was divided into complete (≥ 90%), near complete (67 to < 90%), and partial (< 67%). Logistic regression analysis was used to investigate factors predictive of massive blood loss (> 2500 mL). A proportional odds model was used to assess factors predictive of the degree of embolization. Mean intraoperative blood loss was 1676 mL. Among the patients, 62 had hypervascular tumors and 64 had nonhypervascular tumors, according to the angiographic classification. Intraoperative blood loss differed significantly with embolization degree, both overall (p < 0.001) and in the hypervascular and nonhypervascular groups (p = 0.01 and 0.03). Angiographic hypervascularity, spinal metastasis invasiveness index, and embolization degree were significant predictors of massive blood loss in univariate analysis, but only embolization degree was significant in multivariate analysis. Only the presence of the radiculomedullary artery at the target level was significant in both the univariate and multivariate analyses for embolization degree. In addition to pathological classification, angiographic vascularity assessment is valuable. Although complete embolization is a reasonable goal, it is challenging to achieve in cases of visible radiculomedullary artery. • Angiography has a supplementary role in vascularity assessment for spinal metastatic surgery. • Better embolization degree is associated with less intraoperative blood loss in both angiographic hypervascular and nonhypervascular groups. • Presence of radiculomedullary artery in the target level causes worse embolization outcome.",2143

A total of 151 pathologically confirmed 1-2-cm gGISTs from seven institutions were identified by contrast-enhanced CT scans between January 2010 and March 2021. A detailed description of EUS morphological features was available for 73 gGISTs. The association between EUS or CT high-risk features and pathological malignant potential was evaluated. gGISTs were randomly divided into three groups to build the radiomics model, including 74 in the training cohort, 37 in validation cohort, and 40 in testing cohort. The ROIs covering the whole tumor volume were delineated on the CT images of the portal venous phase. The Pearson test and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) algorithm were used for feature selection, and the ROC curves were used to evaluate the model performance. The presence of EUS- and CT-based morphological high-risk features, including calcification, necrosis, intratumoral heterogeneity, irregular border, or surface ulceration, did not differ between very-low and intermediate risk 1-2-cm gGISTs (p > 0.05). The radiomics model consisting of five radiomics features showed favorable performance in discrimination of malignant 1-2-cm gGISTs, with the AUC of the training, validation, and testing cohort as 0.866, 0.812, and 0.766, respectively. Instead of CT- and EUS-based morphological high-risk features, the CT radiomics model could potentially be applied for preoperative risk stratification of 1-2-cm gGISTs. • The presence of EUS- and CT-based morphological high-risk factors, including calcification, necrosis, intratumoral heterogeneity, irregular border, or surface ulceration, did not correlate with the pathological malignant potential of 1-2-cm gGISTs. • The CT radiomics model could potentially be applied for preoperative risk stratification of 1-2-cm gGISTs.",2048
36449060,Primary bone tumor detection and classification in full-field bone radiographs via YOLO deep learning model.,European radiology,2023,"Automatic bone lesions detection and classifications present a critical challenge and are essential to support radiologists in making an accurate diagnosis of bone lesions. In this paper, we aimed to develop a novel deep learning model called You Only Look Once (YOLO) to handle detecting and classifying bone lesions on full-field radiographs with limited manual intervention. In this retrospective study, we used 1085 bone tumor radiographs and 345 normal bone radiographs from two centers between January 2009 and December 2020 to train and test our YOLO deep learning (DL) model. The trained model detected bone lesions and then classified these radiographs into normal, benign, intermediate, or malignant types. The intersection over union (IoU) was used to assess the model's performance in the detection task. Confusion matrices and Cohen's kappa scores were used for evaluating classification performance. Two radiologists compared diagnostic performance with the trained model using the external validation set. In the detection task, the model achieved accuracies of 86.36% and 85.37% in the internal and external validation sets, respectively. In the DL model, radiologist 1 and radiologist 2 achieved Cohen's kappa scores of 0.8187, 0.7927, and 0.9077 for four-way classification in the external validation set, respectively. The YOLO DL model illustrated a significantly higher accuracy for intermediate bone tumor classification than radiologist 1 (95.73% vs 88.08%, p = 0.004). The developed YOLO DL model could be used to assist radiologists at all stages of bone lesion detection and classification in full-field bone radiographs. • YOLO DL model can automatically detect bone neoplasms from full-field radiographs in one shot and then simultaneously classify radiographs into normal, benign, intermediate, or malignant. • The dataset used in this retrospective study includes normal bone radiographs. • YOLO can detect even some challenging cases with small volumes.",1984

36441795,"[18F]FluorThanatrace ([18F]FTT) PET Imaging of PARP-Inhibitor Drug-Target Engagement as a Biomarker of Response in Ovarian Cancer, a Pilot Study.",Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,2023,"PARP inhibitors have become the standard-of-care treatment for homologous recombination deficient (HRD) high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC). However, not all HRD tumors respond to PARPi. Biomarkers to predict response are needed. [18F]FluorThanatrace ([18F]FTT) is a PARPi-analog PET radiotracer that noninvasively measures PARP-1 expression. Herein, we evaluate [18F]FTT as a biomarker to predict response to PARPi in patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models and subjects with HRD HGSOC. In PDX models, [18F]FTT-PET was performed before and after PARPi (olaparib), ataxia-telangiectasia inhibitor (ATRi), or both (PARPi-ATRi). Changes in [18F]FTT were correlated with tumor volume changes. Subjects were imaged with [18F]FTT-PET at baseline and after ∼1 week of PARPi. Changes in [18F]FTT-PET uptake were compared with changes in tumor size (RECISTv1.1), CA-125, and progression-free survival (PFS). A decrease in [18F]FTT tumor uptake after PARPi correlated with response to PARPi, or PARPi-ATRi treatment in PARPi-resistant PDX models (r = 0.77-0.81). In subjects (n = 11), percent difference in [18F]FTT-PET after ∼7 days of PARPi compared with baseline correlated with best RECIST response (P = 0.01), best CA-125 response (P = 0.033), and PFS (P = 0.027). All subjects with >50% reduction in [18F]FTT uptake had >6-month PFS and >50% reduction in CA-125. Utilizing only baseline [18F]FTT uptake did not predict such responses. The decline in [18F]FTT uptake shortly after PARPi initiation provides a measure of drug-target engagement and shows promise as a biomarker to guide PARPi therapies in this pilot study. These results support additional preclinical mechanistic and clinical studies in subjects receiving PARPi ± combination therapy. See related commentary by Liu and Zamarin, p. 1384.",1802
36435877,The value of quantitative MR elastography-based stiffness for assessing the microvascular invasion grade in hepatocellular carcinoma.,European radiology,2023,"To evaluate the potential diagnostic value of MR elastography (MRE)-based stiffness to noninvasively predict the microvascular invasion (MVI) grade in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). One hundred eighty-five patients with histopathology-proven HCC who underwent MRI and MRE examinations before hepatectomy were retrospectively enrolled. According to the three-tiered MVI grading system, the MVI was divided into negative-MVI (n = 89) and positive-MVI (n = 96) groups, and the latter group was categorized into mild-MVI (n = 49) and severe-MVI (n = 47) subgroups. Logistic regression and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) analyses were used to determine the predictors associated with MVI grade and analyze their performances, respectively. Among the 185 patients, tumor size ≥ 50 mm (p = 0.031), tumor stiffness (TS)/liver stiffness (LS) > 1.47 (p = 0.001), TS > 4.33 kPa (p < 0.001), and nonsmooth tumor margin (p = 0.006) were significant independent predictors for positive-MVI. Further analyzing the subgroups, tumor size ≥ 50 mm (p < 0.001), TS > 5.35 kPa (p = 0.001), and AFP level > 400 ng/mL (p = 0.044) were independently associated with severe-MVI. The models incorporating MRE and clinical-radiological features together performed better for evaluating positive-MVI (AUC: 0.846) and severe-MVI (AUC: 0.802) than the models using clinical-radiological predictors alone (AUC: positive-/severe-MVI, 0.737/0.743). Analysis of recurrence-free survival and overall survival showed the predicted positive-MVI/severe-MVI groups based on combined models had significantly poorer prognoses than predicted negative-MVI/mild-MVI groups, respectively (all p < 0.05). MRE-based stiffness was an independent predictor for both the positive-MVI and severe-MVI. The combination of MRE and clinical-radiological models might be a useful tool for evaluating HCC patients' prognoses underwent hepatectomy by preoperatively predicting the MVI grade. • The severe-microvascular invasion (MVI) grade had the highest tumor stiffness (TS), followed by mild-MVI and non-MVI, and there were significances among the three different MVI grades. • MR elastography (MRE)-based stiffness value was an independent predictor of positive-MVI and severe-MVI in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) preoperatively. • When combined with clinical-radiological models, MRE could significantly improve the predictive performance for MVI grade. Patients with predicted positive-MVI/severe-MVI based on the combined models had worse recurrence-free survival and overall survival than those with negative-MVI/mild-MVI, respectively.",2619
36434398,Optimal radiological gallbladder lesion characterization by combining visual assessment with CT-based radiomics.,European radiology,2023,"Differentiating benign gallbladder diseases from gallbladder cancer (GBC) remains a radiological challenge because they can appear very similar on imaging. This study aimed at investigating whether CT-based radiomic features of suspicious gallbladder lesions analyzed by machine learning algorithms could adequately discriminate benign gallbladder disease from GBC. In addition, the added value of machine learning models to radiological visual CT-scan interpretation was assessed. Patients were retrospectively selected based on confirmed histopathological diagnosis and available contrast-enhanced portal venous phase CT-scan. The radiomic features were extracted from the entire gallbladder, then further analyzed by machine learning classifiers based on Lasso regression, Ridge regression, and XG Boosting. The results of the best-performing classifier were combined with radiological visual CT diagnosis and then compared with radiological visual CT assessment alone. In total, 127 patients were included: 83 patients with benign gallbladder lesions and 44 patients with GBC. Among all machine learning classifiers, XG boosting achieved the best AUC of 0.81 (95% CI 0.72-0.91) and the highest accuracy rate of 73% (95% CI 65-80%). When combining radiological visual interpretation and predictions of the XG boosting classifier, the highest diagnostic performance was achieved with an AUC of 0.98 (95% CI 0.96-1.00), a sensitivity of 91% (95% CI 86-100%), a specificity of 93% (95% CI 90-100%), and an accuracy of 92% (95% CI 90-100%). Machine learning analysis of CT-based radiomic features shows promising results in discriminating benign from malignant gallbladder disease. Combining CT-based radiomic analysis and radiological visual interpretation provided the most optimal strategy for GBC and benign gallbladder disease differentiation. Radiomic-based machine learning algorithms are able to differentiate benign gallbladder disease from gallbladder cancer. Combining machine learning algorithms with a radiological visual interpretation of gallbladder lesions at CT increases the specificity, compared to visual interpretation alone, from 73 to 93% and the accuracy from 85 to 92%. Combined use of machine learning algorithms and radiological visual assessment seems the most optimal strategy for GBC and benign gallbladder disease differentiation.",2360

A total of 215 tumours (129 for training and 31 for internal validation, centre 1; 55 for external validation, centre 2) were included. MIBC was confirmed by pathological examination. VI-RADS scores were provided by two groups of radiologists (readers 1 and readers 2) independently. A deep convolutional neural network was constructed in the training set, and validation was conducted on the internal and external validation sets. ROC analysis was performed to evaluate the performance for MIBC diagnosis. The AUCs of the DL model, readers 1, and readers 2 were as follows: in the internal validation set, 0.963, 0.843, and 0.852, respectively; in the external validation set, 0.861, 0.808, and 0.876, respectively. The accuracy of the DL model in the tumours scored VI-RADS 2 or 3 was higher than that of radiologists in the external validation set: for readers 1, 0.886 vs. 0.600, p = 0.006; for readers 2, 0.879 vs. 0.636, p = 0.021. The average processing time (38 s and 43 s in two validation sets) of the DL method was much shorter than the readers, with a reduction of over 100 s in both validation sets. Compared to radiologists using VI-RADS, the DL method had a better diagnostic performance, shorter processing time, and robust generalisability, indicating good potential for diagnosing MIBC. • The DL model shows robust performance for MIBC diagnosis in both internal and external validation. • The diagnostic performance of the DL model in the tumours scored VI-RADS 2 or 3 is better than that obtained by radiologists using VI-RADS. • The DL method shows potential in the preoperative assessment of MIBC.",1840

This study aims to construct a non-invasive model for predicting molecular subtype alteration in breast cancer after NAT. Eighty-two estrogen receptor (ER)-negative/ human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative or ER-low-positive/HER2-negative breast cancer patients who underwent NAT and completed baseline MRI were retrospectively recruited between July 2010 and November 2020. Subtype alteration was observed in 21 cases after NAT. A 2D-DenseUNet machine-learning model was built to perform automatic segmentation of breast cancer. 851 radiomic features were extracted from each MRI sequence (T2-weighted imaging, ADC, DCE, and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted imaging), both in the manual and auto-segmentation masks. All samples were divided into a training set (n = 66) and a test set (n = 16). XGBoost model with 5-fold cross-validation was performed to predict molecular subtype alterations in breast cancer patients after NAT. The predictive ability of these models was subsequently evaluated by the AUC of the ROC curve, sensitivity, and specificity. A model consisting of three radiomics features from the manual segmentation of multi-sequence MRI achieved favorable predictive efficacy in identifying molecular subtype alteration in BC after NAT (cross-validation set: AUC = 0.908, independent test set: AUC = 0.864); whereas an automatic segmentation approach of BC lesions on the DCE sequence produced good segmentation results (Dice similarity coefficient = 0.720). A machine learning model based on baseline MRI is proven useful for predicting molecular subtype alterations in breast cancer after NAT. • Machine learning models using MRI-based radiomics signature have the ability to predict molecular subtype alterations in breast cancer after neoadjuvant therapy, which subsequently affect treatment protocols. • The application of deep learning in the automatic segmentation of breast cancer lesions from MRI images shows the potential to replace manual segmentation..",2113

We compared tumor burden-quantified as peritoneal cancer index (PCI) by preoperative US and CT (US-CT-PCI)-with surgical findings. Next, we assessed the prognostic value of US-CT PCI and imaging features in determining the completeness of cytoreduction (CCR) score using multivariate analysis. US-CT PCI demonstrated a high PCI evaluation accuracy under moderate tumor burden. Higher US-CT PCI could predict incomplete resection. In addition, we identified imaging features such as mesenteric involvement as an independent predictor of incomplete resection (hazard ratio (HR) = 2.006; p = 0.007). US-CT PCI allowed us to predict the completeness of cytoreductive surgery in patients with PMP. Moreover, the combined US and CT imaging detected several features indicating incomplete cytoreduction. • Ultrasonography (US) can act as a complementary diagnostic modality in peritoneal cancer index (PCI) evaluation by combining CT in the small bowel area and US in the abdominal area. • A modified peritoneal cancer index (US-CT PCI) helps preoperatively evaluate tumor burden with high accuracy and allows to predict incomplete resection. • US-CT PCI of 20 or above and the involvement of particular structures such as mesentery, independently indicate incomplete resection.",1659

Purpose To perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of the diagnostic performance of pelvic MRI interpreted using the ADNEX or O-RADS MRI stratification systems to characterize US-indeterminate adnexal lesions and of the category-wise malignancy rates. Materials and Methods A systematic literature search from May 2013 (publication of the ADNEX MR score) to September 2022 was performed. Studies reporting the use of pelvic MRI interpreted with the ADNEX or O-RADS MRI systems to characterize US-indeterminate adnexal lesions, with pathologic examination and/or follow-up as the reference standard, were included. Summary estimates of diagnostic performance were obtained with the bivariate random-effects model, while category-wise summary malignancy rates of O-RADS MRI 2, 3, 4, and 5 lesions were obtained with a random-effects model. Effects of covariates on heterogeneity and diagnostic performance were investigated through meta-regression. Results Thirteen study parts from 12 studies (3731 women, 4520 adnexal lesions) met the inclusion criteria. Diagnostic performance meta-analysis for 4012 lesions found a 92% summary sensitivity (95% CI: 88, 95) and a 91% summary specificity (95% CI: 89, 93). The meta-analysis of malignancy rates for 3641 lesions showed summary malignancy rates of 0.1% (95% CI: 0, 1) among O-RADS MRI 2 lesions, 6% (95% CI: 3, 9) among O-RADS MRI 3 lesions, 60% (95% CI: 52, 67) among O-RADS MRI 4 lesions, and 96% (95% CI: 92, 99) among O-RADS MRI 5 lesions. Conclusion Pelvic MRI interpreted with the Ovarian-Adnexal Reporting and Data System (O-RADS) MRI lexicon had high diagnostic performance for the characterization of US-indeterminate adnexal lesions. Summary estimates of malignancy rates in the O-RADS MRI 4 and O-RADS MRI 5 categories were higher than predicted ones. © RSNA, 2022 ",2112

36396792,Automated segmentation of craniopharyngioma on MR images using U-Net-based deep convolutional neural network.,European radiology,2023,"To develop a U-Net-based deep learning model for automated segmentation of craniopharyngioma. A total number of 264 patients diagnosed with craniopharyngiomas were included in this research. Pre-treatment MRIs were collected, annotated, and used as ground truth to learn and evaluate the deep learning model. Thirty-eight patients from another institution were used for independently external testing. The proposed segmentation model was constructed based on a U-Net architecture. Dice similarity coefficients (DSCs), Hausdorff distance of 95% percentile (95HD), Jaccard value, true positive rate (TPR), and false positive rate (FPR) of each case were calculated. One-way ANOVA analysis was used to investigate if the model performance was associated with the radiological characteristics of tumors. The proposed model showed a good performance in segmentation with average DSCs of 0.840, Jaccard of 0.734, TPR of 0.820, FPR of 0.000, and 95HD of 3.669 mm. It performed feasibly in the independent external test set, with average DSCs of 0.816, Jaccard of 0.704, TPR of 0.765, FPR of 0.000, and 95HD of 4.201 mm. Also, one-way ANOVA suggested the performance was not statistically associated with radiological characteristics, including predominantly composition (p = 0.370), lobulated shape (p = 0.353), compressed or enclosed ICA (p = 0.809), and cavernous sinus invasion (p = 0.283). The proposed deep learning model shows promising results for the automated segmentation of craniopharyngioma. • The segmentation model based on U-Net showed good performance in segmentation of craniopharyngioma. • The proposed model showed good performance regardless of the radiological characteristics of craniopharyngioma. • The model achieved feasibility in the independent external dataset obtained from another center.",1811

The IMaging PAtients for Cancer drug SelecTion-Renal Cell Carcinoma study objective was to assess the predictive value of [18F]FDG PET/CT and [89Zr]Zr-DFO-girentuximab PET/CT for WW duration in patients with mccRCC. Between February 2015 and March 2018, 48 patients were enrolled, including 40 evaluable patients with good (n = 14) and intermediate (n = 26) prognosis. Baseline contrast-enhanced CT, [18F]FDG and [89Zr]Zr-DFO-girentuximab PET/CT were performed. Primary endpoint was the time to disease progression warranting systemic treatment. Maximum standardized uptake values (SUVmax) were measured using lesions on CT images coregistered to PET/CT. High and low uptake groups were defined on the basis of median geometric mean SUVmax of RECIST-measurable lesions across patients. The median WW time was 16.1 months [95% confidence interval (CI): 9.0-31.7]. The median WW period was shorter in patients with high [18F]FDG tumor uptake than those with low uptake (9.0 vs. 36.2 months; HR, 5.6; 95% CI: 2.4-14.7; P < 0.001). Patients with high [89Zr]Zr-DFO-girentuximab tumor uptake had a median WW period of 9.3 versus 21.3 months with low uptake (HR, 1.7; 95% CI: 0.9-3.3; P = 0.13). Patients with ""W&W criteria"" had a longer median WW period of 21.3 compared with patients without: 9.3 months (HR, 1.9; 95% CI: 0.9-3.9; Pone-sided = 0.034). Adding [18F]FDG uptake to the ""W&W criteria"" improved the prediction of WW duration (P < 0.001); whereas [89Zr]Zr-DFO-girentuximab did not (P = 0.53). In patients with good- or intermediate-risk mccRCC, low [18F]FDG uptake is associated with prolonged WW.

36385560,Intravital imaging to study cancer progression and metastasis.,Nature reviews. Cancer,2023,"Navigation through the bulk tumour, entry into the blood vasculature, survival in the circulation, exit at distant sites and resumption of proliferation are all steps necessary for tumour cells to successfully metastasize. The ability of tumour cells to complete these steps is highly dependent on the timing and sequence of the interactions that these cells have with the tumour microenvironment (TME), including stromal cells, the extracellular matrix and soluble factors. The TME thus plays a major role in determining the overall metastatic phenotype of tumours. The complexity and cause-and-effect dynamics of the TME cannot currently be recapitulated in vitro or inferred from studies of fixed tissue, and are best studied in vivo, in real time and at single-cell resolution. Intravital imaging (IVI) offers these capabilities, and recent years have been a time of immense growth and innovation in the field. Here we review some of the recent advances in IVI of mammalian models of cancer and describe how IVI is being used to understand cancer progression and metastasis, and to develop novel treatments and therapies. We describe new techniques that allow access to a range of tissue and cancer types, novel fluorescent reporters and biosensors that allow fate mapping and the probing of functional and phenotypic states, and the clinical applications that have arisen from applying these techniques, reporters and biosensors to study cancer. We finish by presenting some of the challenges that remain in the field, how to address them and future perspectives.",1568

36380196,Quantitative synthetic MRI for predicting locally advanced rectal cancer response to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy.,European radiology,2023,"To investigate the value of pre-treatment quantitative synthetic MRI (SyMRI) for predicting a good response to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT) in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer. This prospective study enrolled 63 patients with locally advanced rectal cancer scheduled to undergo preoperative chemoradiotherapy from January 2019 to June 2021. T1 relaxation time (T1), T2 relaxation time (T2), proton density (PD) from synthetic MRI, and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) from diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) were measured. Independent-sample t-test, the Mann-Whitney U test, the Delong test, and receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analyses were used to predict the pathologic complete response (pCR) and T-downstaging. Among the 63 patients, 19 (30%) achieved pCR and 44 (70%) did not, and 24 (38%) achieved T-downstaging, while 44 (62%) did not. The mean T1 and T2 values were significantly lower in the pCR group compared with those in the non-pCR group and in the T-downstage group compared with those in the non-T-downstage group (all p < 0.05). There were no significant differences in the PD and ADC values between the two groups. There were no significant differences between the mean values of T1 and T2 for predicting pCR after CRT (AUC, 0.767 vs. 0.831, p = 0.37). There were no significant differences between the AUC values of T1 and T2 values for the assessment of post-CRT T-downstaging (AUC, 0.746 vs. 0.820, p = 0.506). In patients with locally advanced rectal cancer, the synthetic MRI-derived T1 relaxation time and T2 relaxation time values are promising imaging markers for predicting a good response to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. • Mean T1 and T2 values were significantly lower in the pathologic complete response group and the T-downstage group. • There were no significant differences in the proton density and apparent diffusion coefficient values between the two groups.",1933

Purpose To evaluate the feasibility and accuracy of generating simulated contrast-enhanced T1-weighted breast MRI scans from precontrast MRI sequences in biopsy-proven invasive breast cancer with use of deep learning. Materials and Methods Women with invasive breast cancer and a contrast-enhanced breast MRI examination that was performed for initial evaluation of the extent of disease between January 2015 and December 2019 at a single academic institution were retrospectively identified. A three-dimensional, fully convolutional deep neural network simulated contrast-enhanced T1-weighted breast MRI scans from five precontrast sequences (T1-weighted non-fat-suppressed [FS], T1-weighted FS, T2-weighted FS, apparent diffusion coefficient, and diffusion-weighted imaging). For qualitative assessment, four breast radiologists (with 3-15 years of experience) blinded to whether the method of contrast was real or simulated assessed image quality (excellent, acceptable, good, poor, or unacceptable), presence of tumor enhancement, and maximum index mass size by using 22 pairs of real and simulated contrast-enhanced MRI scans. Quantitative comparison was performed using whole-breast similarity and error metrics and Dice coefficient analysis of enhancing tumor overlap.

Data for all adult patients who underwent X-ray examinations from August 2004 to April 2020 in a general hospital was collected, including sex, age, primary diagnosis, and X-ray examination. Based on the Biological Effects of Ionizing Radiations report, age and sex and effective dose for a single X-ray examination were used to calculate the lifetime attributable risk (LAR). Patients whose cancer LAR values were in the top 5% were considered to have a high cancer risk; the factors influencing this status were explored by using multivariate logistic regression analyses. In total, 1,143,413 patients with 3,301,286 X-ray examinations were included. LARs of cancer incidence and death were < 0.2% and < 0.13% among 95% of patients and they were > 1% among 0.21% and 0.07% of patients. High risks of incidence and death were significantly associated with corrected exposure frequency (odds ratio [OR], 1.080 and 1.080), sex (OR, male vs. female, 0.421 and 0.372), and year of birth (OR, 1.088 and 1.054), with all p values < 0.001. Among 20 disease categories, congenital disease (OR, 3.792 and 4.024), genitourinary disease (OR, 3.608 and 3.202), digestive disease (OR, 3.247 and 3.272), and tumor disease (OR, 2.706 and 2.767) had the strongest associations with high risks of incidence and death (all p values < 0.001). Cancer risk induced by diagnostic X-ray examinations can be considered acceptable clinically. Patients having certain diseases are potentially at a relative higher risk due to recurrent examinations. • It was the first large-scale investigation of cumulative X-ray exposure in China, involving more than 3.3 million X-ray scans of all types of diagnostic X-ray examinations for about 1.1 million patients during the past 16 years. • The study revealed that the incidence risk of cancer induced by X-ray-related examinations was 0.01% on average, which was substantially lower than that of cancer induced by non-X-ray radiation.

This retrospective study includes 151 LARC patients divided into internal (centre A, n = 100) and external validation set (centre B, n = 51). The clinical and MR radiomics features were derived to construct clinical, radiomics, and clinical-radiomics model. Random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), logistic regression (LR), K-nearest neighbor (KNN), naive Bayes (NB), and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) were used as classifiers. The predictive performance was assessed using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Eleven radiomics and four clinical features were chosen as pCR-related signatures. In the radiomics model, the RF algorithm achieved 74.0% accuracy (an AUC of 0.863) and 84.4% (an AUC of 0.829) in the internal and external validation sets. In the clinical-radiomics model, RF algorithm exhibited high and stable predictive performance in the internal and external validation datasets with an AUC of 0.906 (87.3% sensitivity, 73.7% specificity, 76.0% accuracy) and 0.872 (77.3% sensitivity, 88.2% specificity, 86.3% accuracy), respectively. RF showed a better predictive performance than the other classifiers in the external validation datasets of three models. The multiparametric clinical-radiomics model combined with RF algorithm is optimal for predicting pCR in the internal and external sets, and might help improve clinical stratifying management of LARC patients. • A two-centre study showed that radiomics analysis of pre- and post-nCRT multiparameter MR images could predict pCR in patients with LARC. • The combined model was superior to the clinical and radiomics model in predicting pCR in locally advanced rectal cancer. • The RF classifier performed best in the current study.",2091

This study included patients who underwent resection for ascending or descending colon cancer between July 2010 and February 2013. Positive ctCRM was defined as tumor distance to the retromesenteric plane of ≤ 1 mm. The origin of positive CRM was divided into primary tumor or other tumor components including lymph nodes, tumor deposits, or extramural venous invasions. Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify preoperative factors to predict pathologic CRM (pCRM). A Cox proportional hazards model was used in multivariable analysis to determine the preoperative factors affecting disease-free survival (DFS). A total of 274 patients (mean age, 64.0 years ± 11.0 [standard deviation]; 157 men) with retroperitonealized colon cancer were evaluated. Of 274 patients, 67 patients (24.5%) had positive CRM on surgical pathology. The accuracy of preoperative CT in predicting pCRM was 79.6% (218/274). Among preoperative factors, only CRM assessment on CT was independently associated with pCRM (p < 0.001). Positive ctCRM by primary tumor was an independent factor for DFS (HR, 3.362 [1.714-6.593]) and systemic recurrence (HR, 3.715 [1.787-7.724], but not for local recurrence on multivariable analyses. Preoperative CT can accurately predict pCRM, and positive ctCRM by primary tumor is an independent risk factor for DFS and systemic recurrence, but not for local recurrence in retroperitonealized colon cancer. • Preoperative CT can predict pathologic circumferential resection margin (CRM) with approximately 80% of accuracy in patients with retroperitonealized colon cancer. • Positive CRM by a primary tumor on preoperative CT is a poor prognostic factor for disease-free survival and systemic recurrence in patients with retroperitonealized colon cancer. • CRM involvement on CT was not associated with local recurrence in patients with retroperitonealized colon cancer.",2117

Patient data with 2 reconstruction kernels and phantom data with 22 reconstruction kernels were included. Eighty-five patients were studied for lymph node metastasis (LNM) prediction, and 164 patients for differential diagnosis between lung cancer (LC) and pulmonary tuberculosis (TB). Two convolutional neural network (CNN) models were developed to convert images (i) from B70f to B30f (CNNa) and (ii) from B30f to B70f (CNNb). Model performance between the two kernels was evaluated using AUC and compared with other well-known harmonization methods. Patient-normalized feature difference (PNFD) was used to identify the incompatible kernels (i.e., kernel with median PNFD > 1) with baseline (B30f/B70f), and measure the ability of the CNN models to convert the non-comparable kernels. For LC versus pulmonary TB diagnosis, AUCs of CNNa vs. others were 0.85 vs. 0.54-0.74 (p = 0.0001-0.0003), and for CNNb vs. others: 0.87 vs. 0.54-0.86 (p = 0.0001-0.55). For LNM prediction, AUCs of CNNa vs. others were 0.68 vs. 0.56-0.61 (p = 0.10-0.39), and for CNNb vs. others: 0.78 vs. 0.70-0.73 (p = 0.07-0.40). After CNN harmonization, 17 of 20 (85%) of investigated unknown kernels produced comparable radiomics feature values relative to baseline (median PNFD from 1.10-2.31 to 0.23-1.13). The CNN harmonization effectively improved performance of radiomics models between reconstruction kernels in different clinical tasks, and reduced feature differences between unknown kernels vs. baseline. • The soft (B30f) and sharp (B70f) kernels strongly affect radiomics reproducibility and generalizability. • The convolutional neural network (CNN) harmonization methods performed better than location-scale (ComBat and centering-scaling) and matrix factorization harmonization methods (based on singular value decomposition (SVD) and independent component analysis (ICA)) in both clinical tasks. • The CNN harmonization methods improve feature reproducibility not only between specific kernels (B30f and B70f) from the same scanner, but also between unobserved kernels from different scanners of different vendors.",2380
36351060,Immunotherapeutic Targeting and PET Imaging of DLL3 in Small-Cell Neuroendocrine Prostate Cancer.,Cancer research,2023,"Effective treatments for de novo and treatment-emergent small-cell/neuroendocrine (t-SCNC) prostate cancer represent an unmet need for this disease. Using metastatic biopsies from patients with advanced cancer, we demonstrate that delta-like ligand 3 (DLL3) is expressed in de novo and t-SCNC and is associated with reduced survival. We develop a PET agent, [89Zr]-DFO-DLL3-scFv, that detects DLL3 levels in mouse SCNC models. In multiple patient-derived xenograft models, AMG 757 (tarlatamab), a half-life-extended bispecific T-cell engager (BiTE) immunotherapy that redirects CD3-positive T cells to kill DLL3-expressing cells, exhibited potent and durable antitumor activity. Late relapsing tumors after AMG 757 treatment exhibited lower DLL3 levels, suggesting antigen loss as a resistance mechanism, particularly in tumors with heterogeneous DLL3 expression. These findings have been translated into an ongoing clinical trial of AMG 757 in de novo and t-SCNC, with a confirmed objective partial response in a patient with histologically confirmed SCNC. Overall, these results identify DLL3 as a therapeutic target in SCNC and demonstrate that DLL3-targeted BiTE immunotherapy has significant antitumor activity in this aggressive prostate cancer subtype. The preclinical and clinical evaluation of DLL3-directed immunotherapy, AMG 757, and development of a PET radiotracer for noninvasive DLL3 detection demonstrate the potential of targeting DLL3 in SCNC prostate cancer.",1477

Results of the clinical laboratory tests for metabolic levels and organ and tissue-specific FDG uptake obtained from the cachexia and non-cachexia groups were compared statistically. Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify independent variables associated with cachexia in the development cohort for generating the regression model. The performance of the model was tested using the data from a validation cohort and evaluated by area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Based on the data from the development cohort of 286 patients and a validation cohort of 104 patients, it is found that age, white blood cell count, peak standardized uptake value (SUV) of the liver, and minimum SUV of lean body mass of visceral fat and subcutaneous fat were independently associated with cachexia. The model incorporating these variables reached an AUC of 0.777 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.721, 0.833) in the development cohort and an AUC of 0.729 (95% CI: 0.629, 0.829) in the validation cohort. Organ and tissue-specific abnormal glucose metabolism as measured by PET/CT can be used as a biomarker for cancer-associated cachexia. • Patients with cancer-associated cachexia have reduced FDG uptake in the liver and increased FDG uptake in visceral fat and subcutaneous fat. • FDG uptake of the liver, visceral fat, and subcutaneous fat can be independent risk factors for identifying cancer-associated cachexia. • Cancer-associated cachexia can be classified using the model that incorporates age, white blood cell count, FDG uptake of the liver, and visceral and subcutaneous fat can diagnose with an AUC of 0.729.",2190

Fifty multiple myeloma patients (mean age 67.7 ± 10.9 years,16 females) were prospectively enrolled. Unenhanced whole-body CTs were clinically indicated and performed on DS-EID-CT and DS-PCD-CT (median time difference: 12 months). DS-PCD-CT was performed in Quantumplus UHR mode and DS-EID-CT was performed using dual-energy mode. DS-PCD-CT kernel was set at Br64 with Quantum iterative reconstruction strength Q1; for DS-EID-CT a comparable I70f kernel with SAFIRE iterative reconstruction strength 1 was used. Two independent radiologists assessed image quality subjectively using a 5-point Likert scale considering delineation and sharpness of trabecular bone and lytic bone lesions in the spine and pelvic bones. Additionally, ImageJ was used for quantification of bony septa inside the cancellous bone and through or the edges of osteolysis. Overall quality as well as detectability and sharpness in the delineation of lytic bone lesions were superior for DS-PCD-CT compared with DS-EID-CT (p < 0.0001). The inter-reader agreement for subjective image quality readings showed excellent consistency(α = 94.2-98.8). CTDI and DLP mean values for DS-PCD-CT and DS-EID-CT were 1107.4 ± 247.6 mGy*cm and 8.2 ± 1.8 mGy vs. 1344.3 ± 204.6 mGy*cm and 10.1 ± 1.9 mGy. The quantitative metric for bone microstructure in the femoral head showed significantly better visualization of trabeculae in DS-PCD-CT compared with DS-EID-CT (p < 0.0001). Quantitative analyses of edge sharpness of osteolysis showed significant steeper edges for DS-PCD-CT (p < 0.0001). DS-PCD-CT significantly improves spatial resolution of bony microstructure and lytic bone lesions compared to DS-EID-CT. • Application of photon-counting detector CT is superior to dual-source dual-energy integrating detector in clinical workup of multiple myeloma patients. • Compared to energy integrating detectors, photon-counting detectors significantly increase the spatial resolution of bone microstructure including disease-related lytic bone lesions in patients with multiple myeloma.",2347

36348090,MRI can accurately diagnose breast cancer during lactation.,European radiology,2023,"To test the diagnostic performance of breast dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI during lactation. Datasets of 198 lactating patients, including 66 pregnancy-associated breast cancer (PABC) patients and 132 controls, who were scanned by DCE on 1.5-T MRI, were retrospectively evaluated. Six blinded, expert radiologists independently read a single DCE maximal intensity projection (MIP) image for each case and were asked to determine whether malignancy was suspected and the background-parenchymal-enhancement (BPE) grade. Likewise, computer-aided diagnosis CAD MIP images were independently read by the readers. Contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) analysis was measured and compared among four consecutive acquisitions of DCE subtraction images. For MIP-DCE images, the readers achieved the following means: sensitivity 93.3%, specificity 80.3%, positive-predictive-value 70.4, negative-predictive-value 96.2, and diagnostic accuracy of 84.6%, with a substantial inter-rater agreement (Kappa = 0.673, p value < 0.001). Most false-positive interpretations were attributed to either the MIP presentation, an underlying benign lesion, or an asymmetric appearance due to prior treatments. CAD's derived diagnostic accuracy was similar (p = 0.41). BPE grades were significantly increased in the healthy controls compared to the PABC cohort (p < 0.001). CNR significantly decreased by 11-13% in each of the four post-contrast images (p < 0.001). Breast DCE MRI maintains its high efficiency among the lactating population, probably due to a vascular-steal phenomenon, which causes a significant reduction of BPE in cancer cases. Upon validation by prospective, multicenter trials, this study could open up the opportunity for breast MRI to be indicated in the screening and diagnosis of lactating patients, with the aim of facilitating an earlier diagnosis of PABC. • A single DCE MIP image was sufficient to reach a mean sensitivity of 93.3% and NPV of 96.2%, to stress the high efficiency of breast MRI during lactation. • Reduction in BPE among PABC patients compared to the lactating controls suggests that several factors, including a possible vascular steal phenomenon, may affect cancer patients. • Reduction in CNR along four consecutive post-contrast acquisitions highlights the differences in breast carcinoma and BPE kinetics and explains the sufficient conspicuity on the first subtracted image.",2397

36323984,Is it possible to use low-dose deep learning reconstruction for the detection of liver metastases on CT routinely?,European radiology,2023,"To compare the image quality and hepatic metastasis detection of low-dose deep learning image reconstruction (DLIR) with full-dose filtered back projection (FBP)/iterative reconstruction (IR). A contrast-detail phantom consisting of low-contrast objects was scanned at five CT dose index levels (10, 6, 3, 2, and 1 mGy). A total of 154 participants with 305 hepatic lesions who underwent abdominal CT were enrolled in a prospective non-inferiority trial with a three-arm design based on phantom results. Data sets with full dosage (13.6 mGy) and low dosages (9.5, 6.8, or 4.1 mGy) were acquired from two consecutive portal venous acquisitions, respectively. All images were reconstructed with FBP (reference), IR (control), and DLIR (test). Eleven readers evaluated phantom data sets for object detectability using a two-alternative forced-choice approach. Non-inferiority analyses were performed to interpret the differences in image quality and metastasis detection of low-dose DLIR relative to full-dose FBP/IR. The phantom experiment showed the dose reduction potential from DLIR was up to 57% based on the reference FBP dose index. Radiation decreases of 30% and 50% resulted in non-inferior image quality and hepatic metastasis detection with DLIR compared to full-dose FBP/IR. Radiation reduction of 70% by DLIR performed inferiorly in detecting small metastases (< 1 cm) compared to full-dose FBP (difference: -0.112; 95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.178 to 0.047) and full-dose IR (difference: -0.123; 95% CI: -0.182 to 0.053) (p < 0.001). DLIR enables a 50% dose reduction for detecting low-contrast hepatic metastases while maintaining comparable image quality to full-dose FBP and IR. • Non-inferiority study showed that deep learning image reconstruction (DLIR) can reduce the dose to oncological patients with low-contrast lesions without compromising the diagnostic information. • Radiation dose levels for DLIR can be reduced to 50% of full-dose FBP and IR for detecting low-contrast hepatic metastases, while maintaining comparable image quality. • The reduction of radiation by 70% by DLIR is clinically acceptable but insufficient for detecting small low-contrast hepatic metastases (< 1 cm).",2211
36322193,Detection efficacy of analog [,European radiology,2023,"This prospective study compared the detection efficacy of analog  Eighty-seven patients with lung adenocarcinoma featuring GGNs who underwent dF and dN PET/CT were enrolled. Based on the GGN component, diameter, and solid-part size, 87 corresponding patients examined using aF PET/CT were included, with age, sex, and lesion characteristics closely matched. Images were visually evaluated, and the tumor to background ratio (TBR) was used for semi-quantitative analysis. Ultimately, 40 and 47 patients with pure GGNs (pGGNs) and mixed GGNs (mGGNs), respectively, were included. dF PET/CT revealed more positive lesions and higher tracer uptake in GGNs than did aF PET/CT (53/87 vs. 26/87, p < 0.05; TBR: 3.08 ± 4.85 vs. 1.42 ± 0.93, p < 0.05), especially in mGGNs (44/47 vs. 26/47, p < 0.05; TBR: 4.48 ± 6.17 vs. 1.78 ± 1.16, p < 0.05).

American journal of roentgenology,2023,Contrast-enhanced mammography (CEM) is an emerging functional breast imaging technique that entails the acquisition of dual-energy digital mammographic images after IV administration of iodine-based contrast material. CEM-guided biopsy technology was introduced in 2019 and approved by the U.S. FDA in 2020. This technology's availability enables direct sampling of suspicious enhancement seen only on or predominantly on recombined CEM images and addresses a major obstacle to the clinical implementation of CEM technology. The literature describing clinical indications and procedural techniques of CEM-guided biopsy is scarce.

36307554,Can quantitative peritumoral CT radiomics features predict the prognosis of patients with non-small cell lung cancer? A systematic review.,European radiology,2023,"To provide an overarching evaluation of the value of peritumoral CT radiomics features for predicting the prognosis of non-small cell lung cancer and to assess the quality of the available studies. The PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases were searched for studies predicting the prognosis in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) using CT-based peritumoral radiomics features. Information about the patient, CT-scanner, and radiomics analyses were all extracted for the included studies. Study quality was assessed using the Radiomics Quality Score (RQS) and the Prediction Model Risk of Bias Assessment Tool (PROBAST). Thirteen studies were included with 2942 patients from 2017 to 2022. Only one study was prospective, and the others were all retrospectively designed. Manual segmentation and multicenter studies were performed by 69% and 46% of the included studies, respectively. 3D-Slicer and MATLAB software were most commonly used for the segmentation of lesions and extraction of features. The peritumoral region was most frequently defined as dilated from the tumor boundary of 15 mm, 20 mm, or 30 mm. The median RQS of the studies was 13 (range 4-19), while all of included studies were assessed as having a high risk of bias (ROB) overall. Peritumoral radiomics features based on CT images showed promise in predicting the prognosis of NSCLC, although well-designed studies and further biological validation are still needed. • Peritumoral radiomics features based on CT images are promising and encouraging for predicting the prognosis of non-small cell lung cancer. • The peritumoral region was often dilated from the tumor boundary of 15 mm or 20 mm because these were considered safe margins. • The median Radiomics Quality Score of the included studies was 13 (range 4-19), and all of studies were considered to have a high risk of bias overall.",1899

36302172,Meta-Analysis of the Test-Retest Repeatability of [18F]-Fluorodeoxyglucose Standardized Uptake Values: Implications for Assessment of Tumor Response.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,2023,"Currently, guidelines for PET with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG-PET) interpretation for assessment of therapy response in oncology primarily involve visual evaluation of FDG-PET/CT scans. However, quantitative measurements of the metabolic activity in tumors may be even more useful in evaluating response to treatment. Guidelines based on such measurements, including the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Criteria and PET Response Criteria in Solid Tumors, have been proposed. However, more rigorous analysis of response criteria based on FDG-PET measurements is needed to adopt regular use in practice. Well-defined boundaries of repeatability and reproducibility of quantitative measurements to discriminate noise from true signal changes are a needed initial step. An extension of the meta-analysis from de Langen and colleagues (2012) of the test-retest repeatability of quantitative FDG-PET measurements, including mean, maximum, and peak standardized uptake values (SUVmax, SUVmean, and SUVpeak, respectively), was performed. Data from 11 studies in the literature were used to estimate the relationship between the variance in test-retest measurements with uptake level and various study-level, patient-level, and lesion-level characteristics. Test-retest repeatability of percentage fluctuations for all three types of SUV measurement (max, mean, and peak) improved with higher FDG uptake levels. Repeatability in all three SUV measurements varied for different lesion locations. Worse repeatability in SUVmean was also associated with higher tumor volumes. On the basis of these results, recommendations regarding SUV measurements for assessing minimal detectable changes based on repeatability and reproducibility are proposed. These should be applied to differentiate between response categories for a future set of FDG-PET-based criteria that assess clinically significant changes in tumor response.",1937

However, assessment from radiologic images of the specific pathologic lesion subtypes, as detailed in the results of biopsy procedures, remains a challenge. Purpose To develop an AI-based model to identify breast lesion subtypes with mammograms and linked electronic health records labeled with histopathologic information. Materials and Methods In this retrospective study, 26 569 images were collected in 9234 women who underwent digital mammography to pretrain the algorithms. The training data included individuals who had at least 1 year of clinical and imaging history followed by biopsy-based histopathologic diagnosis from March 2013 to November 2018. A model that combined convolutional neural networks with supervised learning algorithms was independently trained to make breast lesion predictions with data from 2120 women in Israel and 1642 women in the United States. Results were reported using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) with the 95% DeLong approach to estimate CIs. Significance was tested with bootstrapping. Results The Israeli model was validated in 456 women and tested in 441 women (mean age, 51 years ± 11 [SD]). The U.S. model was validated in 350 women and tested in 344 women (mean age, 60 years ± 12). For predicting malignancy in the test sets (consisting of 220 Israeli patient examinations and 126 U.S. patient examinations with ductal carcinoma in situ or invasive cancer), the algorithms obtained an AUC of 0.88 (95% CI: 0.85, 0.91) and 0.80 (95% CI: 0.74, 0.85) for Israeli and U.S. patients, respectively (",1707

In this retrospective observer study, four radiologists were asked to classify Breast Imaging-Reporting and Data System 4 (BI-RADS4) lesions (n = 101 benign, n = 99 malignant). The effect of different types of AI-based assistance (occlusion-based interpretability map, classification, and certainty) on the radiologists' performance (sensitivity, specificity, questionnaire) were measured. The influence of the Big Five personality traits was analyzed using the Pearson correlation. Diagnostic accuracy was significantly improved by AI-based assistance (an increase of 2.8% ± 2.3%, 95 %-CI 1.5 to 4.0 %, p = 0.045) and trust in the algorithm was generated primarily by the certainty of the prediction (100% of participants). Different human-AI interactions were observed ranging from nearly no interaction to humanization of the algorithm. High scores in neuroticism were correlated with higher persuasibility (Pearson's r = 0.98, p = 0.02), while higher consciousness and change of accuracy showed an inverse correlation (Pearson's r = -0.96, p = 0.04). Trust in the algorithm's performance was mostly dependent on the certainty of the predictions in combination with a plausible heatmap. Human-AI interaction varied widely and was influenced by personality traits. • AI-based assistance significantly improved the diagnostic accuracy of radiologists in classifying BI-RADS 4 mammography lesions. • Trust in the algorithm's performance was mostly dependent on the certainty of the prediction in combination with a reasonable heatmap. • Personality traits seem to influence human-AI collaboration.

36282309,Development and external validation of a multiparametric MRI-based radiomics model for preoperative prediction of microsatellite instability status in rectal cancer: a retrospective multicenter study.,European radiology,2023,"To establish and validate a radiomics model based on multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and to predict microsatellite instability (MSI) status in rectal cancer patients. A total of 199 patients with pathologically confirmed rectal cancer were included. The MSI status was confirmed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining. Clinical factors and laboratory data associated with MSI status were analyzed. The imaging data of 100 patients from one of the hospitals were used as the training set. The remaining 99 patients from the other two hospitals were used as the external validation set. The regions of interest (ROIs) were delineated from T1-weighted imaging (T1WI), T2-weighted imaging (T2WI), diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), and contrast-enhanced T1WI (CE-T1WI) sequence to extract the radiomics features. The Tree-based approach was used for feature selection. The models were constructed based on the four single sequences and a combination of the four sequences using the random forest (RF) algorithm. The external validation set was used to verify the generalization ability of each model. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and the area under the curve (AUC) were plotted to evaluate and compare the predictive performance of each model. In the four single-series models, the CE-T1WI model performed the best. The AUCs of the T1WI, T2WI, DWI, and CE-T1WI prediction models in the training set were 0.74, 0.71, 0.71, and 0.78, respectively, while in the external validation set, the corresponding AUCs were 0.67, 0.66, 0.70, and 0.77. The prediction and generalization performance of the combined model of multi-sequences was comparable to that of the CE-T1WI model and it was better than that of the remaining three single-series models, with AUC values of 0.78 and 0.78 in the training and validation sets, respectively. The established radiomics models based on CE-T1WI or multiparametric MRI have similar predictive performance. They have the potential to predict MSI status in rectal cancer patients. • A radiomics model for the prediction of MSI status in patients with rectal cancer was established and validated using external validation. • The models based on CE-T1WI or multiparametric MRI have better predictive performance than those based on single unenhanced sequence images. • The radiomics model has the potential to suggest MSI status in rectal cancer patients; however, it is not yet a substitute for histological confirmation.",2485

Late effects associated with radiotherapy include increased risk of second cancer and cardiovascular disease. We tested a positron emission tomography (PET)-adapted approach in patients with bulky, early-stage cHL, omitting radiotherapy in patients with interim PET-negative (PET-) disease and intensifying treatment in patients with PET-positive (PET+) disease. Eligible patients with bulky disease (mass > 10 cm or 1/3 the maximum intrathoracic diameter on chest x-ray) received two cycles of doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine (ABVD) followed by interim fluorodeoxyglucose PET (PET2). Patients with PET2-, defined as 1-3 on the 5-point scale, received four additional cycles of doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine. Patients with PET2+ received four cycles of escalated bleomycin, etoposide, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, procarbazine, and prednisone followed by 30.6 Gy involved-field radiation. Of 94 evaluable patients, 53% were female with median age 30 years (range, 18-58 years). Eight-five (90%) had stage II disease, including 48 (51%) with stage IIB/IIBE.

36269371,Evaluating prostate cancer bone metastasis using accelerated whole-body isotropic 3D T1-weighted Dixon MRI with compressed SENSE: a feasibility study.,European radiology,2023,"The study aimed to assess the efficiency of whole-body high-resolution compressed sensing-sensitivity encoding isotropic T1-Weighted Dixon (CSI-T1W-Dixon) scans in evaluating bone metastasis. Forty-five high-risk prostate cancer patients with bone metastases were enrolled prospectively and underwent whole-body MRI sequences, which included the following: pre- and post-contrast CSI-T1W-Dixon and conventional multi-planar T1-Weighted Dixon (CMP-T1W-Dixon) (coronal, sagittal, and axial scans), short tau inversion recovery (STIR), and DWI. Comparison between the CMP-T1W-Dixon and CSI-T1W-Dixon images was done for the subjective image quality, the quantitative contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Furthermore, the diagnostic performance based on per-lesion and per-patient basis utilizing non-contrast T1-weighted (T1)/T1+ contrasted T1-weighted (T1C)/T1 + T1C + STIR + DWI sequences was compared between the CSI-T1W-Dixon and CMP-T1W-Dixon methods using reference standards (combining biopsy data and 6-month imaging follow-up). The CSI-T1W-Dixon images produced fewer image artifacts in the axial and coronal planes compared to the CMP-T1W-Dixon images. Also, the CSI-T1W-Dixon images provided better a CNR in fat-only images of all three planes and water-only images of the axial plane (p < 0.05). The CSI-T1W-Dixon showed a higher sensitivity than the CMP-T1W-Dixon techniques in analyzing T1-only images on a per-lesion basis (82.7% vs. 53.8% for sensitivity, p = 0.03). On a per-patient basis, no difference was found in the diagnostic capacity between the CSI-T1W-Dixon and CMP-T1W-Dixon sequences either alone or in combinations (p = 0.57-1). High-resolution CSI-T1W-Dixon with higher image quality and diagnostic capacity can replace the CMP-T1W-Dixon method in evaluating bone metastasis in clinical practice. • Compressed sensing isotropic acquisition for 3D T1-weighted Dixon images can improve the image quality with fewer artifacts compared to the anisotropic multiplanar acquisition. • Compressed sensing isotropic acquisition can save 67% of scanning time compared to anisotropic multiplanar acquisition. • Compressed sensing isotropic 3D T1-weighted Dixon images can offer better diagnostic performance with higher sensitivity compared to anisotropic multiplanar images.",2318

Digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT), increasingly replacing MAM in practice, was also examined. Life years (LYs), quality-adjusted LYs (QALYs) With 100% screening adherence, annual BC screening extended LYs by 0.34-0.46 years over no screening. If the willingness-to-pay threshold to gain a quality-adjusted LY was ICER < $100,000 USD, annual MAM at age 25-74 years was the only cost-effective strategy. When nonadherence was taken into consideration, only annual MAM at age 30-74 years (ICER = $56,972 USD) was cost-effective. Supplementing annual MAM with MRI costing $545 USD was not cost-effective under either adherence condition. If MRI costs were reduced to $300 USD, adding MRI to annual MAM at age 30-74 years could become more cost-effective, particularly in the reduced adherence condition (ICER = $133,682 USD). Annual BC screening using MAM at age 30-74 years is effective and cost-effective in female chest-irradiated HL survivors. Although annual adjunct MRI is not cost-effective at $545 USD cost, it could become cost-effective as MRI cost is reduced, a plausible scenario with the emergent use of abbreviated MRI.",1407

This retrospective study enrolled 178 patients with cancer history from three medical centres categorised as those with adrenal lipid-poor benign lesions or metastases. Patients were divided into training, validation, and external testing cohorts. Radiomics features were extracted from triphasic CT images (unenhanced, arterial, and venous) to establish three single-phase models and one triphasic radiomics model using logistic regression. Unenhanced and triphasic nomograms were established by incorporating significant clinico-radiological factors and radscores. The models were evaluated by the receiver operating characteristic curve, Delong's test, calibration curve, and decision curve. Lesion side, diameter, and enhancement ratio resulted as independent factors and were selected into nomograms. The areas under the curves (AUCs) of unenhanced and triphasic radiomics models in validation (0.878, 0.914, p = 0.381) and external testing cohorts (0.900, 0.893, p = 0.882) were similar and higher than arterial and venous models (validation: 0.842, 0.765; testing: 0.814, 0.806). Unenhanced and triphasic nomograms yielded similar AUCs in validation (0.903, 0.906, p = 0.955) and testing cohorts (0.928, 0.946, p = 0.528). The calibration curves showed good agreement and decision curves indicated satisfactory clinical benefits. Unenhanced and triphasic CT-based radiomics nomograms resulted as a useful tool to differentiate adrenal lipid-poor benign lesions from metastases in a cancer population. They exhibited similar predictive efficacies, indicating that enhanced examinations could be avoided in special populations. • All four radiomics models and two nomograms using triphasic CT images exhibited favourable performances in three cohorts to characterise the cancer population's adrenal benign lesions and metastases. • Unenhanced and triphasic radiomics models had similar predictive performances, outperforming arterial and venous models. • Unenhanced and triphasic nomograms also exhibited similar efficacies and good clinical benefits, indicating that contrast-enhanced examinations could be avoided when identifying adrenal benign lesions and metastases.",2333
36264311,A signature of structural MRI features at 3 Tesla allows an accurate characterization of orbital cavernous venous malformation.,European radiology,2023,"To differentiate OCVM from other orbital lesions using structural MRI. This IRB-approved a historical-prospective cohort single-center analysis of a prospective cohort that included consecutive adult patients presenting with an orbital lesion undergoing a 3T MRI before surgery from December 2015 to May 2021. Two readers blinded to all data read all MRIs assessing structural MRI characteristics. A univariate analysis followed by a stepwise multivariate analysis identified structural MRI features showing the highest sensitivity and specificity when diagnosing OCVM. One hundred ninety-one patients with 30/191 (16%) OCVM and 161/191 (84%) other orbital lesions were included. OCVM were significantly more likely to present with a higher signal intensity than that of the cortex on T2WI: 26/29 (89.7%) versus 28/160 (17.5%), p < 0.001, or with a chemical shift artifact (CSA): 26/29 (89.7%) versus 16/155 (10.3%), p < 0.001, or to present with a single starting point of enhancement, as compared to other orbital lesions: 18/29 (62.1%) versus 4/159 (2.5%), p = 0.001. The step-wise analysis identified 2 signatures increasing performances. Signature 1 combined a higher signal intensity than that of the cortex on T2WI and a CSA. Signature 2 included these two features and the presence of a single starting point of enhancement. Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were 0.83, 0.94, and 0.92 for signature 1 and 0.97, 0.93, and 0.93 for signature 2, respectively. Structural MRI yields high sensitivity and specificity when diagnosing OCVM. • Structural MRI shows high sensitivity and specificity when diagnosing orbital cavernous venous malformation. • We identified two signatures combining structural MRI features which might be used easily in routine clinical practice. • The combination of higher signal intensity of the lesion as compared to the cortex on T2WI and of a chemical shift artifact yields a sensitivity and specificity of 0.83 and 0.94 for the diagnosis of orbital cavernous venous malformation, respectively.",2033
36242633,Vessel size and perfusion-derived vascular habitat refines prediction of treatment failure to bevacizumab in recurrent glioblastomas: validation in a prospective cohort.,European radiology,2023,"Anti-angiogenic therapy may not benefit all patients with recurrent glioblastomas, and imaging biomarker predicting treatment response to anti-angiogenic therapy is currently limited. We aimed to develop and validate vascular habitats based on perfusion and vessel size to predict time to progression (TTP) in patients with recurrent glioblastomas treated with bevacizumab. Sixty-nine patients with recurrent glioblastomas treated with bevacizumab who underwent pretreatment MRI with dynamic susceptibility contrast imaging and vessel architectural imaging were enrolled. Vascular habitats were constructed using vessel size index (VSI) and relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV). Associations with vascular habitats and TTP were analyzed using Cox proportional hazard regression analysis. In a prospectively enrolled validation cohort consisting of 15 patients ( ClinicalTrials.gov identifier; NCT04143425), stratification of TTP was demonstrated by the Kaplan-Meier method (log-rank test) using vascular habitats. Three vascular habitats consisting of high, intermediate, and low angiogenic habitats were identified with rCBV and VSI. Both high angiogenic and intermediate angiogenic habitats were significantly associated with a shorter TTP (hazard ratio [HR], 2.78 and 1.82, respectively; largest p = .003) and so was rCBV (HR, 2.15; p = .02). Concordance probability index of vascular habitat combining high and intermediate angiogenic habitats was 0.74. Vascular habitats stratified patients as good or poor responder in a prospective cohort (p = .059). Perfusion- and vessel size-derived vascular habitats predicted TTP in recurrent glioblastomas treated with anti-angiogenic therapy and aided patient stratification in a prospective validation cohort. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04143425 KEY POINTS: • High and intermediate angiogenic habitats predicted TTP in recurrent glioblastomas treated with anti-angiogenic therapy. • Vascular habitats combining high and intermediate angiogenic habitats aided patient stratification for anti-angiogenic therapy in recurrent glioblastomas.",2093

A total of 217 patients with HNSCC who underwent CECT scans and immunohistochemical examination of their Ki-67 index were enrolled in this study. The patients were divided into a training set (n = 140; Ki-67: ≥ 50% [n = 72] and < 50% [n = 68]) and an external test set (n = 77; Ki-67: ≥ 50% [n = 38] and < 50% [n = 39]). The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator method was used to select key features for a CECT-image-based radiomics signature and a radiomics score (Rad-score) was calculated. A clinical model was established using clinical data and CT findings. The independent clinical factors and Rad-score were then combined to construct a radiomics nomogram. The performance characteristics of the Rad-score, clinical model, and nomogram were assessed using ROCs and decision curve analysis. Twenty features were finally selected to construct the Rad-score. The radiomics nomogram incorporating the Rad-score, low histological grade, and lymphatic spread showed higher predictive value for the Ki-67 index (≥ 50% vs. < 50%) than the clinical model on both the training (AUC, 0.919 vs. 0.648, p < 0.001) and test (AUC, 0.832 vs. 0.685, p = 0.030) sets. Decision curve analysis demonstrated that the radiomics nomogram was more clinically useful than the clinical model. A CECT-based radiomics nomogram was constructed to predict the expression of Ki-67 in HNSCC. This model showed favorable predictive efficacy and might be useful for prognostic evaluation and clinical decision-making in patients with HNSCC. • Accurate pre-treatment prediction of Ki-67 index in HNSCC is crucial. • A CECT-based radiomics nomogram showed favorable predictive efficacy in estimation of Ki-67 expression status in HNSCC patients.",1910

From 2015 to 2019, a total of 161 patients with LARC were enrolled and randomly sampled into a training set (n = 113) and validation set (n = 48). Multi b-value DWI (b = 0~1500 s/mm Multivariate COX analysis revealed that DWI_score was an independent indicator for 5-year progression-free survival (PFS, HR = 5.573, p < 0.001), but not for overall survival (OS, HR = 2.177, p = 0.051). No mean value of functional parameters was correlated with PFS or OS. Prognostic model for 5-year PFS based on DWI_score, TNM-stage, mesorectal fascia (MRF), and extramural venous invasion (EMVI) showed good performance both in the training set (AUC = 0.819) and validation set (AUC = 0.815). The DWI_score based on histogram features of multi b-value DWI functional parameters was an independent factor for PFS of LARC and the prognostic model with a combination of DWI_score and clinicopathologic factors could indicate the progression risk before treatment. • Mean value of functional parameters obtained from multi b-value DWI might not be useful to assess the prognosis of LARC. • The DWI_score based on histogram features of multi b-value DWI functional parameters was an independent prognosis factor for PFS of LARC. • Prognostic model based on DWI_score and clinicopathologic factors could indicate the progression risk of LARC before treatment.",1470

Purpose To investigate ILA prevalence in an Asian health screening cohort and determine rates and risks for ILA progression, lung cancer development, and mortality within the 10-year follow-up. Materials and Methods This observational, retrospective multicenter study included patients aged 50 years or older who underwent chest CT at three health screening centers over a 4-year period (2007-2010). ILA status was classified as none, equivocal ILA, and ILA (nonfibrotic or fibrotic). Progression was evaluated from baseline to the last follow-up CT examination, when available. The log-rank test was performed to compare mortality rates over time between ILA statuses. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess factors associated with hazards of ILA progression, lung cancer development, and mortality. Results Of the 2765 included patients (mean age, 59 years ± 7 [SD]; 2068 men), 94 (3%) had a finding of ILA (35 nonfibrotic and 59 fibrotic ILA) and 119 (4%) had equivocal ILA. The median time for CT follow-up and the entire observation was 8 and 12 years, respectively. ILA progression was observed in 80% (48 of 60) of patients with ILA over 8 years.

36219114,Relationship between Race and Access to Newer Mammographic Technology in Women with Medicare Insurance.,Radiology,2023,"Background Racial disparities in breast cancer mortality have been reported. Mammographic technology has undergone two major technology transitions since 2000: first, the transition from screen-film mammography (SFM) to full-field digital mammography (FFDM) and second, the transition to digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT). Purpose To examine the relationship between use of newer mammographic technology and race in women receiving mammography services. Materials and Methods This was a multiyear (January 2005 to December 2020) retrospective study of women aged 40-89 years with Medicare fee-for-service insurance who underwent mammography. Data were obtained using a 5% research identifiable sample of all Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries. Within-institution and comparable-institution use of mammographic technology between Black women or women of other races and White women were assessed with multivariable logistic and linear regression, respectively, adjusted for age, race, Charlson comorbidity index, per capita income, urbanicity, and institutional capability. Results Between 2005 and 2020, there were 4 028 696 institutional mammography claims for women (mean age, 72 years ± 8 [SD]).

Purpose To compare the invasive breast cancer detection rate (iCDR) of DBT plus SM versus DM screening for different breast density categories. Materials and Methods An exploratory subanalysis of the TOmosynthesis plus SYnthesized MAmmography (TOSYMA) study, a randomized, controlled, multicenter, parallel-group trial recruited within the German mammography screening program from July 2018 to December 2020. Women aged 50-69 years were randomly assigned (1:1) to DBT plus SM or DM screening examination. Breast density categories A-D were visually assessed according to the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System Atlas. Exploratory analyses were performed of the iCDR in both study arms and stratified by breast density, and odds ratios and 95% CIs were determined. Results A total of 49 762 women allocated to DBT plus SM and 49 796 allocated to DM (median age, 57 years [IQR, 53-62 years]) were included. In the DM arm, the iCDR was 3.6 per 1000 screening examinations in category A (almost entirely fatty) (16 of 4475 screenings), 4.3 in category B (102 of 23 534 screenings), 6.1 in category C (116 of 19 051 screenings), and 2.3 in category D (extremely dense breasts) (six of 2629 screenings). The iCDR in the DBT plus SM arm was 2.7 per 1000 screening examinations in category A (12 of 4439 screenings), 6.9 in category B (154 of 22 328 screenings), 8.3 in category C (156 of 18 772 screenings), and 8.1 in category D (32 of 3940 screenings). The odds ratio for DM versus DBT plus SM in category D was 3.8 (95% CI: 1.5, 11.1). The invasive cancers detected with DBT plus SM were most often grade 2 tumors; in category C, it was 58% (91 of 156 invasive cancers), and in category D, it was 47% (15 of 32 invasive cancers). Conclusion The TOmosynthesis plus SYnthesized MAmmography trial revealed higher invasive cancer detection rates with digital breast tomosynthesis plus synthesized mammography than digital mammography in dense breasts, relatively and absolutely most marked among women with extremely dense breasts.

36194109,MRI Evaluation of Uterine Masses for Risk of Leiomyosarcoma: A Consensus Statement.,Radiology,2023,"Laparoscopic myomectomy, a common gynecologic operation in premenopausal women, has become heavily regulated since 2014 following the dissemination of unsuspected uterine leiomyosarcoma (LMS) throughout the pelvis of a physician treated for symptomatic leiomyoma. Research since that time suggests a higher prevalence than previously suspected of uterine LMS in resected masses presumed to represent leiomyoma, as high as one in 770 women (0.13%). Though rare, the dissemination of an aggressive malignant neoplasm due to noncontained electromechanical morcellation in laparoscopic myomectomy is a devastating outcome. Gynecologic surgeons' desire for an evidence-based, noninvasive evaluation for LMS is driven by a clear need to avoid such harms while maintaining the availability of minimally invasive surgery for symptomatic leiomyoma. Laparoscopic gynecologists could rely upon the distinction of higher-risk uterine masses preoperatively to plan oncologic surgery (ie, potential hysterectomy) for patients with elevated risk for LMS and, conversely, to safely offer women with no or minimal indicators of elevated risk the fertility-preserving laparoscopic myomectomy. MRI evaluation for LMS may potentially serve this purpose in symptomatic women with leiomyomas. This evidence review and consensus statement defines imaging and disease-related terms to allow more uniform and reliable interpretation and identifies the highest priorities for future research on LMS evaluation.",1484
36180645,Clinical value of contralateral breast cancers detected by pre-operative MRI in patients diagnosed with DCIS: a population-based cohort study.,European radiology,2023,"For patients with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), data about the impact of breast MRI at primary diagnosis on the incidence and characteristics of contralateral breast cancers are scarce. We selected all 8486 women diagnosed with primary DCIS in the Netherlands in 2011-2015 from the Netherlands Cancer Registry. The synchronous and metachronous detection of contralateral DCIS (cDCIS) and contralateral invasive breast cancer (cIBC) was assessed for patients who received an MRI upon diagnosis (MRI group) and for an age-matched control group without MRI. Nineteen percent of patients received an MRI, of which 0.8% was diagnosed with synchronous cDCIS and 1.3% with synchronous cIBC not found by mammography. The 5-year cumulative incidence of synchronous plus metachronous cDCIS was higher for the MRI versus age-matched control group (2.0% versus 0.9%, p = 0.02) and similar for cIBC (3.5% versus 2.3%, p = 0.17). The increased incidence of cDCIS was observed in patients aged < 50 years (sHR = 4.22, 95% CI: 1.19-14.99), but not in patients aged 50-74 years (sHR = 0.89, 95% CI: 0.41-1.93). MRI at primary DCIS diagnosis detected additional synchronous cDCIS and cIBC, and was associated with a higher rate of metachronous cDCIS without decreasing the rate of metachronous cIBC. This finding was most evident in younger patients. • Magnetic resonance imaging at primary diagnosis of ductal carcinoma in situ detected an additional synchronous breast lesion in 2.1% of patients. • In patients aged younger than 50 years, the use of pre-operative MRI was associated with a fourfold increase in the incidence of a second contralateral DCIS without decreasing the incidence of metachronous invasive breast cancers up to 5 years after diagnosis. • In patients aged over 50 years, the use of pre-operative MRI did not result in a difference in the incidence of a second contralateral DCIS or metachronous invasive breast cancer.",1928

We evaluated 243 patients who underwent wash-out CT for a solid enhancing hyperattenuating (i.e., > 10 Hounsfield unit [HU]) adrenal mass of ≥ 1 to < 4 cm. Wash-out (absolute percentage wash-out [APW]; relative percentage wash-out [RPW]) and wash-in values (enhancement ratio [ER]; relative enhancement ratio [RER]) were analyzed by two independent readers. Diagnostic criteria of wash-out CT for adenoma were APW ≥ 60% or RPW ≥ 40% (conventional method). Three different criteria for wash-in CT were set: ER ≥ 3.0; RER ≥ 200%; and RER ≥ 210%. Concordance rate and inter-method agreement between wash-out and wash-in CT were investigated using Gwet's AC1. For all lesions, concordance rates between wash-out and wash-in CT were > 83%. AC1 between conventional method and ER ≥ 3.0 or between conventional method and RER ≥ 200% were identically 0.843 for reader 1 and 0.776 for reader 2. AC1 between conventional method and RER ≥ 210% were 0.780 for reader 1 and 0.737 for reader 2. For lesions of > 10 to ≤ 30 HU, concordance rates between wash-out and wash-in CT were > 89%. AC1 between conventional method and ER ≥ 3.0 or between conventional method and RER ≥ 200% were identically 0.914 for reader 1 and 0.866 for reader 2. AC1 between conventional method and RER ≥ 210% were 0.888 for reader 1 and 0.874 for reader 2. In approximately 90% of patients with a hyperattenuating adrenal lesion of ≥ 1 to < 4 cm and >10 to ≤ 30 HU, wash-out CT with 15-min contrast-enhanced images may be replaced by wash-in CT. • An enhancement ratio of ≥ 3.0 or a relative enhancement ratio of ≥ 200% appears to be appropriate as the threshold of wash-in computed tomography (CT) comprising unenhanced and 1-min contrast-enhanced CT. • Measurement of enhancement ratio or relative enhancement ratio was reproducible. • We found good agreement between wash-in and wash-out CT for determining whether hyperattenuating adrenal lesions of ≥ 1 to < 4 cm and >10 to ≤ 30 Hounsfield unit would be characterized as adenomas.",2192
36169691,Development and validation of a deep learning signature for predicting lymph node metastasis in lung adenocarcinoma: comparison with radiomics signature and clinical-semantic model.,European radiology,2023,"To develop and validate a deep learning (DL) signature for predicting lymph node (LN) metastasis in patients with lung adenocarcinoma. A total of 612 patients with pathologically-confirmed lung adenocarcinoma were retrospectively enrolled and were randomly divided into training cohort (n = 489) and internal validation cohort (n = 123). Besides, 108 patients were enrolled and constituted an independent test cohort (n = 108). Patients' clinical characteristics and CT semantic features were collected. The radiomics features were derived from contrast-enhanced CT images. The clinical-semantic model and radiomics signature were built to predict LN metastasis. Furthermore, Swin Transformer was adopted to develop a DL signature predictive of LN metastasis. Model performance was evaluated by area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, calibration curve, and decision curve analysis. The comparisons of AUC were conducted by the DeLong test. The proposed DL signature yielded an AUC of 0.948-0.961 across all three cohorts, significantly superior to both clinical-semantic model and radiomics signature (all p < 0.05). The calibration curves show that DL signature predicted probabilities fit well the actual observed probabilities of LN metastasis. DL signature gained a higher net benefit than both clinical-semantic model and radiomics signature. The incorporation of radiomics signature or clinical-semantic risk predictors failed to reveal an incremental value over the DL signature. The proposed DL signature based on Swin Transformer achieved a promising performance in predicting LN metastasis and could confer important information in noninvasive mediastinal LN staging and individualized therapeutic options. • Accurate prediction for lymph node metastasis is crucial to formulate individualized therapeutic options for patients with lung adenocarcinoma. • The deep learning signature yielded an AUC of 0.948-0.961 across all three cohorts in predicting lymph node metastasis, superior to both radiomics signature and clinical-semantic model. • The incorporation of radiomics signature or clinical-semantic risk predictors into deep learning signature failed to reveal an incremental value over deep learning signature.",2276
36169690,"A new discriminant strategy combined with four TIRADS screening procedures increases ultrasound diagnostic accuracy-focusing on ""wrong diagnostic"" thyroid nodules.",European radiology,2023,"To utilize the discrepancies of different TIRADS, including ACR-TIRADS, Kwak-TIRADS, C-TIRADS, and EU-TIRADS, to explore methods for improving ultrasound diagnostic accuracy. In total, 795 nodules with cytological or surgical pathology were included. All nodules were screened by the four TIRADS according to their diagnostic concordance (Screening procedures, SP). Discriminant strategy (DS) derived from predictor variables was combined with SP to construct the evaluation method (SP+DS). The diagnostic performance of the SP+DS method alone and its derivational methods and two-TIRADS combined tests was evaluated. A total of 86.8% (269/310) malignant nodules and 93.6% (365/390) benign cases diagnosed by the four TIRADS simultaneously were pathologically confirmed, while 12.0% (95/795) nodules could not be consistently diagnosed by them. The criteria of DS were that iso- or hyper-echogenicity nodules should be considered benign, while hypo- or marked hypo-echogenicity nodules malignant. For 95 inconsistently diagnosed nodules screened by at least two TIRADS, DS performed best with an accuracy of 79.0%, followed by Kwak-TIRADS (72.6%). In the overall sample, the sensitivity and AUC were highest for the SP+DS method compared to the four TIRADS (91.3%, 0.895). Combining ACR-TIRADS and Kwak-TIRADS via parallel test resulted in significant improvements in the sensitivity and AUC compared to ACR-TIRADS (89.2% vs. 81.4%, 0.889 vs. 0.863). Combining C-TIRADS and DS in serial resulted in the highest AUC (0.887), followed by Kwak-TIRADS (0.884), while EU-TIRADS was the lowest (0.879). For undetermined or suspected thyroid nodules, two-TIRADS combined tests can be used to improve diagnostic accuracy. Otherwise, considering the inconsistent diagnosis of two TIRADS may require attention to the echo characteristics to differentiate between benign and malignant nodules. • The discrepancies in the diagnostic performance of different TIRADS arise from their performance on inconsistently diagnosed nodules. • ACR-TIRADS improves sensitivity via combining with Kwak-TIRADS in parallel (from 81.4 to 89.2%), while C-TIRADS increases specificity via combining with EU-TIRADS in serial (from 80.9 to 85.7%). • If the diagnostic findings of two TIRADS are inconsistent, echo characteristics will be helpful for the differentiation of benign and malignant nodules with an accuracy of 79.0%.",2396

LUAD patients treated with EGFR-TKIs were retrospectively included from three independent institutes and divided into training and validation cohorts. Intratumoral and peritumoral features were extracted from time-serial non-contrast chest CT (including pre-therapy and first follow-up images); moreover, the percentage variation per unit time (day) was introduced to adjust for the different follow-up periods of each patient. Test-retest was performed to exclude irreproducible features, while the Boruta algorithm was used to select critical radiomics features. Radiomics signatures were constructed with random forest survival models in the training cohort and compared against baseline clinical characteristics through Cox regression and nonparametric testing of concordance indices (C-indices). The training cohort included 131 patients (74 women, 56.5%) from one institute and the validation cohort encompassed 41 patients (24 women, 58.5%) from two other institutes. The optimal signature contained 10 features and 7 were unit time feature variations. The comprehensive radiomics model outperformed the pre-therapy clinical characteristics in predicting PFS (training: 0.78, 95% CI: [0.72, 0.84] versus 0.55, 95% CI: [0.49, 0.62], p < 0.001; validation: 0.72, 95% CI: [0.60, 0.84] versus 0.54, 95% CI: [0.42, 0.66], p < 0.001). Radiomics signature derived from time-serial CT images demonstrated optimal prognostic performance of disease progression. This dynamic imaging biomarker holds the promise of monitoring treatment response and achieving personalized management. • The intrinsic tumor heterogeneity can be highly dynamic under the therapeutic effect of EGFR-TKI treatment, and the inevitable development of drug resistance may disrupt the duration of clinical benefit. Decision-making remained challenging in practice to detect the emergence of acquired resistance during the early response phase. • Time-serial CT-based radiomics signature integrating intra- and peritumoral features offered the potential to predict progression-free survival for LUAD patients treated with EGFR-TKIs. • The dynamic imaging signature allowed for prognostic risk stratification.",2410
36166087,Imaging features facilitate diagnosis of porto-sinusoidal vascular disorder.,European radiology,2023,"Porto-sinusoidal vascular disorder (PSVD) is a recently defined vascular liver disease. Since diagnosis remains challenging, we aimed to evaluate radiological features that are distinct between PSVD and cirrhosis. Clinical, laboratory, and radiological parameters (CT/MRI) of patients with histologically-confirmed PSVD vs. cirrhosis vs. non-cirrhotic parenchymal liver disease were retrospectively evaluated. Sixty-three PSVD, 155 cirrhosis, and 41 non-cirrhotic patients were included. As compared to cirrhosis, PSVD patients were younger and had lower HVPG, liver stiffness, and MELD. Routine clinical and imaging findings indicative of portal hypertension were similarly common. Intrahepatic portal tract abnormalities (49% vs. 15%; p < 0.001), FNH-like lesions (30% vs. 1%; p < 0.001), and abnormal liver morphology defined as peripheral parenchymal atrophy and compensatory hypertrophy of central segments (32% vs. 7%; p < 0.001) were significantly more common in PSVD patients. Hypertrophy of segment I (70% vs. 84%; p = 0.019), atrophy of segment IV (24% vs. 47%; p = 0.001), and nodular liver surface (22% vs. 89%; p < 0.001) were more common in patients with cirrhosis. In patients with gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI, we identified the distinct imaging feature of ""periportal hyperintensity"" in the hepatobiliary phase (HBP) in 42% of patients with PSVD (14/33) vs. 1% in cirrhosis (1/95) vs. 0% in non-cirrhotic controls (0/41); p < 0.001). Diagnosis of PSVD must be considered in younger patients presenting with clinical features of portal hypertension, portal tract abnormalities, and FNH-like lesions on CT/MRI. 'Periportal hyperintensity' in the HBP of gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI was identified as a specific radiological feature of PSVD. • Cross-sectional imaging can provide essential information to identify patients with porto-sinusoidal vascular disorder (PSVD). • Intrahepatic portal tract abnormalities, FNH-like lesions, and abnormal liver morphology are common in PSVD patients. • Periportal hyperintensity on the hepatobiliary phase of gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI seems to be specific for patients with PSVD.",2133

One hundred and five pediatric patients who underwent total-body PET/CT examination were enrolled and divided into the DxCT group (n = 47) and LDCT group (n = 58) according to their dose levels. The sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of PET/DxCT and PET/LDCT for detecting the involvement of lymph node, spleen, bone marrow, and other extranodal organs in pretreatment lymphoma were compared. ROC analysis was performed to evaluate the integral efficiency. The staging accuracies based on PET/DxCT and PET/LDCT were also evaluated. Dosimetry was calculated for DxCT and LDCT, and the reduction in the effective dose was estimated. In the diagnosis of nodal, splenic, bone marrow, and other extranodal involvement, the differences in sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV between PET/LDCT and PET/DxCT were not significant (all p values ∈ [0.332, 1.000]). Both modalities had accuracies above 90% and the ROC analysis indicated good or high efficiency in diagnosing all patterns of lymphoma involvement. PET/LDCT and PET/DxCT each had a staging accuracy of 89.7% and 89.4%, respectively. LDCT had a comparable image quality score with DxCT, with a significant increase in noise (p < 0.001) and a 66.1% reduction in effective dose. PET/LDCT allowed for a 66.1% CT effective dose reduction compared to PET/DxCT in pediatric lymphoma patients without compromising the diagnostic and staging efficacy. • Pediatric lymphoma patients can benefit from a reduced effective dose of PET/CT. • This retrospective study showed that the diagnostic and staging efficacies of PET/low-dose CT are comparable to those of PET/diagnostic-level CT, both with satisfactory efficiency in diagnosing all patterns of lymphoma involvement. • PET/low-dose CT allowed for a 66.1% CT effective dose reduction compared to PET/diagnostic-level CT.",2056

Purpose To perform a pilot study of the performance of a novel PBT system compared with conventional digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) in patients undergoing additional diagnostic imaging workup for breast lesions. Materials and Methods In a prospective study from June 2020 to March 2021, participants with suspicious breast lesions detected at screening DBT or MRI were recruited for additional PBT imaging before additional diagnostic workup or biopsy. In this pilot study, nine radiologists independently evaluated image quality and assessed the likelihood of lesion malignancy by retrospectively evaluating DBT and PBT images in two separate reading sessions. Image quality was rated subjectively using a Likert scale from 1 to 5. Areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUCs) were used to compare the lesion classification (malignant vs benign) performance of the radiologists. Results Images in 50 patients (mean age, 56 years ± 12 [SD]; 49 women) with 52 evaluable lesions (28 malignant) were assessed.

36152038,Contrast-enhanced lymphatic US can improve the preoperative diagnostic performance for sentinel lymph nodes in early breast cancer.,European radiology,2023,"To evaluate the preoperative diagnostic value of contrast-enhanced lymphatic ultrasound (CEUS) for the sentinel lymph node (SLN) status in early breast cancer. We prospectively recruited 102 consecutive patients with clinically node-negative early breast cancer from July 2021 to October 2021. All patients underwent conventional US and percutaneous CEUS examinations. The CEUS of SLNs were classified into four enhancement patterns: homogeneous (I), featured inhomogeneous (II), focal defect (III), and no enhancement (IV). The diagnostic performance of conventional US and CEUS for SLN metastasis was assessed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and decision curves. A total of 78 women were enrolled in this study, including 55, 18, and 5 patients with negative axilla, 1-2, and ≥ 3 metastastic SLNs pathologically, respectively. The identification rate of SLNs by CEUS was 100%. Patterns I and II can select 91.7% (44/48) of patients with disease-free axilla, while patterns III and IV had higher percentages of metastasis (65.2%, p < 0.001 and 57.1%, p < 0.002, respectively). For the SLN metastatic burden, 100% (48/48) of patients with pattern I/II had ≤ 2 metastatic SLNs. Compared with conventional US, the CEUS enhancement patterns showed significant improvement in diagnosing metastatic SLNs (0.813 vs 0.601, p < 0.001). CEUS had greater clinical benefits and correctly reclassified 48% of metastatic SLNs (p < 0.001) without sacrificing the classification accuracy of negative SLNs (p = 0.25), and could improve prediction accuracy by 0.42 (p < 0.001). CEUS demonstrated better diagnostic performance and greater clinical benefits than conventional US for the preoperative diagnosis of SLNs, showing its potential to select candidates for precluding axillary surgery in early breast cancer. • The homogeneous and featured inhomogeneous enhancement of SLNs are highly suggestive of negative LNs, while focal defect (p < 0.001) and no enhancement (p < 0.002) patterns had higher percentages of metastasis. • The proportion of SLNs with highly suspicious signs on conventional US increases as the type of enhancement pattern increases (no suspicious signs in pattern I/II, 34.8% in pattern III, and 85.7% in pattern IV). • Compared with conventional US, CEUS improved the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (0.813 vs. 0.601, p < 0.001) and had greater clinical benefits (IDI = 0.42, p < 0.001) for the diagnosis of axillary metastasis.",2478
36136107,The long-term course of subsolid nodules and predictors of interval growth on chest CT: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,European radiology,2023,"To calculate the pooled incidence of interval growth after long-term follow-up and identify predictors of interval growth in subsolid nodules (SSNs) on chest CT. A search of MEDLINE (PubMed), Cochrane Library, Web of Science Core Collection, and Embase was performed on November 08, 2021, for relevant studies. Patient information, CT scanner, and SSN follow-up information were extracted from each included study. A random-effects model was applied along with subgroup and meta-regression analyses. Study quality was assessed by the Newcastle-Ottawa scale, and publication bias was assessed by Egger's test. Of the 6802 retrieved articles, 16 articles were included and analyzed, providing a total of 2898 available SSNs. The pooled incidence of growth in the 2898 SSNs was 22% (95% confidence interval [CI], 15-29%). The pooled incidence of growth in the subgroup analysis of pure ground-glass nodules was 26% (95% CI: 12-39%). The incidence of SSN growth after 2 or more years of stability was only 5% (95% CI: 3-7%). An initially large SSN size was found to be the most frequent risk factor affecting the incidence of SSN growth and the time of growth. The pooled incidence of SSN growth was as high as 22%, with a 26% incidence reported for pure ground-glass nodules. Although the incidence of growth was only 5% after 2 or more years of stability, long-term follow-up is needed in certain cases. Moreover, the initial size of the SSN was the most frequent risk factor for growth. • Based on a meta-analysis of 2898 available subsolid nodules in the literature, the pooled incidence of growth was 22% for all subsolid nodules and 26% for pure ground-glass nodules. • After 2 or more years of stability on follow-up CT, the pooled incidence of subsolid nodule growth was only 5%. • Given the incidence of subsolid nodule growth, management of these lesions with long-term follow-up is preferred.",1899
36129224,Contextualizing the Role of Volumetric Analysis in Pulmonary Nodule Assessment: ,AJR. American journal of roentgenology,2023,"Pulmonary nodules are managed on the basis of their size and morphologic characteristics. Radiologists are familiar with assessing nodule size by measuring diameter using manually deployed electronic calipers. Size may also be assessed with 3D volumetric measurements (referred to as volumetry) obtained with software. Nodule size and growth are more accurately assessed with volumetry than on the basis of diameter, and the evidence supporting clinical use of volumetry has expanded, driven by its use in lung cancer screening nodule management algorithms in Europe. The application of volumetry has the potential to reduce recommendations for imaging follow-up of indeterminate solid nodules without impacting cancer detection. Although changes in scanning conditions and volumetry software packages can lead to variation in volumetry results, ongoing technical advances have improved the reliability of calculated volumes. Volumetry is now the primary method for determining size of solid nodules in the European lung cancer screening position statement and British Thoracic Society recommendations. The purposes of this article are to review technical aspects, advantages, and limitations of volumetry and, by considering specific scenarios, to contextualize the use of volumetry with respect to its importance in morphologic evaluation, its role in predicting malignancy in risk models, and its practical impact on nodule management. Implementation challenges and areas requiring further evidence are also highlighted.",1523
36125380,Association of Longitudinal Mammographic Breast Density Changes with Subsequent Breast Cancer Risk.,Radiology,2023,"Background Although Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) density classification has been used to assess future breast cancer risk, its reliability and validity are still debated in literature. Purpose To determine the association between overall longitudinal changes in mammographic breast density and breast cancer risk stratified by menopausal status. Materials and Methods In a retrospective cohort study using the Korean National Health Insurance Service database, women aged at least 40 years without a history of cancer who underwent three consecutive biennial mammographic screenings in 2009-2014 were followed up through December 2020. Participants were divided according to baseline breast density: fatty (BI-RADS categories a, b) versus dense (BI-RADS categories c, d) and then into subgroups on the basis of changes from the first to second and from second to third screenings. Women without change in breast density were used as the reference group. Main outcomes were incident breast cancer events, both invasive breast cancer and ductal carcinoma in situ. Cox proportion hazard regression was used to calculate the hazard ratio (HR) with adjustment for other covariables. Results Among 2 253 963 women (mean age, 59 years ± 9) there were 22 439 detected breast cancers. Premenopausal women with fatty breasts at the first screening had a higher risk of breast cancer as density increased in the second and third screenings (fatty-to-dense HR, 1.45 [95% CI: 1.27, 1.65]; dense-to-fatty HR, 1.53 [95% CI: 1.34, 1.74]; dense-to-dense HR, 1.93 [95% CI: 1.75, 2.13]). In premenopausal women with dense breasts at baseline, those in whom density continuously decreased had a 0.62-fold lower risk (95% CI: 0.56, 0.69). Similar results were observed in postmenopausal women, remaining significant after adjustment for baseline breast density or changes in body mass index (fatty-to-dense HR, 1.50 [95% CI: 1.39, 1.62]; dense-to-fatty HR, 1.42 [95% CI: 1.31, 1.53]; dense-to-dense HR, 1.62 [95% CI: 1.51, 1.75]). Conclusion In both premenopausal and postmenopausal women undergoing three consecutive biennial mammographic screenings, a consecutive increase in breast density augmented the future breast cancer risk whereas a continuous decrease was associated with a lower risk. © RSNA, 2022 ",2311

In this retrospective multicenter study, consecutive patients with resectable SCLM underwent upfront surgery between 2006 and 2015 (development cohort) and between 2006 and 2017 (validation cohort). In the development cohort, we developed and internally validated the post- and preoperative models using multivariable Cox regression with an FDG metabolic parameter (metastasis-to-primary-tumor uptake ratio [M/P ratio]) and clinicopathological variables as predictors. In the validation cohort, the models were externally validated for discrimination, calibration, and clinical usefulness. Model performance was compared with that of Fong's clinical risk score (FCRS). A total of 374 patients (59.1 ± 10.5 years, 254 men) belonged in the development cohort and 151 (60.3 ± 12.0 years, 94 men) in the validation cohort. The M/P ratio and nine clinicopathological predictors were included in the models. Both postoperative and preoperative models showed significantly higher discrimination than FCRS (p < .05) in the external validation (time-dependent AUC = 0.76 [95% CI 0.68-0.84] and 0.76 [0.68-0.84] vs. 0.65 [0.57-0.74], respectively). Calibration plots and decision curve analysis demonstrated that both models were well calibrated and clinically useful. The developed models are presented as a web-based calculator ( https://cpmodel.shinyapps.io/SCLM/ ) and nomograms. FDG metabolic parameter-based prognostic models are well-calibrated recurrence prediction models with good discriminative power. They can be used for accurate risk stratification in patients with SCLM. • In this multicenter study, we developed and validated prediction models for recurrence in patients with resectable synchronous colorectal cancer liver metastasis using a metabolic parameter from FDG PET-CT. • The developed models showed good predictive performance on external validation, significantly exceeding that of a pre-existing model. • The models may be utilized for accurate patient risk stratification, thereby aiding in therapeutic decision-making.",2302

The study enrolled 107 patients pathologically confirmed to have single cHCC-CCA according to the 2019 WHO classification. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to find the optimal cutoff value of HCC% based on overall survival (OS). The preoperative MR imaging features and clinicopathological findings were retrospectively evaluated and compared between the high HCC% and low HCC% groups. In total, 107 patients (mean age, males vs. females: 56.6 ± 10.7 years vs. 54.2 ± 12.8 years) were evaluated. Analysis of the relationship between HCC% and OS by ROC curve suggested that the optimal cutoff value was 65%, by which 51 (47.7%) patients were assigned to the high HCC% group. LI-RADS categorization (OR = 3.657, p = 0.006 vs. OR = 4.075, p = 0.004) and serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) >5 ng/mL (OR = 0.348, p = 0.089 vs. OR = 0.298, p = 0.040) were significant predictors for HCC% in cHCC-CCA in both univariate and multivariate analysis. cHCC-CCA patients with HCC components higher than 65% tend to exhibit better overall survival, and MRI-based LI-RADS categorization and serum CEA level are valuable for identifying HCC% in cHCC-CCA preoperatively. • cHCC-CCA patients with HCC components higher than 65% tend to exhibit better overall survival. • MRI-based LI-RADS categorization and serum CEA level were significant predictors for HCC% in cHCC-CCA in both univariate and multivariate analyses and valuable for identifying HCC% in cHCC-CCA preoperatively.",1799

It is helpful in investigating the mid-term grading efficacy and safety of MRgFUS, and possible risk factors in participants with painful bone metastases. This four-center prospective study enrolled 96 participants between June 2016 and May 2019 with painful bone metastases. The Numerical Rating Scale (NRS), Brief Pain Inventory-Quality of Life (BPI-QoL) score, morphine equivalent daily dose (MEDD), and the adverse events (AEs) were recorded before and at 1 week, 1 month, 2 months, and 3 months after MRgFUS. The repeated ANOVA tests were used to analyze the change in NRS and BPI-QoL, and logistic regression analysis was used to analyze the possible risk factors. A total of 82 participants completed the 3-month follow-up period. And 16 (19.5%) participants were complete responders (CR), 46 (56.1%) participants were effective responders (ER), and the other 20 (24.4%) participants were non-responders (NR).

36074262,Visual ensemble selection of deep convolutional neural networks for 3D segmentation of breast tumors on dynamic contrast enhanced MRI.,European radiology,2023,"To develop a visual ensemble selection of deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) for 3D segmentation of breast tumors using T1-weighted dynamic contrast-enhanced (T1-DCE) MRI. Multi-center 3D T1-DCE MRI (n = 141) were acquired for a cohort of patients diagnosed with locally advanced or aggressive breast cancer. Tumor lesions of 111 scans were equally divided between two radiologists and segmented for training. The additional 30 scans were segmented independently by both radiologists for testing. Three 3D U-Net models were trained using either post-contrast images or a combination of post-contrast and subtraction images fused at either the image or the feature level. Segmentation accuracy was evaluated quantitatively using the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and the Hausdorff distance (HD95) and scored qualitatively by a radiologist as excellent, useful, helpful, or unacceptable. Based on this score, a visual ensemble approach selecting the best segmentation among these three models was proposed. The mean and standard deviation of DSC and HD95 between the two radiologists were equal to 77.8 ± 10.0% and 5.2 ± 5.9 mm. Using the visual ensemble selection, a DSC and HD95 equal to 78.1 ± 16.2% and 14.1 ± 40.8 mm was reached. The qualitative assessment was excellent (resp. excellent or useful) in 50% (resp. 77%). Using subtraction images in addition to post-contrast images provided complementary information for 3D segmentation of breast lesions by CNN. A visual ensemble selection allowing the radiologist to select the most optimal segmentation obtained by the three 3D U-Net models achieved comparable results to inter-radiologist agreement, yielding 77% segmented volumes considered excellent or useful. • Deep convolutional neural networks were developed using T1-weighted post-contrast and subtraction MRI to perform automated 3D segmentation of breast tumors. • A visual ensemble selection allowing the radiologist to choose the best segmentation among the three 3D U-Net models outperformed each of the three models. • The visual ensemble selection provided clinically useful segmentations in 77% of cases, potentially allowing for a valuable reduction of the manual 3D segmentation workload for the radiologist and greatly facilitating quantitative studies on non-invasive biomarker in breast MRI.",2326

36069622,Breast cancer screening during the COVID-19 pandemic: moving from disparities to health equity.,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,2023,"The COVID-19 pandemic created unprecedented disruptions to routine health care in the United States. Screening mammography, a cornerstone of breast cancer control and prevention, was completely halted in the spring of 2020, and screening programs have continued to face challenges with subsequent COVID-19 waves. Although screening mammography rates decreased for all women during the pandemic, a number of studies have now clearly documented that reductions in screening have been greater for some populations than others. Specifically, minoritized women have been screened at lower rates than White women across studies, although the specific patterns of disparity vary depending on the populations and communities studied. We posit that these disparities are likely due to a variety of structural and contextual factors, including the differential impact of COVID-19 on communities. We also outline key considerations for closing gaps in screening mammography. First, practices, health systems, and communities must measure screening mammography use to identify whether gaps exist and which populations are most affected. Second, we propose that strategies to close disparities in breast cancer screening must be multifaceted, targeting the health system or practice, but also structural factors at the policy level. Health disparities arise from a complex set of conditions, and multimodal solutions that address the complex, multifactorial conditions that lead to disparities may be more likely to succeed and are necessary for promoting health equity.",1557

36066730,The longitudinal evolution of cerebral blood flow in children with tuberous sclerosis assessed by arterial spin labeling magnetic resonance imaging may be related to cognitive performance.,European radiology,2023,"To study longitudinal changes in tuber and whole-brain perfusion in children with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) using arterial spin labeling (ASL) perfusion MRI and correlate them with pathological EEG slow wave activity and neurodevelopmental outcomes. Retrospective longitudinal cohort study of 13 children with TSC, 3 to 6 serial ASL-MRI scans between 2 months and 7 years of age (53 scans in total), and an EEG examination performed within 2 months of the last MRI. Tuber cerebral blood flow (CBF) values were calculated in tuber segmentation masks, and tuber:cortical CBF ratios were used to study tuber perfusion. Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify which initial tuber characteristics (CBF value, volume, location) in the first MRI predicted tubers subsequently associated with EEG slow waves. Whole-brain and lobar CBF values were extracted for all patient scans and age-matched controls. CBF ratios were compared in patients and controls to study longitudinal changes in whole-brain CBF. Perfusion was reduced in tubers associated with EEG slow waves compared with other tubers. Low tuber CBF values around 6 months of age and large tuber volumes were predictive of tubers subsequently associated with EEG slow waves. Patients with severe developmental delay had more severe whole-brain hypoperfusion than those with no/mild delay, which became apparent after 2 years of age and were not associated with a higher tuber load. Dynamic changes in tuber and brain perfusion occur over time. Perfusion is significantly reduced in tubers associated with EEG slow waves. Whole-brain perfusion is significantly reduced in patients with severe delay. • Tubers associated with EEG slow wave activity were significantly more hypoperfused than other tubers, especially after 1 year of age. • Larger and more hypoperfused tubers at 6 months of age were more likely to subsequently be associated with pathological EEG slow wave activity. • Patients with severe developmental delay had more extensive and severe global hypoperfusion than those without developmental delay.",2088
36066369,Artificial Intelligence to Predict Lymph Node Metastasis at CT in Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma.,Radiology,2023,"Background Although deep learning has brought revolutionary changes in health care, reliance on manually selected cross-sectional images and segmentation remain methodological barriers. Purpose To develop and validate an automated preoperative artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm for tumor and lymph node (LN) segmentation with CT imaging for prediction of LN metastasis in patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Materials and Methods In this retrospective study, patients with surgically resected, pathologically confirmed PDAC underwent multidetector CT from January 2015 to April 2020. Three models were developed, including an AI model, a clinical model, and a radiomics model. CT-determined LN metastasis was diagnosed by radiologists. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was conducted to develop the clinical and radiomics models. The performance of the models was determined on the basis of their discrimination and clinical utility. Kaplan-Meier curves, the log-rank test, or Cox regression were used for survival analysis. Results Overall, 734 patients (mean age, 62 years ± 9 [SD]; 453 men) were evaluated. All patients were split into training (",1182
36066364,Photon-counting Detector CT with Deep Learning Noise Reduction to Detect Multiple Myeloma.,Radiology,2023,"Background Photon-counting detector (PCD) CT and deep learning noise reduction may improve spatial resolution at lower radiation doses compared with energy-integrating detector (EID) CT. Purpose To demonstrate the diagnostic impact of improved spatial resolution in whole-body low-dose CT scans for viewing multiple myeloma by using PCD CT with deep learning denoising compared with conventional EID CT. Materials and Methods Between April and July 2021, adult participants who underwent a whole-body EID CT scan were prospectively enrolled and scanned with a PCD CT system in ultra-high-resolution mode at matched radiation dose (8 mSv for an average adult) at an academic medical center. EID CT and PCD CT images were reconstructed with Br44 and Br64 kernels at 2-mm section thickness. PCD CT images were also reconstructed with Br44 and Br76 kernels at 0.6-mm section thickness. The thinner PCD CT images were denoised by using a convolutional neural network. Image quality was objectively quantified in two phantoms and a randomly selected subset of participants (10 participants; median age, 63.5 years; five men). Two radiologists scored PCD CT images relative to EID CT by using a five-point Likert scale to detect findings reflecting multiple myeloma. The scoring for the matched reconstruction series was blinded to scanner type. Reader-averaged scores were tested with the null hypothesis of equivalent visualization between EID and PCD. Results Twenty-seven participants (median age, 68 years; IQR, 61-72 years; 16 men) were included. The blinded assessment of 2-mm images demonstrated improvement in viewing lytic lesions, intramedullary lesions, fatty metamorphosis, and pathologic fractures for PCD CT versus EID CT (",1731
36048207,CT-based Bosniak classification of cystic renal lesions: is version 2019 an improvement on version 2005?,European radiology,2023,"To compare the diagnostic performance and inter-reader agreement of the CT-based v2019 versus v2005 Bosniak classification systems for risk stratification of cystic renal lesions (CRL). This retrospective study included adult patients with CRL identified on CT scan between 2005 and 2018. The reference standard was histopathology or a minimum 4-year imaging follow-up. The studies were reviewed independently by five readers (three senior, two junior), blinded to pathology results and imaging follow-up, who assigned Bosniak categories based on the 2005 and 2019 versions. Diagnostic performance of v2005 and v2019 Bosniak classifications for distinguishing benign from malignant lesions was calculated by dichotomizing CRL into the potential for ablative therapy (III-IV) or conservative management (I-IIF). Inter-reader agreement was calculated using Light's Kappa. One hundred thirty-nine patients with 149 CRL (33 malignant) were included. v2005 and v2019 Bosniak classifications achieved similar diagnostic performance with a sensitivity of 91% vs 91% and a specificity of 89% vs 88%, respectively. Inter-reader agreement for overall Bosniak category assignment was substantial for v2005 (κ = 0.78) and v2019 (κ = 0.75) between senior readers but decreased for v2019 when the Bosniak classification was dichotomized to conservative management (I-IIF) or ablative therapy (III-IV) (0.80 vs 0.71, respectively). For v2019, wall thickness was the morphological feature with the poorest inter-reader agreement (κ = 0.43 and 0.18 for senior and junior readers, respectively). No significant improvement in diagnostic performance and inter-reader agreement was shown between v2005 and v2019. The observed decrease in inter-reader agreement in v2019 when dichotomized according to management strategy may reflect the more stringent morphological criteria. • Versions 2005 and 2019 Bosniak classifications achieved similar diagnostic performance, but the specificity of higher risk categories (III and IV) was not increased while one malignant lesion was downgraded to v2019 Bosniak category II (i.e., not subjected to further follow-up). • Inter-reader agreement was similar between v2005 and v2019 but moderately decreased for v2019 when the Bosniak classification was dichotomized according to the potential need for ablative therapies (I-II-IIF vs III-IV).",2359
36040335,Background Parenchymal Enhancement at Postoperative Surveillance Breast MRI: Association with Future Second Breast Cancer Risk.,Radiology,2023,"Background Background parenchymal enhancement (BPE) is a known risk factor for breast cancer. However, studies on the association between BPE and second breast cancer risk are still lacking. Purpose To investigate whether BPE at surveillance breast MRI is associated with subsequent second breast cancer risk in women with a personal history of breast cancer. Materials and Methods A retrospective search of the imaging database of an academic medical center identified consecutive surveillance breast MRI examinations performed between January 2008 and December 2017 in women who underwent surgery for primary breast cancer and had no prior diagnosis of second breast cancer. BPE at surveillance breast MRI was qualitatively assessed using a four-category classification of minimal, mild, moderate, or marked. Future second breast cancer was defined as ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence or contralateral breast cancer diagnosed at least 1 year after each surveillance breast MRI examination. Factors associated with future second breast cancer risk were evaluated using the multivariable Fine-Gray subdistribution hazard model. Results Among the 2668 women (mean age at baseline surveillance breast MRI, 49 years ± 8 [SD]), 109 developed a second breast cancer (49 ipsilateral, 58 contralateral, and two ipsilateral and contralateral) at a median follow-up of 5.8 years.

Using interim  Initially, 205 DLBCL patients undergoing interim [ The final model with contrastive objective optimization, named the contrastive hybrid learning model, performed best, with an accuracy of 91.22% and an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.926, in the primary dataset. In the external dataset, its accuracy and AUC remained at 88.64% and 0.925, respectively, indicating its good generalization ability. The proposed model achieved good performance, validated the predictive value of interim PET/CT, and holds promise for directing individualized clinical treatment. • The proposed multimodal models achieved accurate prediction of primary treatment failure in DLBCL patients. • Using an appropriate feature-level fusion strategy can make the same class close to each other regardless of the modal heterogeneity of the data source domain and positively impact the prediction performance. • Deep learning validated the predictive value of interim PET/CT in a way that exceeded human capabilities.",1229
36029343,Distinct patterns of the natural evolution of soft tissue sarcomas on pre-treatment MRIs captured with delta-radiomics correlate with gene expression profiles.,European radiology,2023,"Radiomics of soft tissue sarcomas (STS) is assumed to correlate with histologic and molecular tumor features, but radiogenomics analyses are lacking. Our aim was to identify if distinct patterns of natural evolution of STS obtained from consecutive pre-treatment MRIs are associated with differential gene expression (DGE) profiling in a pathway analysis. All patients with newly diagnosed STS treated in a curative intent in our sarcoma reference center between 2008 and 2019 and with two available pre-treatment contrast-enhanced MRIs were included in this retrospective study. Radiomics features (RFs) were extracted from fat-sat contrast-enhanced T1-weighted imaging. Log ratio and relative change in RFs were calculated and used to determine grouping of samples based on a consensus hierarchical clustering. DGE and oncogenesis pathway analysis were performed in the delta-radiomics groups identified in order to detect associations between delta-radiomics patterns and transcriptomics features of STS. Secondarily, the prognostic value of the delta-radiomics groups was investigated. Sixty-three patients were included (median age: 63 years, interquartile range: 52.5-70). The consensus clustering identified 3 reliable delta-radiomics patient groups (A, B, and C). On imaging, group B patients were characterized by increase in tumor heterogeneity, necrotic signal, infiltrative margins, peritumoral edema, and peritumoral enhancement before the treatment start (p value range: 0.0019-0.0244), and, molecularly, by downregulation of natural killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity genes and upregulation of Hedgehog and Hippo signaling pathways. Group A patients were characterized by morphological stability of pre-treatment MRI traits and no local relapse (log-rank p = 0.0277). This study highlights radiomics and transcriptomics convergence in STS. Proliferation and immune response inhibition were hyper-activated in the STS that were the most evolving on consecutive imaging. • Three consensual and stable delta-radiomics clusters were identified and captured the natural patterns of morphological evolution of STS on pre-treatment MRIs. • These 3 patterns were explainable and correlated with different well-known semantic radiological features with an ascending gradient of pejorative characteristics from the A group to C group to B group. • Gene expression profiling stressed distinct patterns of up/downregulated oncogenetic pathways in STS from B group in keeping with its most aggressive radiological evolution.",2525
36018355,A systematic review of radiomics in chondrosarcoma: assessment of study quality and clinical value needs handy tools.,European radiology,2023,"To evaluate the study quality and clinical value of radiomics studies on chondrosarcoma. PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, and Wanfang Data were searched for articles on radiomics for evaluating chondrosarcoma as of January 31, 2022. The study quality was assessed according to Radiomics Quality Score (RQS), Transparent Reporting of a multivariable prediction model for Individual Prognosis Or Diagnosis (TRIPOD) checklist, Image Biomarker Standardization Initiative (IBSI) guideline, and modified Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) tool. The level of evidence supporting clinical use of radiomics on chondrosarcoma differential diagnosis was determined based on meta-analyses. Twelve articles were included. The median RQS was 10.5 (range, -3 to 15), with an adherence rate of 36%. The adherence rate was extremely low in domains of high-level evidence (0%), open science and data (17%), and imaging and segmentation (35%). The adherence rate of the TRIPOD checklist was 61%, and low for section of title and abstract (13%), introduction (42%), and results (56%). The reporting rate of pre-processing steps according to the IBSI guideline was 60%. The risk of bias and concern of application were mainly related to the index test. The meta-analysis on differential diagnosis of enchondromas vs. chondrosarcomas showed a diagnostic odds ratio of 43.90 (95% confidential interval, 25.33-76.10), which was rated as weak evidence. The current scientific and reporting quality of radiomics studies on chondrosarcoma was insufficient. Radiomics has potential in facilitating the optimization of operation decision-making in chondrosarcoma. • Among radiomics studies on chondrosarcoma, although differential diagnostic models showed promising performance, only pieces of weak level of evidence were reached with insufficient study quality. • Since the RQS rating, the TRIPOD checklist, and the IBSI guideline have largely overlapped with each other, it is necessary to establish one widely acceptable methodological and reporting guideline for radiomics research. • The TRIPOD model typing, the phase classification of image mining studies, and the level of evidence category are useful tools to assess the gap between academic research and clinical application, although their modifications for radiomics studies are needed.",2385
36001124,ITHscore: comprehensive quantification of intra-tumor heterogeneity in NSCLC by multi-scale radiomic features.,European radiology,2023,"To quantify intra-tumor heterogeneity (ITH) in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) from computed tomography (CT) images. We developed a quantitative ITH measurement-ITHscore-by integrating local radiomic features and global pixel distribution patterns. The associations of ITHscore with tumor phenotypes, genotypes, and patient's prognosis were examined on six patient cohorts (n = 1399) to validate its effectiveness in characterizing ITH. For stage I NSCLC, ITHscore was consistent with tumor progression from stage IA1 to IA3 (p < 0.001) and captured key pathological change in terms of malignancy (p < 0.001). ITHscore distinguished the presence of lymphovascular invasion (p = 0.003) and pleural invasion (p = 0.001) in tumors. ITHscore also separated patient groups with different overall survival (p = 0.004) and disease-free survival conditions (p = 0.005). Radiogenomic analysis showed that the level of ITHscore in stage I and stage II NSCLC is correlated with heterogeneity-related pathways. In addition, ITHscore was proved to be a stable measurement and can be applied to ITH quantification in head-and-neck cancer (HNC). ITH in NSCLC can be quantified from CT images by ITHscore, which is an indicator for tumor phenotypes and patient's prognosis. • ITHscore provides a radiomic quantification of intra-tumor heterogeneity in NSCLC. • ITHscore is an indicator for tumor phenotypes and patient's prognosis. • ITHscore has the potential to be generalized to other cancer types such as HNC.",1500
35999375,MRI features associated with HCC histologic subtypes: a western American and European bicenter study.,European radiology,2023,"To evaluate if preoperative MRI can predict the most frequent HCC subtypes in North American and European patients treated with surgical resection. A total of 119 HCCs in 97 patients were included in the North American group and 191 HCCs in 176 patients were included in the European group. Lesion subtyping was based on morphologic features and immuno-histopathological analysis. Two radiologists reviewed preoperative MRI and evaluated the presence of imaging features including LI-RADS major and ancillary features to identify clinical, biologic, and imaging features associated with the main HCC subtypes. Sixty-four percent of HCCs were conventional. The most frequent subtypes were macrotrabecular-massive (MTM-15%) and steatohepatitic (13%). Necrosis (OR = 3.32; 95% CI: 1.39, 7.89; p = .0064) and observation size (OR = 1.011; 95% CI: 1.0022, 1.019; p = .014) were independent predictors of MTM-HCC. Fat in mass (OR = 15.07; 95% CI: 6.57, 34.57; p < .0001), tumor size (OR = 0.97; 95% CI: 0.96, 0.99; p = .0037), and absence of chronic HCV infection (OR = 0.24; 95% CI: 0.084, 0.67; p = .0068) were independent predictors of steatohepatitic HCC. Independent predictors of conventional HCCs were viral C hepatitis (OR = 3.20; 95% CI: 1.62, 6.34; p = .0008), absence of fat (OR = 0.25; 95% CI: 0.12, 0.52; p = .0002), absence of tumor in vein (OR = 0.34; 95% CI: 0.13, 0.84; p = .020), and higher tumor-to-liver ADC ratio (OR = 1.96; 95% CI: 1.14, 3.35; p = .014) CONCLUSION: MRI is useful in predicting the most frequent HCC subtypes even in cohorts with different distributions of liver disease etiologies and tumor subtypes which might have future treatment and management implications. • Representation of both liver disease etiologies and HCC subtypes differed between the North American and European cohorts of patients. • Retrospective two-center study showed that liver MRI is useful in predicting the most frequent HCC subtypes.",1943
35999374,Novel 3D magnetic resonance fingerprinting radiomics in adult brain tumors: a feasibility study.,European radiology,2023,"To test the feasibility of using 3D MRF maps with radiomics analysis and machine learning in the characterization of adult brain intra-axial neoplasms. 3D MRF acquisition was performed on 78 patients with newly diagnosed brain tumors including 33 glioblastomas (grade IV), 6 grade III gliomas, 12 grade II gliomas, and 27 patients with brain metastases. Regions of enhancing tumor, non-enhancing tumor, and peritumoral edema were segmented and radiomics analysis with gray-level co-occurrence matrices and gray-level run-length matrices was performed. Statistical analysis was performed to identify features capable of differentiating tumors based on type, grade, and isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH1) status. Receiver operating curve analysis was performed and the area under the curve (AUC) was calculated for tumor classification and grading. For gliomas, Kaplan-Meier analysis for overall survival was performed using MRF T1 features from enhancing tumor region. Multiple MRF T1 and T2 features from enhancing tumor region were capable of differentiating glioblastomas from brain metastases. Although no differences were identified between grade 2 and grade 3 gliomas, differentiation between grade 2 and grade 4 gliomas as well as between grade 3 and grade 4 gliomas was achieved. MRF radiomics features were also able to differentiate IDH1 mutant from the wild-type gliomas. Radiomics T1 features for enhancing tumor region in gliomas correlated to overall survival (p < 0.05). Radiomics analysis of 3D MRF maps allows differentiating glioblastomas from metastases and is capable of differentiating glioblastomas from metastases and characterizing gliomas based on grade, IDH1 status, and survival. • 3D MRF data analysis using radiomics offers novel tissue characterization of brain tumors. • 3D MRF with radiomics offers glioma characterization based on grade, IDH1 status, and overall patient survival.",1909
35999373,Comparison of imaging findings of macrotrabecular-massive hepatocellular carcinoma using CT and gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI.,European radiology,2023,"To investigate the imaging findings of macrotrabecular-massive hepatocellular carcinoma (MTM-HCC) on CT and MRI, and examine their diagnostic performance and prognostic significance. We retrospectively enrolled 220 consecutive patients who underwent hepatic resection between June 2009 and December 2013 for single treatment-naïve HCC, who have preoperative CT and gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI. Independent reviews of histopathology and imaging were performed by two reviewers. Previously reported imaging findings, LI-RADS category, and CT attenuation of MTM-HCC were investigated. The diagnostic performance of the MTM-HCC diagnostic criteria was compared across imaging modalities. MTM-HCC was associated with ≥ 50% arterial phase hypovascular component, intratumoral artery, arterial phase peritumoral enhancement, and non-smooth tumor margin on CT and MRI (p < .05). Arterial phase hypovascular components were less commonly observed on MRI subtraction images than on CT or MRI, while non-rim arterial phase hyperenhancement and LR-5 were more commonly observed on MRI subtraction images than on MRI (p < .05). MTM-HCC showed lower tumor attenuation in the CT arterial phase (p = .01). Rhee's criteria, defined as ≥ 50% hypovascular component and ≥ 2 ancillary findings (intratumoral artery, arterial phase peritumoral enhancement, and non-smooth tumor margin), showed similar diagnostic performance for MRI (sensitivity, 41%; specificity, 97%) and CT (sensitivity, 31%; specificity, 94%). Rhee's criteria on CT were independent prognostic factors for overall survival. The MRI diagnostic criteria for MTM-HCC are applicable on CT, showing similar diagnostic performance and prognostic significance. For MTM-HCC, arterial phase subtraction images can aid in the HCC diagnosis by depicting subtle arterial hypervascularity. • MTM-HCC on CT demonstrated previously described MRI findings, including arterial phase hypovascular component, intratumoral artery, arterial phase peritumoral enhancement, and necrosis. • The MRI diagnostic criteria for MTM-HCC were also applicable to CT, showing comparable diagnostic performance and prognostic significance. • On arterial phase subtraction imaging, MTM-HCC more frequently demonstrated non-rim enhancement and LR-5 and less frequently LR-M than MRI arterial phase, which may aid in the diagnosis of HCC.",2351

MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched. Eligible studies contained patients with cystic renal masses undergoing CT or MRI renal protocol examinations with pathology confirmation, applying Bosniak v2019. Proportion of malignancy was estimated within Bosniak v2019 class. Risk of bias was assessed using QUADAS-2. We included 471 patients with 480 cystic renal masses. No class I malignant masses were observed. Pooled proportion of malignancy were class II, 12% (6/51, 95% CI 5-24%); class IIF, 46% (37/85, 95% CI 28-66%); class III, 79% (138/173, 95% CI 68-88%); and class IV, 84% (114/135, 95% CI 77-90%). Proportion of malignancy differed between Bosniak v2019 II-IV classes (p = 0.004). Four studies reported the proportion of malignancy by wall/septa feature. The pooled proportion of malignancy with 95% CI were class III thick smooth wall/septa, 77% (41/56, 95% CI 53-91%); class III obtuse protrusion ≤ 3 mm (irregularity), 83% (97/117, 95% CI 75-89%); and class IV nodule with acute angulation, 86% (50/58, 95% CI 75-93%) or obtuse angulation ≥ 4 mm, 83%, (64/77, 95% CI 73-90%). Subgroup analysis by wall/septa feature was limited by sample size; however, no differences were found comparing class III masses with irregularity to class IV masses (p = 0.74) or between class IV masses by acute versus obtuse angles (p = 0.62). Preliminary data suggest Bosniak v2019 class IIF masses have higher proportion of malignancy compared to the original classification, controlling for pathologic reference standard. There are no differences in proportion of malignancy comparing class III masses with irregularities to class IV masses with acute or obtuse nodules. • The proportion of malignancy in Bosniak v2019 class IIF cystic masses is 46% (37 malignant/85 total IIF masses, 95% confidence intervals (CI) 28-66%). • The proportion of malignancy in Bosniak v2019 class III cystic masses is 79% (138/173, 95% CI 68-88%) and in Bosniak v2019 class IV cystic masses is 84% (114/135, 95% CI 77-90%). • Class III cystic masses with irregularities had similar proportion of malignancy (83%, 97/117, 95% CI 75-89%) compared to Bosniak class IV masses (84%, 114/135, 95% CI 77-90%) overall (p = 0.74) with no difference within class IV masses by acute versus obtuse angulation (p = 0.62).",2346

Purpose To develop and validate a DL-based approach for automatic identification of patients with various solid and cystic pancreatic neoplasms at abdominal CT and compare its diagnostic performance with that of radiologists. Materials and Methods In this retrospective study, a three-dimensional nnU-Net-based DL model was trained using the CT data of patients who underwent resection for pancreatic lesions between January 2014 and March 2015 and a subset of patients without pancreatic abnormality who underwent CT in 2014. Performance of the DL-based approach to identify patients with pancreatic lesions was evaluated in a temporally independent cohort (test set 1) and a temporally and spatially independent cohort (test set 2) and was compared with that of two board-certified radiologists. Performance was assessed using receiver operating characteristic analysis. Results The study included 852 patients in the training set (median age, 60 years [range, 19-85 years]; 462 men), 603 patients in test set 1 (median age, 58 years [range, 18-82 years]; 376 men), and 589 patients in test set 2 (median age, 63 years [range, 18-99 years]; 343 men). In test set 1, the DL-based approach had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.91 (95% CI: 0.89, 0.94) and showed slightly worse performance in test set 2 (AUC, 0.87 [95% CI: 0.84, 0.89]).

35986774,Radiomics model-based algorithm for preoperative prediction of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma grade.,European radiology,2023,"To develop diagnostic radiomic model-based algorithm for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) grade prediction. Ninety-one patients with histologically confirmed PDAC and preoperative CT were divided into subgroups based on tumor grade. Two histology-blinded radiologists independently segmented lesions for quantitative texture analysis in all contrast enhancement phases. The ratio of densities of PDAC and unchanged pancreatic tissue, and relative tumor enhancement (RTE) in arterial, portal venous, and delayed phases of the examination were calculated. Principal component analysis was used for multivariate predictor analysis. The selection of predictors in the binary logistic model was carried out in 2 stages: (1) using one-factor logistic models (selection criterion was p < 0.1); (2) using regularization (LASSO regression after standardization of variables). Predictors were included in proportional odds models without interactions. There were significant differences in 4, 16, and 8 texture features out of 62 for the arterial, portal venous, and delayed phases of the study, respectively (p < 0.1). After selection, the final diagnostic model included such radiomics features as DISCRETIZED HU standard, DISCRETIZED HUQ3, GLCM Correlation, GLZLM LZLGE for the portal venous phase of the contrast enhancement, and CONVENTIONAL_HUQ3 for the delayed phase of CT study. On its basis, a diagnostic model was built, showing AUC for grade ≥ 2 of 0.75 and AUC for grade 3 of 0.66. Radiomics features vary in PDAC of different grades and increase the accuracy of CT in preoperative diagnosis. We have developed a diagnostic model, including texture features, which can be used to predict the grade of PDAC. • A diagnostic algorithm based on CT texture features for preoperative PDAC grade prediction was developed. • The assumption that the scanning protocol can influence the results of texture analysis was confirmed and assessed. • Our results show that tumor differentiation grade can be assessed with sufficient diagnostic accuracy using CT texture analysis presented in this study.",2096

Twenty-four patients with mandibular squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) who underwent MRI including CS-3D-T1TFE and MDCT examinations before surgery were retrospectively included. For both examinations, 0.5-mm-thick coronal plane images and 0.5-mm-thick plane images perpendicular and parallel to the dentition were constructed. Two radiologists rated bone invasion in three categories indexed by cortical bone, cancellous bone, and mandibular canal (MC), and inter-rater agreement was assessed by weighted kappa statistics. In 20 of the 24 patients who underwent surgery, the correlation of bone invasion with the histopathological evaluation by pathologists was assessed using Pearson's correlation coefficient. Soft-tissue invasion was assessed by diagnosing the presence of invasion into the mylohyoid muscle, gingivobuccal fold, and masticator space, and inter-rater agreement was assessed by kappa statistics. The interobserver agreement for bone invasion assessment was almost perfect with CS-3D-T1TFE and substantial with MDCT. The image evaluations by both observers agreed with the pathological evaluations in 15 of the 20 cases, showing high correlation (r > 0.8). CS-3D-T1TFE also showed higher inter-rater agreement than MDCT for all measures of soft-tissue invasion. CS-3D-T1TFE reconstructed images were clinically useful in accurately depicting the extent of mandibular cancer invasion and potentially solving the problem of lesion overestimation associated with conventional MRI. • Reconstructed CS-3D-T1TFE images were useful for the diagnosis of mandibular cancer. • CS-3D-T1TFE images showed higher inter-rater agreement than MDCT and high correlation with pathological findings. • CS-3D-T1TFE images may solve the problem of overestimation of the tumor extent, which has been associated with MRI in the past.",2128

LSCC patients who received open surgery and lymphadenectomy were enrolled and randomized into primary and validation cohorts at a ratio of 7:3 (325 vs. 139). In the primary cohort, we extracted radiomics features from whole intratumoral regions on venous-phase CT images and constructed a radiomics signature by least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression. A radiomics model incorporating the radiomic signature and independent clinical factors was established via multivariable logistic regression and presented as a nomogram. Nomogram performance was compared with a clinical model and traditional CT report with respect to its discrimination and clinical usefulness. The radiomics nomogram was internally tested in an independent validation cohort. The radiomics signature, composed of 9 stable features, was associated with LNM in both the primary and validation cohorts (both p < .001). A radiomics model incorporating independent predictors of LNM (the radiomics signature, tumor subsite, and CT report) showed significantly better discrimination of nodal status than either the clinical model or the CT report in the primary cohort (AUC 0.91 vs. 0.84 vs. 0.68) and validation cohort (AUC 0.89 vs. 0.83 vs. 0.70). Decision curve analysis confirmed that the radiomics nomogram was superior to the clinical model and traditional CT report. The CT-based radiomics nomogram may improve preoperative identification of nodal status and help in clinical decision-making in LSCC. • The radiomics model showed favorable performance for predicting LN metastasis in LSCC patients. • The radiomics model may help in clinical decision-making and define patient subsets benefiting most from neck treatment.",1865

35980435,Prognostic factors of the synovial sarcoma of the extremities: imaging does matter.,European radiology,2023,"Synovial sarcomas (SS) of the extremities are rare soft tissue sarcomas that are more common in young adults. We deciphered the imaging phenotype of SS with the aim to determine if imaging could provide an incremental value to currently known prognostic factors (PF)-age and histological grade-to predict long-term overall survival (OS). This retrospective multicenter study included consecutive pediatric and adult patients with synovial sarcomas of the extremities from December 2002 to August 2020. Inclusion criteria were (i) a follow-up greater than 5 years and (ii) available pre-therapeutic MRI. A subset analysis included MRI and CT-scan. Clinical, pathological, and imaging variables were collected in all patients. The primary endpoint was to evaluate the association of these variables with OS using univariate and multivariate Cox regressions. Out of 428 patients screened for eligibility, 98 patients (mean age: 37.1 ± 15.2 years) were included (MRI: n = 98/98, CT scan: n = 34/98; 35%). The median OS was 75.25 months (IQR = 55.50-109.12) and thirty-six patients (n = 36/98;37%) died during follow-up. The recurrence rate was 12.2% (n =12/98). SS lesions were mostly grade 2 (57/98; 58%). On MRI, SS had a mean long-axis diameter of 67.5 ± 38.3 mm. On CT scan, 44% (15/34) were calcified. Grade (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.71; 95%CI = 1.30-5.66; p = 0.008), size of the lesions evaluated on MRI (HR = 1.02; 95% CI = 1.01-1.03; p < 0.001), and calcifications on CT scan (HR = 0.10; 95% CI = 0.02-0.50; p = 0.005) were independent PF of OS. This study demonstrated that imaging biomarkers can be used to predict long-term outcome in patients with SS. Strikingly, the presence of calcifications on CT scan is associated with favorable outcome and provides an incremental value over existing PF such as age, grade, and size. • Beyond its diagnostic value, MRI is a pre-operative prognostic tool in synovial sarcomas of the extremities since the size of the lesion is an important prognostic factor. • Calcifications on CT scans are independently and significantly associated with prolonged overall survival.",2112

35975887,O-RADS MRI After Initial Ultrasound for Adnexal Lesions: ,AJR. American journal of roentgenology,2023,"The Ovarian-Adnexal Reporting and Data System (O-RADS) ultrasound (US) and MRI risk stratification systems were developed by an international group of experts in adnexal imaging to aid radiologists in assessing adnexal lesions. The goal of imaging is to appropriately triage patients with adnexal lesions. US is the first-line imaging modality for assessment, whereas MRI can be used as a problem-solving tool. Both US and MRI can accurately characterize benign lesions such as simple cysts, endometriomas, hemorrhagic cysts, and dermoid cysts, avoiding unnecessary or inappropriate surgery. In patients with a lesion that does not meet criteria for one of these benign diagnoses, MRI can further characterize the lesion with an improved specificity for cancer and the ability to provide a probable histologic subtype in the presence of certain MRI features. This allows personalized treatment, including avoiding overly extensive surgery or allowing fertility-sparing procedures for suspected benign, borderline, or low-grade tumors. When MRI findings indicate a risk of an invasive cancer, patients can be expeditiously referred to a gynecologic oncologic surgeon. This narrative review provides expert opinion on the utility of multiparametric MRI when using the O-RADS US and MRI management systems.",1303

A deep learning PCa detection model was developed to produce a heatmap of all PIRADS ≥ 2 lesions across prior and current studies. The heatmaps for each patient's prior and current examination were used to extract differential volumetric and likelihood features reflecting explainable changes between examinations. A machine learning classifier was trained to predict from these features csPCa (ISUP > 1) at the current examination according to biopsy. A classifier trained on the current study only was developed for comparison. An extended classifier was developed to incorporate clinical parameters (PSA, PSA density, and age). The cross-validated diagnostic accuracies were compared using ROC analysis. The diagnostic performance of the best model was compared to the radiologist scores. The model including prior and current study (AUC 0.81, CI: 0.69, 0.91) resulted in a higher (p = 0.04) diagnostic accuracy than the current only model (AUC 0.73, CI: 0.61, 0.84).

Between January 2019 and January 2020, seventy-two consecutive patients (55 men, 17 women, median age = 66 years) with solid (prostate, breast, neuroendocrine) cancers at high risk of metastasis or proven multiple myeloma (MM) prospectively underwent a WB-MRI examination including coronal T1, STIR, T2 Dixon and axial diffusion-weighted imaging sequences. Two radiologists independently assessed the combination of T1+STIR sequences and the fat+water reconstructions from the T2 Dixon sequence. The reference standard was established by consensus reading of WB-MRI and concurrent imaging available at baseline and at 6 months. Repeatability and reproducibility of MRI scores (presence and semi-quantitative count of lesions), image quality (SNR: signal-to-noise, CNR: contrast-to-noise, CRR: contrast-to-reference ratios), and diagnostic characteristics (Se: sensitivity, Sp: specificity, Acc: accuracy) were assessed per-skeletal region and per-patient. Repeatability and reproducibility were at least good regardless of the score, region, and protocol (0.67 ≤ AC1 ≤ 0.98). CRR was higher on T2 Dixon fat compared to T1 (p < 0.0001) and on T2 Dixon water compared to STIR (p = 0.0128). In the per-patient analysis, Acc of the T2 Dixon fat+water was higher than that of T1+STIR for the senior reader (Acc = +0.027 [+0.025; +0.029], p < 0.0001) and lower for the junior reader (Acc = -0.029 [-0.031; -0.027], p < 0.0001). A single T2 Dixon sequence with fat+water reconstructions offers similar reproducibility and diagnostic accuracy as the recommended combination of T1+STIR sequences and can be used for skeletal screening in oncology, allowing significant time-saving. • Replacement of the standard anatomic T1 + STIR WB-MRI protocol by a single T2 Dixon sequence drastically shortens the examination time without loss of diagnostic accuracy. • A protocol based on fat + water reconstructions from a single T2 Dixon sequence offers similar inter-reader agreement and a higher contrast-to-reference ratio for detecting lesions compared to the standard T1 + STIR protocol. • Differences in the accuracy between the two protocols are marginal (+ 3% in favor of the T2 Dixon with the senior reader; -3% against the T2 Dixon with the junior reader).",2452

35895122,Comparison of ultrasound-guided radiofrequency ablation versus thyroid lobectomy for T1bN0M0 papillary thyroid carcinoma.,European radiology,2023,"To investigate and compare the clinical outcomes between radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and thyroid lobectomy (TL) for T1bN0M0 papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). This retrospective study evaluated 283 patients with solitary T1bN0M0 PTC treated with RFA (RFA group, 91 patients) or TL (TL group, 192 patients) from May 2014 to November 2018. The patients were regularly followed up after treatment. Local tumor progression, lymph node metastasis (LNM), recurrent tumor, persistent tumor, recurrence-free survival (RFS), treatment variables (hospitalization, procedure time, estimated blood loss, and cost), complication, and delayed surgery were compared. During the follow-up (median [interquartile ranges], 50.4 [18.0] months), no significant differences were found in the local tumor progression (4.4% vs 3.6%, p = 1.000), LNM (1.1% vs 2.1%, p = 0.917), recurrent tumor (2.2% vs 1.6%, p = 1.000), persistent tumor (1.1% vs 0%, p = 0.146), and RFS rate (95.6% vs 96.4%, p = 0.816) in the RFA and TL groups. Distant metastasis was not detected. Patients in the RFA group had a shorter hospitalization (0 vs 7.0 [3.0] days, p < 0.001), shorter procedure time (5.6 [2.9] vs 90.0 [38.5] min, p < 0.001), lower estimated blood loss (0 vs 20 [20] mL, p < 0.001), lower cost ($1972.5 [0.1] vs $2362.4 [1009.3], p < 0.001), and lower complication rate (0 vs 12/192 [6.3%], p = 0.015) than those in the TL group. No patients in the RFA group underwent delayed surgery. This study revealed comparable 4-year clinical outcomes between RFA and TL for T1bN0M0 PTC in terms of local tumor progression and RFS. As a minimally invasive modality, RFA may be a promising feasible alternative to surgery for the treatment of T1bN0M0 PTC in selected patients after strict evaluation. • No significant difference in local tumor progression and RFS was found between RFA and TL for T1bN0M0 PTC during a median follow-up period of 50.4 months. • Compared with TL, RFA led to a shorter hospitalization, lower estimated blood loss, lower cost, and lower complication rate. • RFA may be a promising feasible alternative to surgery for the treatment of T1bN0M0 PTC in selected patients after strict evaluation.",2183
35895121,Contrast-enhanced mammography-guided biopsy: technical feasibility and first outcomes.,European radiology,2023,"To evaluate the feasibility of contrast-enhanced mammography (CEM)-guided biopsy at Hospital del Mar, a Spanish university hospital. We retrospectively reviewed all consecutive women with a suspicious enhancing finding eligible for CEM-guided biopsy, who were prospectively enrolled in a pre-marketing clinical validation and feasibility study (October 2019 to September 2021). CEM-guided biopsy is a stereotactic-based procedure that, by using intravenous iodinated contrast media administration and dual-energy acquisition, provides localisation of enhancing lesions. All the biopsies were performed using a vacuum-assisted device. We collected procedural characteristics (patient position and type of approach), and histopathological results. Feasibility endpoints included success (visualisation of the enhancing lesion, post-procedural biopsy changes and clip placement), procedural time, number of scout acquisitions and complications. A total of 66 suspicious enhancing lesions (18.0% foci, 44.0% mass, 38.0% non-mass enhancement; median size 8.5 mm) in 64 patients (median age 59 years, mostly minimal [48.4%] or mild [32.8%] background parenchymal enhancement) were referred for CEM-guided biopsy in the study period. The success rate was 63/66 (95.4%). Amongst successful procedures, patients were most frequently seated (52/63, 82.5%) and the preferred approach was horizontal (48/63, 76.2%). Median total time per procedure was 15 min. Median number of acquisitions needed before targeting was 2 (range 1-4). Complications consisted of hematoma (17/63, 27%) and vasovagal reaction (2/63, 3.2%). At histology, the malignancy rate was 25/63 (39.7%). In this first patient series, CEM-guided breast biopsy was feasible, with success and complication rates similar to those previously reported for magnetic resonance guidance. • CEM may be used to guide biopsy of enhancing lesions through a stereotactic-based procedure combined with intravenous iodinated contrast media administration and dual-energy acquisition. • In this first patient series (n = 64), the success rate of CEM-guided biopsy was above 95%, the only complications were hematoma (22.2%) and vasovagal reaction (3.2%), and median total time per procedure was 15 min. • CEM-guided biopsy is feasible and could potentially be a widely available biopsy technique for enhancing-only lesions.",2362

We retrospectively examined 112 patients who each had at least two serial gadoxetic acid-enhanced liver MRIs performed at 1 ml/s, first with non-diluted (ND), then with 1:1 saline-diluted (D) contrast. Two blinded readers independently analyzed the artifacts and graded dynamic images using a 5-point scale. The absolute SI of liver parenchyma, focal liver lesions (if present), aorta, and portal vein at the level of the celiac trunk and the SI of the paraspinal muscle were measured in all phases. The signal-to-norm (SI AP artifacts were significantly reduced with dilution. Mean absolute contrast-enhanced liver SI was significantly higher on the D exams compared to the ND exams.

A total of 67 patients with 106 lesions were identified after screening 538 patients who underwent gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI within the SORAMIC trial. All patients were allocated to the trial treatment according to the trial scheme, and 61 of 67 patients received systemic treatment with sorafenib (either alone or combined with locoregional therapies) during the trial period. Follow-up images after treatment according to trial scheme were reviewed for subsequent hypervascularization or > 1 cm size increase. The correlation between progression and several imaging and clinical parameters was assessed using univariable and multivariable analyses. On a median 178 (range, 48-1072) days follow-up period, progression was encountered in 18 (16.9%) lesions in 12 (17.9%) patients. In univariable analysis size > 12.6 mm (p = 0.070), ECOG-PS (p = 0.025), hypointensity at T1-weighted imaging (p = 0.028), hyperintensity at T2-weighted imaging (p < 0.001), hyperintensity at DWI images (p = 0.007), and cirrhosis (p = 0.065) were correlated with progression during follow-up. Hyperintensity at T2 images (p = 0.011) was an independent risk factor for progression in multivariable analysis, as well as cirrhosis (p = 0.033) and ECOG-PS (p = 0.030). Non-hypervascular hepatobiliary phase hypointense lesions are associated with subsequent progression after treatment in patients with HCC. T2 hyperintensity, diffusion restriction, cirrhosis, and higher ECOG-PS could identify lesions with increased risk. These factors should be considered for further diagnostic evaluation or treatment of such lesions. • Non-hypervascular hepatobiliary phase hypointense lesions have considerable risk of progression in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma receiving treatment. • T2 hyperintensity, cirrhosis, ECOG-PS, and hyperintensity at DWI are associated with increased risk of progression. • Non-hypervascular hepatobiliary phase hypointense lesions should be considered in the decision-making process of locoregional therapies, especially in the presence of these risk factors.",2284

Women presenting for mammography for breast cancer follow-up, symptoms, opportunistic screening, or familial risk were asked to participate and, if willing, were randomized to self-compression or radiographer-led compression. Image quality was assessed blindly by two independent radiologists and two radiographers. Pain and discomfort were measured immediately after mammography and their recall was asked when the women participated in the follow-up mammogram, 1 or 2 years later. In total, 495 women (mean age 57 years +/-14) were enrolled, 245 in the self-compression and 250 radiographer-compression arms. Image quality was similar in the two arms (radiologists' judgement p = 0.90; radiographers' judgement p = 0.32). A stronger compression force was reached in the self- than in the radiographer-arm (114.5 vs. 10.25 daN, p < .001), with a 1.7-mm reduction in thickness (p = .14), and almost no impact on dose per exam (1.90 vs. 1.93 mGy, p = .47). Moderate/severe discomfort was reported by 7.8% vs 9.6% (p = .77) and median pain score was 4.0 in both arms (p = .55). Median execution time was 1 min longer with self-compression (10.0 vs. 9.1 min, p < 0.001). No effect on subsequent mammography was detectable (p = 0.47). Self-compression achieved stronger compression of the breast, with comparable image quality, but did not substantially reduce glandular dose. The proportion of women who attended follow-up mammography was also similar in the two groups. clinicaltrials.gov NCT04009278 KEY POINTS: • In mammography, appropriate compression is essential to obtain high image quality and reduce dose. Compression causes pain and discomfort. • Self-compression has been proposed to reach better compression and possibly increase participation in mammography. • In a randomized trial, self-compression reached stronger compression of the breast, with comparable image quality but with no glandular dose reduction or impact on participation in follow-up mammography.",2155

The objective of this study was to demonstrate the feasibility of using an ex vivo MRI-compatible sectioning device for radiologic-pathologic co-localization of lesions in resected liver specimens. In this prospective feasibility study, adults undergoing curative partial hepatectomy from February 2018 to January 2019 were enrolled. Gadoxetic acid was administered intraoperatively prior to hepatic vascular inflow ligation. Liver specimens were stabilized in an MRI-compatible acrylic lesion localization device (27 × 14 × 14 cm A total of 57 lesions were identified radiologically and sectioned in liver specimens from 10 participants with liver metastases (n = 8), primary biliary mucinous cystic neoplasm (n = 1), and hepatic adenomatosis (n = 1). Of these, 38 lesions (67%) were < 1 cm. Overall, 52/57 (91%) of radiologically identified lesions were identified pathologically using the device. Of these, 5 lesions (10%) were not initially identified on gross examination but were confirmed histologically using MRI-guided localization. One lesion was identified grossly but not on MRI. We successfully demonstrated the feasibility of a clinical method for image-guided co-localization and histological characterization of liver lesions using an ex vivo MRI-compatible sectioning device. • The ex vivo MRI-compatible sectioning device provides a reliable method for radiologic-pathologic correlation of small (< 1 cm) liver lesions in human liver specimens. • The sectioning method can be feasibly implemented within a clinical practice setting and used in future efforts to study liver lesion characterization. • Intraoperative administration of gadoxetic acid results in enhancement in ex vivo MRI images of liver specimens hours later with excellent image quality.",1943
35852576,Incidental findings on routine preoperative noncontrast chest computed tomography and chest radiography prior to cardiac surgery in the multicenter randomized controlled CRICKET study.,European radiology,2023,"To describe the prevalence and consequences of incidental findings when implementing routine noncontrast CT prior to cardiac surgery. In the multicenter randomized controlled CRICKET study, 862 adult patients scheduled for cardiac surgery were randomized 1:1 to undergo standard of care (SoC), which included a chest-radiograph, or an additional preoperative noncontrast chest CT-scan (SoC+CT). In this subanalysis, all incidental findings detected on the chest radiograph and CT-scan were analyzed. The influence of smoking status on incidental findings was also evaluated, adjusting for sex, age, and group allocation. Incidental findings were observed in 11.4% (n = 49) of patients in the SoC+CT group and in 3.7% (n = 16) of patients in the SoC-group (p < 0.001). The largest difference was observed in findings requiring follow-up (SoC+CT 7.7% (n = 33) vs SoC 2.3% (n = 10), p < 0.001). Clinically relevant findings changing the surgical approach or requiring specific treatment were observed in 10 patients (1.2%, SoC+CT: 1.6% SoC: 0.7%), including lung cancer in 0.5% of patients (n = 4) and aortic dilatation requiring replacement in 0.2% of patients (n = 2). Incidental findings were more frequent in patients who stopped smoking (OR 1.91, 1.03-3.63) or who actively smoked (OR 3.91, 1.85-8.23). Routine CT-screening increases the rate of incidental findings, mainly by identifying more pulmonary findings requiring follow-up. Incidental findings are more prevalent in patients with a history of smoking, and preoperative CT might increase the yield of identifying lung cancer in these patients. Incidental findings, but not specifically the use of routine CT, are associated with delay of surgery. • Clinically relevant incidental findings are identified more often after a routine preoperative CT-scan, when compared to a standard of care workup, with some findings changing patient management. • Patients with a history of smoking have a higher rate of incidental findings and a lung cancer rate comparable to that of lung cancer screening trials. • We observed no clear delay in the time to surgery when adding routine CT screening.",2145
35849178,Changes in kinetic heterogeneity of breast cancer via computer-aided diagnosis on MRI predict the pathological response to neoadjuvant systemic therapy.,European radiology,2023,"To evaluate whether the computer-aided diagnosis (CAD)-extracted kinetic heterogeneity of breast cancer on MRI and changes therein during treatment were associated with the pathological response to neoadjuvant systemic therapy (NST). Consecutive patients with invasive breast cancer, who underwent NST followed by surgery between 2014 and 2020, were retrospectively evaluated. Using a commercial CAD system, kinetic features (angiovolume, peak enhancement, delayed enhancement profiles, and kinetic heterogeneity) of breast cancer were assessed with pre- and mid-treatment MRI. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify the associations between CAD-extracted kinetic features and pathological complete response (pCR). A total of 130 patients (mean age, 55 years) were included, 37 (28.5%) of whom achieved a pCR. When the pre- and mid-treatment MRI data were compared, the pCR group exhibited greater changes in kinetic heterogeneity (86.14 ± 32.05% vs. 8.50 ± 141.01%, p < 0.001) and angiovolume (95.20 ± 14.29% vs. 19.89 ± 320.16%; p < 0.001) than the non-pCR group. Multivariate regression analysis showed that a large change in kinetic heterogeneity (odds ratio (OR) = 1.030, p < 0.001), age (OR = 0.931, p = 0.005), progesterone receptor negativity (OR = 7.831, p = 0.001), and HER2 positivity (OR = 3.455, p = 0.017) were associated with pCR. A greater change in the CAD-extracted kinetic heterogeneity of breast cancer between pre- and mid-treatment MRI was associated with a pCR in patients on NST. A greater change in kinetic heterogeneity was associated with a pathological complete response. Computer-aided diagnosis-extracted kinetic heterogeneity might serve as a quantitative biomarker of therapeutic efficacy.",1736

35802179,Significant improvement after training in the assessment of lateral compartments and short-axis measurements of lateral lymph nodes in rectal cancer.,European radiology,2023,"In patients with rectal cancer, the size and location of lateral lymph nodes (LLNs) are correlated to increased lateral local recurrence rates. Sufficient knowledge and accuracy when measuring these features are therefore essential. The objective of this study was to evaluate the variation in measurements and anatomical classifications of LLNs before and after training. Fifty-three Dutch radiologists examined three rectal MRI scans and completed a questionnaire. Presence, location, size, and suspiciousness of LLNs were reported. This assessment was repeated after a 2-hour online training by the same radiologists with the same three cases plus three additional cases. Three expert radiologists independently evaluated these 6 cases and served as the standard of reference. Correct identification of the anatomical location improved in case 1 (62 to 77% (p = .077)) and in case 2 (46 to 72% (p = .007)) but decreased in case 3 (92 to 74%, p = .453). Compared to the first three cases, cases 4, 5, and 6 all had a higher initial consensus of 73%, 79%, and 85%, respectively. The mean absolute deviation of the short-axis measurements in cases 1-3 were closer-though not significantly-to the expert reference value after training with reduced ranges and standard deviations. Subjective determination of malignancy had a high consensus rate between participants and experts. Though finding a high consensus rate for determining malignancy of LLNs, variation in short-axis measurements and anatomical location classifications were present and improved after training. Adequate training would support the challenges involved in evaluating LLNs appropriately. • Variation was present in the assessment of the anatomical location and short-axis size of lateral lymph nodes. • In certain cases, the accuracy of short-axis measurements and anatomical location, when compared to an expert reference value, improved after a training session. • Consensus before and after training on whether an LLN was subjectively considered to be suspicious for malignancy was high.",2062
35779088,Tumor volume doubling time estimated from digital breast tomosynthesis mammograms distinguishes invasive breast cancers from benign lesions.,European radiology,2023,"The aim of this study was to determine whether lesion size metrics on consecutive screening mammograms could predict malignant invasive carcinoma versus benign lesion outcome. We retrospectively reviewed suspicious screen-detected lesions confirmed by biopsy to be invasive breast cancers or benign that were visible on current and in-retrospect prior screening mammograms performed with digital breast tomosynthesis from 2017 to 2020. Four experienced radiologists recorded mammogram dates, breast density, lesion type, lesion diameter, and morphology on current and prior exams. We used logistic regression models to evaluate the association of invasive breast cancer outcome with lesion size metrics such as maximum dimension, average dimension, volume, and tumor volume doubling time (TVDT). Twenty-eight patients with invasive ductal carcinoma or invasive lobular carcinoma and 40 patients with benign lesions were identified. The mean TVDT was significantly shorter for invasive breast cancers compared to benign lesions (0.84 vs. 2.5 years; p = 0.0025). Patients with a TVDT of less than 1 year were shown to have an odds ratio of invasive cancer of 6.33 (95% confidence interval, 2.18-18.43). Logistic regression adjusted for age, lesion maximum dimension, and lesion volume demonstrated that shorter TVDT was the size variable significantly associated with invasive cancer outcome. Invasive breast cancers detected on current and in-retrospect prior screening mammograms are associated with shorter TVDT compared to benign lesions. If confirmed to be sufficiently predictive of benignity in larger studies, lesions visible on mammograms which in comparison to prior exams have longer TVDTs could potentially avoid additional imaging and/or biopsy. • We propose tumor volume doubling time as a measure to distinguish benign from invasive breast cancer lesions. • Logistic regression results summarized the utility of the odds ratio in retrospective clinical mammography data.",1983
35779087,Impact of a content-based image retrieval system on the interpretation of chest CTs of patients with diffuse parenchymal lung disease.,European radiology,2023,"Content-based image retrieval systems (CBIRS) are a new and potentially impactful tool for radiological reporting, but their clinical evaluation is largely missing. This study aimed at assessing the effect of CBIRS on the interpretation of chest CT scans from patients with suspected diffuse parenchymal lung disease (DPLD). A total of 108 retrospectively included chest CT scans with 22 unique, clinically and/or histopathologically verified diagnoses were read by eight radiologists (four residents, four attending, median years reading chest CT scans 2.1± 0.7 and 12 ± 1.8, respectively). The radiologists read and provided the suspected diagnosis at a certified radiological workstation to simulate clinical routine. Half of the readings were done without CBIRS and half with the additional support of the CBIRS. The CBIRS retrieved the most likely of 19 lung-specific patterns from a large database of 6542 thin-section CT scans and provided relevant information (e.g., a list of potential differential diagnoses). Reading time decreased by 31.3% (p < 0.001) despite the radiologists searching for additional information more frequently when the CBIRS was available (154 [72%] vs. 95 [43%], p < 0.001). There was a trend towards higher overall diagnostic accuracy (42.2% vs 34.7%, p = 0.083) when the CBIRS was available. The use of the CBIRS had a beneficial impact on the reading time of chest CT scans in cases with DPLD. In addition, both resident and attending radiologists were more likely to consult informational resources if they had access to the CBIRS. Further studies are needed to confirm the observed trend towards increased diagnostic accuracy with the use of a CBIRS in practice. • A content-based image retrieval system for supporting the diagnostic process of reading chest CT scans can decrease reading time by 31.3% (p < 0.001). • The decrease in reading time was present despite frequent usage of the content-based image retrieval system. • Additionally, a trend towards higher diagnostic accuracy was observed when using the content-based image retrieval system (42.2% vs 34.7%, p = 0.083).",2117

This study assesses the impact of an intervention, namely a prostate MRI quality training lecture, on the participant's ability to apply PI-QUAL. Sixteen participants (radiologists, urologists, physicists, and computer scientists) of varying experience in reviewing diagnostic prostate MRI all assessed the image quality of ten examinations from different vendors and machines. Then, they attended a dedicated lecture followed by a hands-on workshop on MRI quality assessment using the PI-QUAL score. Five scans assessed by the participants were evaluated in the workshop using the PI-QUAL score for teaching purposes. After the course, the same participants evaluated the image quality of a new set of ten scans applying the PI-QUAL score. Results were assessed using receiver operating characteristic analysis. The reference standard was the PI-QUAL score assessed by one of the developers of PI-QUAL. There was a significant improvement in average area under the curve for the evaluation of image quality from baseline (0.59 [95 % confidence intervals: 0.50-0.66]) to post-teaching (0.96 [0.92-0.98]), an improvement of 0.37 [0.21-0.41] (p < 0.001).

This study aimed to establish a CT-based radiomics signature to predict MSI status in patients with CRC. A total of 837 CRC patients who underwent preoperative enhanced CT and had available MSI status data were recruited from two hospitals. Radiomics features were extracted from segmented tumours, and a series of data balancing and feature selection strategies were used to select MSI-related features. Finally, an MSI-related radiomics signature was constructed using a genetic algorithm-enhanced artificial neural network model. Combined and clinical models were constructed using multivariate logistic regression analyses by integrating the clinical factors with or without the signature. A Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was conducted to explore the prognostic information of the signature in patients with CRC. Ten features were selected to construct a signature which showed robust performance in both the internal and external validation cohorts, with areas under the curves (AUC) of 0.788 and 0.775, respectively. The performance of the signature was comparable to that of the combined model (AUCs of 0.777 and 0.767, respectively) and it outperformed the clinical model constituting age and tumour location (AUCs of 0.768 and 0.623, respectively). Survival analysis demonstrated that the signature could stratify patients with stage II CRC according to prognosis (HR: 0.402, p = 0.029). This study built a robust radiomics signature for identifying the MSI status of CRC patients, which may assist individualised treatment decisions. • Our well-designed modelling strategies helped overcome the problem of data imbalance caused by the low incidence of MSI. • Genetic algorithm-enhanced artificial neural network-based CT radiomics signature can effectively distinguish the MSI status of CRC patients. • Kaplan-Meier survival analysis demonstrated that our signature could significantly stratify stage II CRC patients into high- and low-risk groups.",2108

39745682,Transplant and Nontransplant Salvage Therapy in Pediatric Relapsed or Refractory Hodgkin Lymphoma: The EuroNet-PHL-R1 Phase 3 Nonrandomized Clinical Trial.,JAMA oncology,2025,"The current standard-of-care salvage therapy in relapsed/refractory classic Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) includes consolidation high-dose chemotherapy (HDCT)/autologous stem cell transplant (aSCT). To investigate whether presalvage risk factors and fludeoxyglucose-18 (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) response to reinduction chemotherapy can guide escalation or de-escalation between HDCT/aSCT or transplant-free consolidation with radiotherapy to minimize toxic effects while maintaining high cure rates. EuroNet-PHL-R1 was a nonrandomized clinical trial that enrolled patients younger than 18 years with first relapsed/refractory cHL across 68 sites in 13 countries in Europe between January 2007 and January 2013. Data were analyzed between September 2022 and July 2024. Reinduction chemotherapy consisted of alternating IEP (ifosfamide, etoposide, prednisolone) and ABVD (adriamycin, bleomycin, vinblastine, dacarbazine). Patients with low-risk disease (late relapse after 2 cycles of first-line chemotherapy and any relapse with an adequate response after 1 IEP/ABVD defined as complete metabolic response on FDG-PET and at least 50% volume reduction) received a second IEP/ABVD cycle and radiotherapy (RT) to all sites involved at relapse. Patients with high-risk disease (all primary progressions and relapses with inadequate response after 1 IEP/ABVD cycle) received a second IEP/ABVD cycle plus HDCT/aSCT with or without RT. The primary end point was 5-year event-free survival. Secondary end points were overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). PFS was identical to event-free survival because no secondary cancers were observed. PFS data alone are presented for simplicity. Of 118 patients analyzed, 58 (49.2%) were female, and the median (IQR) age was 16.3 (14.5-17.6) years. The median (IQR) follow-up was 67.5 (58.5-77.0) months. The overall 5-year PFS was 71.3% (95% CI, 63.5%-80.1%), and OS was 82.7% (95% CI, 75.8%-90.1%). For patients in the low-risk group (n = 59), 41 received nontransplant salvage with a 5-year PFS of 89.7% (95% CI, 80.7%-99.8%) and OS of 97.4% (95% CI, 92.6%-100%). In contrast, 18 received HDCT/aSCT off protocol, with a 5-year PFS of 88.9% (95% CI, 75.5%-100%) and OS of 100%. All 59 patients with high-risk disease received HDCT/aSCT (and 23 received post-HDCT/aSCT RT) with a 5-year PFS of 53.3% (95% CI, 41.8%-67.9%) and OS of 66.5% (95% CI, 54.9%-80.5%). In this nonrandomized clinical trial, FDG-PET response-guided salvage in relapsed cHL may identify patients in whom transplant-free salvage achieves excellent outcomes. HDCT/aSCT may be reserved for primary progression and relapsed cHL with inadequate response.

38452721,Propranolol monotherapy in angiosarcoma - A window-of-opportunity study (PropAngio).,"European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",2024,"Angiosarcoma is a rare and aggressive cancer of the endothelial cells. Propranolol, a non-selective β-blocker, was able to initiate apoptosis in angiosarcoma cell lines and its anti-tumor activity has been described in several case reports. The aim of this trial was to prospectively evaluate the anti-tumor activity of propranolol monotherapy in patients with angiosarcoma before proceeding to standard of care treatment. Propranolol was dosed 80 mg to 240 mg/day for 3 to 6 weeks according to a dose titration schedule. The primary endpoint was clinical response (response according to RECIST 1.1 or stable disease with improvement of cutaneous lesions) in at least three patients. Exploratory objectives included histologic response (>30% decrease in Ki-67), FDG PET response, and β-receptor expression levels. Fourteen patients were enrolled. The median duration of treatment was 26 days (range 21-42 days). The median highest propranolol dose was 160 mg/day (range 80 - 240 mg). Two patients showed clinical response (14%, 95% CI 3-100%). One of these patients showed a partial metabolic response on PET-CT. None of the tumors showed histologic response. The most common adverse event was grade 1/2 bradycardia (86%). There were no grade ≥ 3 adverse events. ADRB2 was overexpressed in 16 out of 18 tumors, in both responders and non-responders. None of the tumors showed ADRB1 overexpression. This window-of-opportunity trial did not show clinical efficacy of propranolol monotherapy. However, two out of 14 patients did show clinical benefit. ADRB1/2 expression did not correlate with clinical response.",Alaa Embaby; Kimberley M Heinhuis; Nikki S IJzerman; Anne Miek Koenen; Stephanie van der Kleij
37515634,Efficacy evaluation of neoadjuvant immunotherapy plus chemotherapy for non-small-cell lung cancer: comparison of PET/CT with postoperative pathology.,European radiology,2023,"To assess the value of positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) in the efficacy evaluation of patients undergoing neoadjuvant immunotherapy plus chemotherapy, and to analyze its correlation with postoperative pathology. The PET/CT metabolic parameters and CT size were retrospectively analyzed before and after neoadjuvant immunotherapy plus chemotherapy in 67 patients with resectable stage II/IIIA non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). CT assessment based on immune response evaluation criteria in solid tumor criteria ((i)RECIST) was compared with PET/CT assessment based on the response criteria in solid tumors (PERCIST). The correlations between PET/CT metabolic parameters and postoperative pathology were analyzed. The value of PET/CT in the efficacy evaluation was assessed. The PET/CT assessment showed high consistency with postoperative pathological evaluation, yet the CT assessment showed low consistency with postoperative pathological evaluation. The (i)RECIST and PERCIST criteria showed statistically significant differences (p < 0.001). The postoperative pathological response was negatively associated with ΔSUV The PERCIST criteria are more sensitive and accurate than (i)RECIST criteria to identify more responders when evaluating the response of neoadjuvant immunotherapy plus chemotherapy for NSCLC. PET/CT shows high accuracy in predicting postoperative pathological response. Our study shows the important role PET/CT plays in the efficacy evaluation of NSCLC patients undergoing neoadjuvant immunotherapy plus chemotherapy, as well as in predicting the prognosis and guiding postoperative treatment. Neoadjuvant immunotherapy plus chemotherapy is highly effective in the treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer. And PET/CT played an important role in the efficacy evaluation following neoadjuvant immunotherapy plus chemotherapy for non-small-cell lung cancer. • Neoadjuvant immunotherapy plus chemotherapy is highly effective in the treatment of NSCLC. • The PERCIST criteria are more sensitive and accurate than (i)RECIST criteria to identify more responders when evaluating the response of neoadjuvant immunotherapy plus chemotherapy for NSCLC. • PET/CT played an important role in the efficacy evaluation; ΔSUVmax (%), ΔSUVmean (%), and ΔSUVpeak (%) following neoadjuvant immunotherapy plus chemotherapy for NSCLC had high consistency and strong correlations with postoperative pathology.",You Cheng; Zhi-Yong Chen; Jian-Jiang Huang; Dan Shao
36920518,Metabolic tumour and nodal response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy on FDG PET-CT as a predictor of pathological response and survival in patients with oesophageal adenocarcinoma.,European radiology,2023,"2-deoxy-2[ Cohort study of 75 patients with oesophageal or oesophago-gastric junction (GOJ) adenocarcinoma treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy then surgery at Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust, London (2017-2020). Standardised uptake value (SUV) metrics on pre- and post-treatment FDG PET-CT in the primary tumour (mTR) and loco-regional lymph nodes (mNR) were derived. Optimum SUV Optimum tumour SUV Metabolic tumour and nodal response predicted pTR and pNR, respectively, in patients with oesophageal or GOJ adenocarcinoma. However, currently utilised response criteria may not be optimal. pTR, mTR, pNR and mNR were independent predictors of survival. • FDG PET-CT has an emerging role in evaluating response to neoadjuvant therapy in patients with oesophageal cancer. • Prospective cohort study demonstrated that metabolic response in the primary tumour and lymph nodes was predictive of pathological response in a cohort of patients with adenocarcinoma of the oesophagus or oesophago-gastric junction treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgical resection. • Patients who demonstrated a response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in the primary tumour or lymph nodes on FDG PET-CT demonstrated better survival and reduced rates of tumour recurrence.",Jonathan L Moore; Manil Subesinghe; Aida Santaolalla; Michael Green; Harriet Deere
36302172,Meta-Analysis of the Test-Retest Repeatability of [18F]-Fluorodeoxyglucose Standardized Uptake Values: Implications for Assessment of Tumor Response.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,2023,"Currently, guidelines for PET with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG-PET) interpretation for assessment of therapy response in oncology primarily involve visual evaluation of FDG-PET/CT scans. However, quantitative measurements of the metabolic activity in tumors may be even more useful in evaluating response to treatment. Guidelines based on such measurements, including the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Criteria and PET Response Criteria in Solid Tumors, have been proposed. However, more rigorous analysis of response criteria based on FDG-PET measurements is needed to adopt regular use in practice. Well-defined boundaries of repeatability and reproducibility of quantitative measurements to discriminate noise from true signal changes are a needed initial step. An extension of the meta-analysis from de Langen and colleagues (2012) of the test-retest repeatability of quantitative FDG-PET measurements, including mean, maximum, and peak standardized uptake values (SUVmax, SUVmean, and SUVpeak, respectively), was performed. Data from 11 studies in the literature were used to estimate the relationship between the variance in test-retest measurements with uptake level and various study-level, patient-level, and lesion-level characteristics. Test-retest repeatability of percentage fluctuations for all three types of SUV measurement (max, mean, and peak) improved with higher FDG uptake levels. Repeatability in all three SUV measurements varied for different lesion locations. Worse repeatability in SUVmean was also associated with higher tumor volumes. On the basis of these results, recommendations regarding SUV measurements for assessing minimal detectable changes based on repeatability and reproducibility are proposed. These should be applied to differentiate between response categories for a future set of FDG-PET-based criteria that assess clinically significant changes in tumor response.",Lalitha K Shankar; Erich Huang; Saskia Litiere; Otto S Hoekstra; Larry Schwartz
35972356,Prospective Evaluation of Immune Activation Associated with Response to Radioembolization Assessed with PET/CT in Women with Breast Cancer Liver Metastasis.,Radiology,2023,"Background The impact of transarterial radioembolization (TARE) of breast cancer liver metastasis (BCLM) on antitumor immunity is unknown, which hinders the optimal selection of candidates for TARE. Purpose To determine whether response to TARE at PET/CT in participants with BCLM is associated with specific immune markers (cytokines and immune cell populations). Materials and Methods This prospective pilot study enrolled 23 women with BCLM who planned to undergo TARE (June 2018 to February 2020). Peripheral blood and liver tumor biopsies were collected at baseline and 1-2 months after TARE. Monocyte, myeloid-derived suppressor cell (MDSC), interleukin (IL), and tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) levels were assessed with use of gene expression studies and flow cytometry, and immune checkpoint and cell surface marker levels with immunohistochemistry. Modified PET Response Criteria in Solid Tumors was used to determine complete response (CR) in treated tissue. After log-transformation, immune marker levels before and after TARE were compared using paired ",Amy R Deipolyi; C Bryce Johnson; Christopher C Riedl; Henry Kunin; Stephen B Solomon
